Section 25-405 ::    
        
     
        § 25-405 District plan.
        (a) The mayor may provide for the preparation of a district plan, upon
      his  or her own initiative, or at the request of an individual or agency
      designated by him or her, or at the request of the city council, or upon
      the written petition, signed and acknowledged, of (1) the owners  of  at
      least  fifty-one  percent  of  the assessed valuation of all the taxable
      real property  within  the  boundaries  of  the  district  proposed  for
      establishment   or   extension,  as  shown  upon  the  latest  completed
      assessment roll of the city, and (2) at least fifty-one percent  of  the
      owners  of  real  property  within  the  area  included  in the district
      proposed for the establishment or extension.
        (b) The establishment or extension of a district shall be  based  upon
      the  district  plan  filed  in  the  office of the city clerk, except as
      provided in subdivision (c) of this section.
        (c) The district plan shall first be submitted to  the  city  planning
      commission  which  shall  forward  a  copy  within five days to the city
      council and to the council member or members  representing  the  council
      district  or districts in which the proposed district is located, to the
      community board or boards for the community  district  or  districts  in
      which  the  proposed  district is located, and to the respective borough
      board and borough president, if the plan involves properties located  in
      two  or  more community districts. Each community board shall notify the
      public  of  the  proposed  plan  in  accordance  with  the  requirements
      established  by  the  city planning commission, and may conduct a public
      hearing and  submit  a  written  recommendation  to  the  city  planning
      commission  not  later  than  thirty days after receipt of the plan. The
      city planning commission shall review the plan and recommendations, and,
      after a public hearing, prepare a report. The city  planning  commission
      shall submit its report to the mayor, to the affected borough president,
      to  the  city  council and to the council member or members representing
      the council district or districts in  which  the  proposed  district  is
      located,  together  with  copies  of  any  recommendation of a community
      board, within sixty days from the date of expiration  of  the  community
      board's  period  for  reviewing the plan and submitting recommendations.
      This report shall certify the  city  planning  commission's  unqualified
      approval,  disapproval  or  qualified  approval with recommendations for
      modifications of the district plan. A copy of this report together  with
      the original district plan shall be transmitted for filing with the city
      clerk.  In  the  event the city planning commission shall fail to submit
      its report within ninety-five days of receipt of the  original  district
      plan,  it shall be required to immediately transmit the original plan to
      the city clerk for filing and no report of the city planning  commission
      shall be necessary.
        (d)  All  district  plans  shall conform with the requirements of this
      chapter. The mayor may determine that the plan or any part of the  plan,
      shall  be  prepared  by,  or  under the supervision of city officers and
      employees to be designated by the mayor, or by persons or  firms  to  be
      employed for that purpose. Except as otherwise provided in this chapter,
      the expense incurred for the preparation of the plan or part of the plan
      shall be a city charge.
        (e)  If  the city shall thereafter establish or extend the district or
      provide the improvements or additional  services  or  contract  for  the
      required  services, the expense incurred by the city for the preparation
      of the plan or any part of the plan shall be deemed to be  part  of  the
      cost  of  the  improvement, or the rendering of additional services, and
      the city shall be reimbursed in the amount paid, or the portion of  that
      amount which the city council, at a public hearing held pursuant to this
      chapter, shall allocate against the district.

        (a)  After  the  filing of the district plan in the office of the city

      available by the clerk, and, further, that if (1)  owners  of  at  least
      fifty-one  percent  of  the assessed valuation of all the benefited real
      property situated within the boundaries of  the  district  proposed  for
      establishment   or   extension,  as  shown  upon  the  latest  completed
      assessment roll of the city, or (2) at least fifty-one  percent  of  the
      owners  of  benefited  real  property  within  the  area included in the
      district  proposed  for  establishment  or  extension,  so  file   their
      objections, the district will not be established or extended.
        (c) The city council shall cause a copy of the resolution or a summary
      thereof  to be published at least once in the City Record or a newspaper
      in general circulation in the city, the first publication to be not less

      on  the  latest  city  assessment  roll,  to  such  other persons as are
      registered with the city to receive tax bills concerning  real  property
      within the proposed district, and to the tenants of each building within
      the  proposed district. If the city council publishes or mails a summary
      of the resolution, such summary shall include the  business  address  of
      the  city clerk, a statement that copies of the resolution shall be made
      available free of charge to the public, the  improvements  proposed  and
      the  maximum  cost  thereof,  the  total  annual  amount  proposed to be

      indicating the rights of owners to object pursuant to subdivision (b) of
      this section.
        (d)  The  resolution  may further state the place, other than the city
      clerk's office, where the district plan may be inspected in  advance  of
      the  hearing,  if  the  city  council  determines  that,  in  the public
      interest, any additional place of inspection is necessary or desirable.
    
    
    
    
    
    
    

Section 25-407
--------------

Section 25-407 ::    
        
     
        § 25-407 Establishment or extension of the district.
        (a)  Not earlier than thirty days after the conclusion of the last day
      of the public hearing held pursuant to section 25-406 of  this  chapter,
      the city council shall determine:
        (1) whether the notice of hearing for all hearings required to be held
      was published and mailed as required by law and is otherwise sufficient;
        (2)  except  as  otherwise provided in section 25-403 of this chapter,
      whether all the real property within  the  boundaries  of  the  proposed
      district  or  extension will benefit from the establishment or extension
      of the district;
        (3) whether all the real property benefited  is  included  within  the
      limits of the proposed district or extension; and
        (4)  whether  the establishment or extension of the district is in the
      public interest.
        (b) (1) If the city council shall determine the question of  paragraph
      four  of  subdivision  (a)  of  this  section in the negative, or if the
      requisite number of owners shall have filed their objections as provided
      in section 25-406 of this  chapter,  the  city  council  shall  adopt  a
      resolution  disapproving the establishment or extension of the district,
      stating the reasons for its determination and  enter  the  same  in  the
      minutes  of its proceedings. Thereafter no plan for the establishment or
      extension of a district to include any part of the property proposed  to
      be  included  in the disapproved district may be prepared as provided in
      section 25-405 of this chapter until the expiration of at least one year
      from the date of disapproval.
        (2) If the city council shall find  that  notice  was  incorrectly  or
      insufficiently  given  or  that, except as otherwise provided in section
      25-403 of this chapter, any part or portion of the real property  within
      the  boundaries  of  the proposed district or extension is not benefited
      thereby or that certain property benefited thereby has not been included
      therein, it shall call a further hearing at a definite  place  and  time
      not less than ten nor more than thirty days after this determination. In
      the  resolution  calling  such  hearing,  it shall specify the necessary
      changes, if any, to the boundaries of the proposed district or extension
      to be made in order that, except as otherwise provided in section 25-403
      of this chapter, all of the real property and only that real property as
      is deemed benefited shall be  included  within  the  boundaries  of  the
      proposed  district  or  extension.  Such a further hearing shall also be
      required in the event that  the  city  council  proposes  to  amend  the
      district  plan  to reduce improvements or services or provide additional
      improvements or services not included in the original plan prior to  the
      establishment  of  the  district. Notice of the further hearing shall be
      published and mailed in the manner provided in section  25-406  of  this
      chapter,  except  that,  where boundaries are to be altered, this notice
      shall also specify the manner in which  it  is  proposed  to  alter  the
      boundaries  of  the  proposed district or extension. The further hearing
      shall be conducted in the same manner as the original hearing.
        (c) If and when the city council shall determine  in  the  affirmative
      all  of  the questions set forth in subdivision (a) of this section, and
      provided that the requisite number of owners shall not have objected  as
      provided  in  section  25-406  of this chapter, it may adopt a local law
      approving  the  establishment  or  extension  of  the  district  as  the
      boundaries  shall  be  finally  determined  and  the construction of the
      improvement or providing of the service in the district. Such local  law
      shall  become effective only upon compliance with section 25-408 of this
      chapter.
        (d) Upon the recommendation of the district management association and
      after a public hearing, the city council may adopt a local  law  at  any
    
      time  prior  to  or  after the establishment of a district to change the
      method of assessment as set forth in the plan.  Notice  of  such  public
      hearing  and  a description of the proposed change shall be given in the
      manner set forth in section 25-406 of this chapter.

      publication  of  the  copy  or  summary  of  the  local  law pursuant to
      subdivision (b) of this section. No  review  shall  be  had  unless  the
      petitioner shall give an undertaking approved by the supreme court, or a
      justice  thereof,  as to form, amount and sufficiency of sureties, that,
      in the event of failure to modify the local law, he or she will  pay  to
      the  city all costs and expenses as are incurred by it on account of the
      proceedings, as shall be determined by the court. In the event that upon
      this review there shall be any modification by the court  of  the  local
      law,  the court shall direct the modification by judgment which shall be
      final and conclusive, and the city clerk shall cause the judgment to  be
      recorded  and  filed  in the same places and manner as was the local law
      which was modified.

        § 25-410 Amendments to the district plan.
        (a)  At  any  time  after the establishment or extension of a district
      pursuant to the provisions of this chapter, the district plan upon which
      the establishment or extension was based, may, upon  the  recommendation
      of  the  district management association, be amended by the city council
      after compliance with the procedures set forth in this section.
        (b) Amendments to the  district  plan  which  provide  for  additional
      improvements  or services or any change in the method of assessment upon
      which the district charge is based, or an increase only in the amount to
      be  expended  annually  for  improvements,  services,  maintenance   and
      operation  may  be  adopted by local law, provided that the city council
      shall, after a public hearing,  determine  that  it  is  in  the  public
      interest  to authorize the additional improvements, services or increase
      in the maximum annual amount and that the tax and debt limits prescribed
      in section 25-412 of this chapter will not be exceeded. The city council
      shall give notice of the hearing by publication of a notice in at  least
      one  newspaper having general circulation in the district specifying the
      time when and the place where the hearing will be held and  stating  the
      increase  proposed  in  the maximum amount to be expended annually. This
      notice shall be published once at least  ten  days  prior  to  the  date
      specified for the hearing.
        (c)  Amendments to the district plan which provide for the district to
      incur indebtedness in order to provide for  additional  improvements  or
      which provide for an increase in the total maximum amount to be expended
      for  improvements in the district, may be adopted by local law, provided
      that the city council shall, after a public hearing, determine  that  it
      is   in   the  public  interest  to  authorize  the  district  to  incur
      indebtedness to provide for additional improvements or to  increase  the
      maximum total amount to be expended for improvements in the district and
      that  the  tax  and  debt  limits  prescribed  in section 25-412 of this
      chapter will not be exceeded. Notice of the hearing shall  be  published
      and mailed in the manner provided in section 25-406 of this chapter. The
      local  law  adopted  pursuant to this subdivision shall not be effective
      until reviewed by the  state  comptroller  in  accordance  with  section
      25-408 of this chapter.

--------------

Section 25-411 ::    
        
     
        §  25-411  Expense  of  the  district. (a) The expense incurred in the
      construction or operation of any improvement or provision of  additional
      services  in  a  district  pursuant to this chapter shall be financed in
      accordance with the  district  plan  upon  which  the  establishment  or
      extension  of  the  district  was  based.  Services  for  which district
      property owners are charged pursuant to the plan must be in addition  to
      or  an enhancement of those provided by the city prior to the district's
      establishment. The  expense  and  cost  apportioned  to  benefited  real
      property  in  accordance  with  the  plan  shall  be  a charge upon each
      benefited parcel of real property within the district.
        (b) The charge upon benefited real property pursuant to  this  chapter
      shall  be  imposed  as  provided  in  the  district plan. If the formula
      includes an ad valorem component, this component shall be determined  by
      the  assessed  value  of  each parcel as entered on the latest completed
      assessment roll used by the city for the levy of general city taxes. The
      charge shall be determined, levied and collected in the same manner,  at
      the same time and by the same officers, as general city taxes are levied
      and collected.
        (c) When a district has been established pursuant to this chapter, the
      city  may,  for  the  purpose  of  providing  funds  for  making capital
      improvements within  such  district,  issue  and  sell  bonds  or  other
      municipal  obligations  as  provided  in the local finance law and other
      applicable laws and statutes. Principal and interest payments  on  these
      bonds  or  other  municipal  obligations may be made in whole or in part
      from the proceeds of charges imposed upon benefited real property within
      the district.

Section 25-412 ::    
        
     
        §  25-412  Tax  and  debt  limitations.  (a)  The  aggregate amount of
      outstanding indebtedness that is incurred to provide funds  for  capital
      improvements  pursuant  to  this chapter shall be chargeable against the
      city's constitutional debt limit and may not exceed ten percent  of  the
      amount  allowable  under that limit. The aggregate amount of outstanding
      indebtedness that is incurred to provide funds for capital  improvements
      pursuant  to  this  chapter  and that is chargeable against the property
      within the district may not exceed seven percent  of  the  average  full
      valuation of taxable real property in the district.
        (b)  The district charge, exclusive of debt service, levied in a given
      year against real property in a district may not exceed  twenty  percent
      of  the total general city taxes levied in that year against the taxable
      real property in the district. The district charge so  levied  shall  be
      included  in the total amount, if any, that the city is permitted by law
      to raise in that year by a tax on real property.

      imposed  pursuant  to  this chapter shall be held by the comptroller and
      shall be separately accounted for in the books and records of the  city.
      None  of  the  proceeds collected pursuant to this chapter shall be used
      for any purposes other than those set forth in the district plan.  These
      funds  may  be  paid  out  for  district purposes in accordance with the
      general procedures for payment of other city expenditures.
        (b) All contracts for improvements, goods or services to  be  provided
      in the district shall be subject to all applicable provisions of the law

        (a) There shall be a district management association for each district
      established  pursuant  to  the  provisions  of this chapter (which shall
      pursuant to the not-for-profit corporation law have one or more  classes
      of membership, voting or nonvoting) for the purpose of carrying out such
      activities  as  may  be  prescribed  in  the  plan.  Notwithstanding any
      inconsistent provision of paragraph (e) of section six hundred eleven of
      the not-for-profit corporation law, the certificate of incorporation  or
      by-laws  of  such association shall provide for voting representation of
      owners of property and tenants within the district, and may provide that
      the votes of members who are property owners be weighted  in  proportion
      to  the  assessment levied or to be levied against the properties within
      the district, provided that in no case shall the total number  of  votes
      assigned  to  any one such member or to any number of such members under
      common ownership or control exceed thirty-three and one-third percent of
      the total number of votes which may be cast.
        (b) The board of directors of the association  shall  be  composed  of
      representatives  of  owners  and  tenants within the district, provided,
      however, that not less than a majority of its  members  shall  represent
      owners  and  provided  further  that  tenants  of  commercial  space and
      dwelling units within the district shall  also  be  represented  on  the
      board.  The  board  shall include, in addition, four members, one member
      appointed by each of the following:  the  mayor,  the  comptroller,  the
      borough  president  of  the borough in which the district is located and
      the council member  representing  the  council  district  in  which  the
      proposed  district is located, or if the proposed district is located in
      more than one council district, by the speaker of the city council after
      consultation with the council members representing the council districts
      in which the proposed district is located. The additional  four  members
      shall  serve  as  the  incorporators  of the association pursuant to the
      not-for-profit corporation law.  The  association  may  be  incorporated
      prior to the effective date of any district established pursuant to this
      chapter.
        (c)  In  addition  to such other powers as are conferred on it by law,
      the district management association may make recommendations to the city
      council with  respect  to  any  matter  involving  or  relating  to  the
      district.
        (d)  For  such consideration as it may deem appropriate and consistent
      with the powers granted pursuant to section 25-404 of this chapter,  the
      city council may license or grant to the district management association
      the  right to undertake or permit commercial activities or other private
      uses of the streets or other parts of the district in which the city has
      any real property interest.

      pursuant  to  the  provisions  of  this  chapter,  where  there  is   no
      indebtedness,  outstanding and unpaid, incurred to accomplish any of the
      purposes of the district, may be dissolved by  local  law  of  the  city
      council  upon  its  own  motion  or upon the written petition of (1) the

      the district and (2)  at  least  fifty-one  percent  of  the  owners  of
      benefited  real  property  within the area included in the district. The
      city council shall request  and  consider  the  recommendations  of  the
      district  management  association  concerning  any proposed dissolution;
      provided that if the association has not  submitted  recommendations  to
      the  city  council  within  sixty  days after request therefor, the city
      council may adopt any such proposed dissolution without considering such
      recommendations. In the event of dissolution, all assets of the district
      shall revert to the city.
        (b) A certified copy of the order of dissolution shall be  filed  with
