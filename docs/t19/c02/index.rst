      alleged  in  the  notice.  Such notice of violation shall also contain a

      and time provided shall be deemed, for all  purposes,  an  admission  of
      liability  and  that  a  default  judgment may be rendered. The form and
      wording of the notice of violation shall be prescribed by the  director.
      A copy of each notice of violation served shall be filed and retained by
      the  bureau, and shall be deemed a record kept in the ordinary course of

      his  or  her name, together with the license designation as shown by the
      registration plates on said vehicle,  shall  be  inserted  therein.  The
      notice  of violation shall be served upon the owner of the motor vehicle
      if the operator is not present, by affixing such notice to said  vehicle
      in  a  conspicuous place. Whenever such notice is so affixed, in lieu of
      inserting the name of the person charged with the violation in the space
      provided for the identification of said person, the words "owner of  the
      motor  vehicle  bearing  license"  may be inserted to be followed by the
      license designation as shown by the registration plates on said vehicle.
      Service of the notice of violation  by  affixation  as  herein  provided
      shall  have  the  same force and effect and shall be subject to the same
      penalties for disregard thereof as though the same was personally served

      not the owner thereof but who uses or operates  such  vehicle  with  the

      served on such operator or served by affixation in the manner aforesaid,
      and  service  made  in  either  manner  as herein provided shall also be
      deemed to be lawful service upon such owner.

Section 19-206 ::    
        
     
        §  19-206  Hearings.  a.  Notice of hearing. Whenever a person charged
      with a parking violation enters a plea of not guilty, the  bureau  shall
      advise such person personally or by registered or certified mail, return
      receipt  requested, of the date on which he or she must appear to answer
      the charge at a hearing. The form and content of such notice of  hearing
      shall  be  prescribed  by  the  director, and shall contain a warning to
      advise the person so  pleading  that  failure  to  appear  on  the  date
      designated,  or  on  any subsequent adjourned date, shall be deemed, for
      all purposes, an admission of liability, and that a default judgment may
      be rendered.
        b. Conduct of Hearings. 1. Every hearing for  the  adjudication  of  a
      charge  of  parking  violation  shall  be  held  before a senior hearing
      examiner or a hearing examiner in accordance with rules and  regulations

      request of the person charged, issue a subpoena to compel the appearance
      at  a  hearing  of  the officer who served the notice of violation or of
      other persons to give testimony, and may issue a subpoena duces tecum to
      compel the production for examination or introduction into evidence,  of
      any book, paper or other thing relevant to the charges.
        5.  In  the  case of a refusal to obey a subpoena, the bureau may make
      application to  the  supreme  court  pursuant  to  section  twenty-three
      hundred  eight  of  the  civil  practice  law  and  rules,  for an order
      requiring such apppearance, testimony or production of evidence.

Section 19-207
--------------

Section 19-207 ::    
        
     
        §  19-207 Judgments. a. The hearing officer shall make a determination
      on the charges, either sustaining or dismissing them. Where the  hearing
      officer  determines  that  the charges have been sustained he or she may
      examine the parking violations record of the  person  charged  prior  to
      rendering  a  judgment. Judgments sustaining or dismissing charges shall
      be entered on a judgment roll maintained by  the  bureau  together  with
      records  showing  payment  and non-payment of penalties. No penalties or
      fees for late payment of a sustained charge shall  be  assessed  by  the
      bureau  until  at  least thirty days have elapsed from the issuance of a
      notice of determination. If a person files an  appeal  pursuant  to  the
      rules  of  the  bureau,  no  penalties  or  fees  for  late payment of a
      sustained charge shall be assessed by the bureau until at  least  thirty
      days  have elapsed from the issuance of a notice of determination of the
      appeal.
        b. Where an operator or owner fails to enter a plea  to  a  charge  of
      parking  violation  or  fails  to appear on a designated hearing date or
      subsequent adjourned date, as prescribed by this chapter or by  rule  or
      regulation  of  the  bureau, such failure to plead or to appear shall be
      deemed, for all purposes, an admission of liability and shall be grounds
      for rendering and  entering  a  default  judgment.  However,  after  the
      expiration  of  the  time  prescribed  for  entering a plea or making an
      appearance, and before such default judgment may be rendered, the bureau
      shall notify such operator  or  owner,  by  ordinary  mail  (1)  of  the
      violation  charge, (2) of the impending default judgment, and (3) that a
      default may be avoided by entering a plea or making an appearance within
      thirty days of the sending of such notice. Pleas entered or  appearances
      made  within that period shall be in the manner prescribed in the notice
      and not subject to additional penalty or fee. Such notice  of  impending
      default  judgment shall not be required prior to the rendering and entry
      thereof in the case of operators or owners who are non-residents of  the
      state  of  New York. In no case shall a default judgment be rendered or,
      where required, a notice of impending default  judgment  be  sent,  more
      than  two years after the expiration of the time prescribed for entering
      a plea or making an appearance.

      examiners, as the director shall determine.
        b. An appeal from a judgment of any hearing officer shall be submitted
      to the appeals board, which shall have power to review the facts and the
      law, but shall not consider any evidence which was not presented to  the
      hearing  officer  and shall have power to reverse or modify any judgment
      appealed from for error of fact or law.
        c. A party aggrieved by the judgment of a hearing officer may obtain a
      review thereof by serving upon the bureau  within  thirty  days  of  the
      entry of such judgment, a notice of appeal setting forth the reasons why
      the judgment should be reversed or modified.
        d.  Appeals  shall  be  made  without  the appearance of the appellant
      unless requested by the appellant or the appeals board. Within ten  days
      after  a  request for an appearance, made by the appellant or the board,
      the  bureau  shall  advise  the  appellant,  either  personally  or   by
      registered  or  certified mail, return receipt requested, of the date on
      which he or she shall appear. The appellant shall be notified in writing
      of the decision of the appeals board.
        e. The service of a notice of appeal shall not stay the enforcement of
      a judgment appealed from unless the appellant shall have posted  a  bond
      in  the  amount of the judgment appealed from, at the time of, or before
      the service of such notice.

Section 19-210.
---------------

Section 19-210. ::    
        
     
        * §  19-210.  Owner  liability  for failure of operator to comply with
      traffic-control indications. (a) 1. Notwithstanding any other  provision
      of law, the parking violations bureau is hereby authorized and empowered
      to  establish a demonstration program imposing monetary liability on the
      owner of a vehicle for failure of an operator  thereof  to  comply  with
      traffic-control  indications  in  accordance with the provisions of this
      section.   The   department   of   transportation,   for   purposes   of
      implementation  of  such  program,  shall  be  authorized to install and
      operate traffic-control signal photo violation-monitoring devices at  no
      more than one hundred fifty intersections at any one time.
        2.  Such demonstration program shall utilize necessary technologies to
      ensure, to the extent practicable, that  photographs  produced  by  such
      traffic-control  signal  photo  violation-monitoring  systems  shall not
      include images that identify the driver, the passengers, or the contents
      of the vehicle. Provided, however, that no notice  of  liability  issued
      pursuant  to this section shall be dismissed solely because a photograph
      or photographs allow  for  the  identification  of  the  contents  of  a
      vehicle,  provided that such city has made a reasonable effort to comply
      with the provisions of this paragraph.
        (b) 1. The owner of a vehicle shall be liable for  a  penalty  imposed
      pursuant  to  this section if such vehicle was used or operated with the
      permission of the owner, express or implied, in violation of subdivision
      (d) of section eleven hundred eleven of the vehicle and traffic law, and
      such  violation  is   evidenced   by   information   obtained   from   a
      traffic-control  signal  photo  violation-monitoring  system;  provided,
      however, that no owner of a  vehicle  shall  be  liable  for  a  penalty
      imposed  pursuant to this section where the operator of such vehicle has
      been convicted of the underlying violation of subdivision (d) of section
      eleven hundred eleven of the vehicle and traffic law.
        2. Notwithstanding any other provision of this section, no owner of  a
      vehicle  shall  be  subject  to a monetary fine imposed pursuant to this
      section if the operator of  such  vehicle  was  operating  such  vehicle
      without  the  consent  of  the owner at the time such operator failed to
      obey a traffic-control indication. For  purposes  of  this  subdivision,
      there  shall  be  a  presumption  that  the operator of such vehicle was
      operating such vehicle with the consent of the owner at  the  time  such
      operator failed to obey a traffic-control indication.
        (c)  For  purposes  of  this  section,  "owner" shall mean any person,
      corporation,  partnership,  firm,  agency,   association,   lessor,   or
      organization who at the time of the issuance of a notice of violation in
      which a vehicle is operated:
        (1) is the beneficial or equitable owner of such vehicle; or
        (2) has title to such vehicle; or
        (3)  is  the  registrant  or  co-registrant  of  such vehicle which is
      registered with the department of motor vehicles of this  state  or  any
      other state, territory, district, province nation or other jurisdiction;
      or
        (4)  uses such vehicle in its vehicle renting and/or leasing business;
      or
        (5) is an owner of such vehicle as  defined  by  section  one  hundred
      twenty-eight or subdivision (a) of section twenty-one hundred one of the
      vehicle and traffic law.
        (d)  For  purposes  of  this  section,  "traffic-control  signal photo
      violation-monitoring system" shall mean a device installed  to  work  in
      conjunction  with  a  traffic-control  signal  which,  during operation,
      automatically  produces  two  or   more   photographs,   two   or   more
      microphotographs,  a  videotape or other recorded images of each vehicle
    
      at the time it is used or operated in violation of  subdivision  (d)  of
      section eleven hundred eleven of the vehicle and traffic law.
        (e)  A  certificate,  sworn to or affirmed by a technician employed by
      the department,  or  a  facsimile  thereof,  based  upon  inspection  of
      photographs,   microphotographs,  videotape  or  other  recorded  images
      produced by a traffic-control signal photo violation-monitoring  system,
      shall  be  prima  facie  evidence  of  the  facts contained therein. Any
      photographs,  microphotographs,  videotape  or  other  recorded   images
      evidencing  such  a  violation  shall be available for inspection in any
      proceeding to  adjudicate  the  liability  for  such  violation  imposed
      pursuant to this section.
        (f)  An  owner  liable  for  a violation of subdivision (d) of section
      eleven hundred eleven of the vehicle and traffic law  pursuant  to  this
      section  shall  be  liable  for  monetary penalties in accordance with a
      schedule of fines and penalties to be promulgated by  such  bureau.  The
      liability  of  the owner pursuant to this section shall not exceed fifty
      dollars for each  violation;  provided  however  that  such  bureau  may
      provide  for  an additional penalty not in excess of twenty-five dollars
      for each violation for the failure to respond to a notice  of  liability
      within   the  prescribed  time  period.  Such  bureau  shall  adjudicate
      liability imposed by this section.
        (g) An imposition of liability under this section shall not be  deemed
      a  conviction as an operator and shall not be made part of the operating
      record of the person upon whom such liability is imposed nor shall it be
      used for insurance purposes in the provision of motor vehicle  insurance
      coverage.
        (h) 1. A notice of liability shall be sent by first class mail to each
      person  alleged  to be liable as an owner for a violation of subdivision
      (d) of section eleven hundred eleven of  the  vehicle  and  traffic  law
      pursuant  to  this  section.  Personal service on the owner shall not be
      required. A manual or  automatic  record  of  mailing  prepared  in  the
      ordinary  course  of business shall be prima facie evidence of the facts
      contained therein.
        2. A notice of liability shall contain the name  and  address  of  the
      person  alleged  to be liable as an owner for a violation of subdivision
      (d) of section eleven hundred eleven of  the  vehicle  and  traffic  law
      pursuant  to  this  section,  the  registration  number  of  the vehicle
      involved in such violation,  the  location  where  such  violation  took
      place, the date and time of such violation and the identification number
      of  the  camera  which  recorded the violation or other document locator
      number.
        3. The notice of liability  shall  contain  information  advising  the
      person charged of the manner and the time in which he or she may contest
      the liability alleged in the notice. Such notice of liability shall also
      contain  a warning to advise the persons charged that failure to contest
      in the manner  and  time  provided  shall  be  deemed  an  admission  of
      liability and that a default judgment may be entered thereon.
        4.  The notice of liability shall be prepared and mailed by the bureau
      or its designee.
        (i) If an owner receives  a  notice  of  liability  pursuant  to  this
      section for any time period during which the vehicle was reported to the
      police  department as having been stolen, it shall be a valid defense to
      an allegation of liability for a violation of subdivision (d) of section

      violation, the owner may maintain an action for indemnification  against
      the operator.

      paid  the  required  filing  fee  in  accordance  with the provisions of
      section two hundred thirty-nine of the vehicle and traffic law; and
        B. within thirty-seven days after receiving notice from the bureau  of
      the  date  and  time of a liability, together with the other information

      lease  or  other contract document, as may be reasonably required by the
      bureau pursuant to regulations that may be promulgated for such purpose.

      shall  be sent a notice of liability pursuant to subdivision (h) of this
      section.

      of  an  operator  of  a  vehicle for any violation of subdivision (d) of
      section eleven hundred eleven of the vehicle and traffic law.
