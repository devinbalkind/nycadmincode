Section 19-601 ::    
        
     
        §  19-601  Safety  measures on school buses; declaration and findings.
      The council hereby finds that a  serious  emergency  exists  as  to  the
      safety of handicapped children transported to and from schools in school
      buses   and  other  vehicles.  Handicapped  school  children  have  been
      grievously injured, maimed and killed due to  lack  of  seat  belts  and
      guards  or  escorts  on school buses. The council finds that in order to
      prevent  further  tragedies  to  our  handicapped  school  children  the
      provisions  of  this  section are declared necessary and are designed to
      protect, the safety, health and general welfare of our school children.

Section 19-605. ::    
        
     
        §  19-605.  Air-conditioning.  a.  Any  bus  or  other  motor  vehicle
      transporting a child with a disability to and from a school in the  city
      pursuant  to any agreement or contract shall be air-conditioned when the
      ambient outside temperature exceeds seventy degrees Fahrenheit.  Drivers
      of  all  such  vehicles  shall  utilize such air conditioning systems in
      order to make the internal  climate  of  such  vehicles  comfortable  to
      passengers  in  order  to protect or enhance the health of children with
      disabilities.   Any   failure,   mechanical   or   otherwise,   of    an
      air-conditioning  system  required by this section shall be repaired and
      restored to operable condition as soon as  is  practicable,  but  in  no
      event  more  than  three  business  days  subsequent to the failure. For
      purposes of this section, "child with a disability" shall mean  a  child
      with a disability as defined in section 4401(1) of the education law who
      requires an air-conditioned environment for health reasons.
        b.  The penalty provisions set forth in section 19-607 of this chapter
      shall not apply to any violation of the provisions of this section.  Any
      owner,  operator or contractor responsible for transporting a child with
      a disability to and from a school in the city pursuant to any  agreement
      or  contract shall be liable for a civil penalty of four hundred dollars
      for each violation of this section.

Section 19-606 ::    
        
     
        §  19-606 School bus service. a. Except as provided in subdivisions d,
      e and f of this section, no student shall be allowed to board  a  school
      bus  operated  by  or pursuant to a contract with the board of education
      unless a seat is available for the student.
        b. The board of education shall prepare and,  when  necessary,  revise
      two  school  bus  service  plans  annually  to  ensure that all students
      eligible to receive school bus service to  and  from  the  schools  they
      legally  attend  shall be provided with a seat on a school bus. One plan
      shall relate to school bus service to be provided during the session  of
      the  school  year beginning in September and ending in June and one plan
      shall relate to school bus service to be provided during a summer school
      session. Each plan shall be prepared prior  to  the  first  day  of  the
      session  of  the  school  year to which it relates and shall include the
      following information: (i) the criteria used by the board  of  education
      to  determine  whether  a  student  is  eligible  to  receive school bus
      service; (ii) for each school, a summary description of the  school  bus
      routes servicing the school; (iii) for each school bus route, the number
      of  students  eligible  to ride on the school bus operating on the route
      and the maximum seating capacity of such school bus; and (iv) any  other
      information  the  board  of education deems relevant. Upon completion of
      the plans, they shall be submitted to the mayor and the speaker  of  the
      city council.
        c.  If  at  any time during any session of a school year the number of
      students eligible to ride on a school  bus  operating  on  a  particular
      school  bus route exceeds the maximum seating capacity of the school bus
      operating on such  route,  the  board  of  education  shall  revise  the
      affected school bus service plan, and take all steps necessary to ensure
      that  all  students  eligible to receive school bus service are provided
      with a seat on a school bus. A revised plan shall identify  any  changes
      to  the information provided pursuant to paragraphs (i), (ii), (iii) and
      (iv) of subdivision b of this section and, in addition, shall  describe,
      for  each  school bus route affected by the revision, the steps taken to
      ensure that the number of students eligible to  ride  on  a  school  bus
      operating  on  a particular school bus route does not exceed the maximum
      seating capacity of  the  school  bus  operating  on  such  route.  Upon
      completion of a revised plan, it shall be submitted to the mayor and the
      speaker of the city council.
        d.  Not  later  than ten days prior to the first day of the session of
      the school year beginning in September, and  not  later  than  ten  days
      prior  to  the  first  day  of  a  summer  school  session, the board of
      education shall prepare, and provide to each bus company  that  will  be
      transporting  students  to or from school, lists of students eligible to
      ride on the school buses operating on the school bus routes serviced  by
      such  bus company. A separate list shall be compiled for each school bus
      route.  Each list shall identify each eligible student by  name,  school
      bus  stop  and  school,  but  shall  not  contain  any other information
      relating to such student. The board of education shall require that  bus
      companies  provide  to  bus drivers the list appropriate for each school
      bus route. The board of education shall prepare, and promptly provide to
      each bus company, revised and updated lists  that  reflect  any  changes
      necessary  to comply with the requirements of this section. All students
      listed as eligible to receive school bus service on a particular  school
      bus  route  shall  be entitled to board the school bus operating on such
      route. During transport to school at the beginning of the regular school
      day, students not listed as eligible to receive school bus service on  a
      particular school bus route shall not be allowed to board the school bus
      operating  on  such  route,  provided, however, that where such students
      waiting to board such school bus are not accompanied by  an  adult,  the
    
      bus  driver  shall  allow such students to board such school bus. During
      transport from school at the close of the regular school  day,  students
      not  listed  as  eligible  to receive school bus service on a particular
      school  bus route shall not be allowed to board the school bus operating
      on such route unless authorized to do so by personnel  assigned  by  the
      principal pursuant to subdivision e of this section.
        e.  The  principal  of  each  school  to  or  from  which students are
      transported by school bus shall assign  personnel  to  monitor  students
      exiting  school  buses  at  the  beginning of the regular school day and
      boarding school buses at the close  of  the  regular  school  day.  Such
      personnel  shall be provided with the same lists provided to bus drivers
      pursuant to subdivision d of this section. Such personnel shall: (i)  at
      the  close  of  the  regular  school  day,  determine whether to allow a
      student not listed as eligible  to  receive  school  bus  service  on  a
      particular  school  bus  route to board the school bus operating on such
      route; (ii) notify the parent or legal guardian of such student that  he
      or  she  has been or may be prohibited from boarding a school bus; (iii)
      provide the  parent  or  legal  guardian  with  the  name,  address  and
      telephone  number  of  the  office responsible for determining whether a
      student is eligible to receive school bus service; (iv) for each  school
      bus,  maintain  a  record of students not listed as eligible who exit or
      board the bus; and (v)  determine  whether  information  regarding  such
      students  should  be  referred to the office responsible for determining
      whether a student is eligible to receive school bus service  and,  where
      appropriate,  report  such  information  to such office. The information
      reported to such office, together with such other  relevant  information
      available  to the board of education, shall be considered in determining
      whether and how to revise the  affected  school  bus  service  plan  and
      revise  and  update  the  lists  of eligible students in accordance with
      subdivisions c and d of this section.
        f.  Notwithstanding  any  other  provision  of  this  section  to  the
      contrary,  during  the  first ten days of the session of the school year
      beginning in September and during the first ten days of a summer  school
      session,  a  student  waiting at a school bus stop to board a school bus
      transporting students to the school  attended  by  the  student  may  be
      allowed  to  board the school bus, whether or not such student is listed
      as eligible to receive school bus service on that school bus route  and,
      at  the  close  of  the  regular school day, may be allowed to board the
      school bus stopping at such school bus stop.
        g. The provisions of this section shall apply  only  to  those  school
      buses operated by or pursuant to a contract with the board of education.
