        6.  The registered owner or other person in control of a vehicle which
      has been removed pursuant to  this  section  shall  have  the  right  to

      no notice of violations shall be issued for violations of such temporary
      parking restrictions and that if an owner's  motor  vehicle  is  missing
      from the affected streets, the motor vehicle may have been towed and the
      motor  vehicle  owner  should  contact  the  local  police  precinct for
      information about the location of such motor vehicle.

      parking privileges or the temporary suspension of parking  restrictions,

      department or any applicable city agency to provide notice of  temporary
      parking restriction changes when required to preserve public safety.
