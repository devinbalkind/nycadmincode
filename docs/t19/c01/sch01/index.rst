      have  an  opportunity  to  be heard, in accordance with the rules of the
      department, within five days after such revocation.

      term  or  condition of a permit issued pursuant to such provision, which
      violation caused an imminent peril to life or property.
        g. The commissioner, consistent with  article  twenty-three-A  of  the
      correction  law,  may  refuse  to issue a permit if the applicant or any
      officer, principal, director or stockholder  of  such  applicant  owning
      more  than  ten  percent of the outstanding stock of the corporation has
      been convicted of a crime which in the judgment of the commissioner  has
    
      a  direct relationship to fitness or ability to perform the activity for
      which the permit is required.
        h.  1.  If  the  commissioner  finds that a permittee or any employee,
      agent, independent contractor or other person engaged in  performing  an
      activity  for  which  a permit has been issued has violated the terms or
      conditions of such permit or any provision  of  this  subchapter  or  of
      section 24-521 of the code relating to the activity for which the permit
      has  been  issued  or  any  order  issued  by or rule promulgated by the
      commissioner pursuant thereto or that a condition exists in  any  street
      which  is  in  violation of a provision of this subchapter or of section
      24-521 of the code or any order issued by or  rule  promulgated  by  the
      commissioner  pursuant  thereto,  unless  the  condition  is an imminent
      threat to life or safety, the commissioner may (i) notify the  permittee
      or  other  responsible person of the condition found by the commissioner
      to constitute such violation and request that action be taken to correct
      the condition in such a manner and within such period of time  as  shall
      be  set  forth  in such request, and (ii) afford such permittee or other
      responsible person an opportunity to contest the commissioner's  finding
      in  a  manner  to  be  set  forth  in  the  rules of the department. The
      commissioner may assess a fee for the  administrative  expense  and  the
      expense  of  additional  inspections which the department may incur as a
      result of such condition.
        2. The provisions of this subdivision shall not be construed to  limit
      the  power  of  the  commissioner  to  take  any other action authorized
      pursuant to this subchapter with respect to any violation, including but
      not limited to, the commencement of an action or proceeding in  a  court
      or  before  the  environmental  control  board  or  to  require that the
      commissioner resort to the procedure set forth in this subdivision as  a
      prerequisite  to  the commencement of an action or proceeding in a court
      or before the environmental control board or the  taking  of  any  other

Section 19-107 ::    
        
     
        § 19-107 Temporary  closing  of  streets.  a. (i)  Except as otherwise
      provided by law, it shall be  unlawful  for  any  person  to  close  any
      street,   or   a   portion  thereof,  within  the  jurisdiction  of  the
      commissioner, to pedestrian or vehicular traffic without a  permit  from
      the commissioner.
        (ii)  The  commissioner may temporarily close or may issue a permit to
      temporarily close to pedestrian or vehicular traffic any  street,  or  a
      portion  thereof,  within  his  or her jurisdiction, when, in his or her
      judgment,  travel  therein  is  deemed  to  be  dangerous  to  life,  in
      consequences of there being carried on in such street activities such as
      building  operations, repairs to street pavements, sewer connections, or
      blasting for the purpose of removing rock  from  abutting  property,  or
      upon   advice   from  the  police  commissioner,  fire  commissioner  or
      commissioner of the office of emergency  management  that  such  closure
      will  promote  or  protect  safety  or life, or when such closure may be
      necessary for a public purpose. In such event,  the  commissioner  shall
      make  available  to  the  community  board  and  council member in whose
      district such street is located information regarding any  such  closure
      which  continues  beyond five business days, state the reason or reasons
      for such closure and the estimated date for the street, or  any  portion
      thereof, to reopen.
        b.  In  the  event  that  a  publicly  mapped  street that is used for
      vehicular or vehicular and pedestrian access, for which vehicular access
      is fully closed for more than one hundred eighty consecutive  days,  the
      commissioner shall issue or cause to be issued a community reassessment,
      impact  and  amelioration (CRIA) statement that has been approved by the
      commissioner or other government entity initiating  the  street  closure
      which  shall  be  delivered  to both the community board and the council
      member in whose district the street is located  on  or  before  the  two
      hundred  tenth day of the closure. Such CRIA statement shall contain the
      following: the objectives  of  the  closure  and  the  reasons  why  the
      continued  street closure is necessary to attain those objectives, which
      in the case of a closure initiated by a local law enforcement agency for
      security reasons shall be satisfied by a statement from  the  local  law
      enforcement  agency  that  the  street  has  been closed and will remain
      closed for security  reasons;  identification  of  the  least  expensive
      alternative  means  of  attaining those objectives and the costs of such
      alternatives, or a statement and explanation as to the unavailability of
      such alternatives, which in the case of a closure initiated by  a  local
      law  enforcement  agency  for  security  reasons shall be satisfied by a
      statement from the law enforcement agency that there are no  alternative
      means available; how the continued street closure will impact access and
      traffic  flow to and within the surrounding community, including but not
      limited  to,  access  to  emergency  vehicles,  residences,  businesses,
      facilities,  paratransit transportation and school bus services; and any
      recommendations to mitigate adverse impact and increase  access  to  and
      within  the  area.  In  the  case  of  a  closure initiated for security
      reasons, the police department shall ensure that the CRIA statement does
      not  reveal  non-routine  investigative   techniques   or   confidential
      information  or  potentially  compromises  the  safety  of the public or
      police officers or  otherwise  potentially  compromise  law  enforcement
      investigations  or  operations,  provided  that the issuance of the CRIA
      statement shall not be delayed beyond  the  required  time  period.  The
      requirement  for  the  issuance of a CRIA statement as described in this
      subdivision may be satisfied by delivery of an environmental  assessment
      statement,  environmental impact statement, or similar document required
      by law to be prepared in relation to the street closure.  Prior  to  the
      issuance of a CRIA statement, the commissioner, in the case of a closure
    
      for  which  a permit issued by the department is required, shall hold at
      least one public forum, publicized in advance, in any affected community
      at which the community may register its input concerning  any  potential
      adverse  impacts  of  the  street  closure, including but not limited to
      concerns regarding timeliness of emergency vehicle response and  traffic
      congestion  resulting  in  a  potential  increase in noise and any other
      adverse conditions caused by the  closure.  In  the  case  of  a  street
      closure  effectuated  for  security  reasons  by a local law enforcement
      agency, such law enforcement agency shall hold the public forum provided
      herein. Following the public  forum(s),  the  council  member  in  whose
      district  the  street  closure  is located may forward to the government
      entity which held the  public  forum(s)  issues  raised  at  the  public
      forum(s)  by  the  participants.  The  government  entity which held the
      public forum(s) shall make its best efforts to  respond  to  the  issues
      raised,  utilizing  the expertise of other city agencies if appropriate,
      and shall provide such response to be appended to the CRIA statement. In
      the case  that  an  environmental  assessment  statement,  environmental
      impact statement, or similar document is substituted in lieu of the CRIA
      statement,  as  provided for above, the public forum provisions provided
      herein shall still apply.
        c. For purposes of this section, a "street closure" shall not  include
      a street closure undertaken by a federal or state governmental entity.

Section 19-112 ::    
        
     
        §  19-112  Ramps on curbs. In the construction and installation of all
      new and reconstructed curbs at corner located street  intersections  and
      pedestrian  crosswalks  not  located  at street intersections, provision
      shall be made for the  installation  of  the  following:  two  ramps  at
      corners  located  at  street  intersections  and  one ramp at pedestrian
      crosswalks not located at street intersections. Such ramps shall  be  no
      less  than  four  feet  wide  and shall blend to a common level with the
      roadway. If a common level is unobtainable, then the lip of  such  ramps
      shall  not  exceed a maximum of five-eighths of an inch and shall have a
      rounded edge. The slope of such ramp shall not exceed  eight  per  cent.
      This  section  shall  apply  to all construction of new curbs and to all
      replacement of existing curbs. The commissioner shall have discretion to
      waive one of the two  mandatory  ramps  at  corners  located  at  street
      intersections  where  any  of  the following obstacles exists preventing
      construction of such ramp within an intersection: fire  hydrants,  light
      poles,  traffic  signals,  fire  alarms, or free-standing police alarms,
      underground  vaults,  tunnels,  utility  maintenance  holes  (manholes),
      chambers  or where the gradient of the street on which the ramp is to be
      located or an  intersecting  street  exceeds  a  gradient  of  1:8.  The
      commissioner  may  waive  the  construction of both such ramps where the
      existence of underground  vaults,  tunnels,  utility  maintenance  holes
      (manholes)  and  chambers  would either prevent the safe construction of
      such ramps or render impossible the construction of such ramps to proper
      specifications without removal  of  said  underground  installations.  A
      certification  to  such  effect  shall  be  made part of the engineering
      design documents for such construction, and  a  copy  thereof  shall  be
      filed with the city clerk. Curbs for non-pedestrian routes, such as, but
      not  limited  to,  service  paths for highways and pedestrian restricted
      traffic islands shall not be subject to the provisions of this section.

      any person to erect or build, or cause or permit any vault  to  be  made
      without a license issued by the commissioner pursuant to this section or
      a  revocable  consent issued pursuant to chapter fourteen of the charter
      and the rules adopted by the commissioner pursuant thereto.  All  vaults
      shall  be  constructed in accordance with the provisions of the building
      code of the city of New York. A license issued pursuant to this  section
      shall  not  authorize  the construction of a vault which extends further
      than the line of the sidewalk or curbstone of any street.
        b. Licenses. Every application for a license to erect a vault shall be
      in writing, signed by the person making the same, and  shall  state  the
      intended length and width of such vault and the number of square feet of
      ground which is required therefor.
        c.  Compensation.  Upon  receiving such license the applicant therefor
      shall forthwith pay to the commissioner such  sum  as  the  commissioner
      shall  certify  in the license to be a just compensation to the city for
      such privilege, calculated at the rate of not less  than  thirty  cents,
      nor  more  than  two  dollars,  per foot, for each square foot of ground
      mentioned as required for such vault.
        d. Measurement. In the case of a new  vault,  before  the  arching  or
      covering  thereof shall be commenced, the person to whom the license for
      such vault shall have been granted shall cause the same to  be  measured
      by  a  city surveyor. Such surveyor shall deliver to the commissioner, a
      certificate, signed by the surveyor, specifying the  dimensions  of  the
      vault.  The  certificate  shall  be accompanied by a diagram showing the
      square foot area of the  vault,  including  its  sustaining  walls,  and
      indicating  its  location relative to the building and curb lines and to
      the nearest intersecting street corner.  In  the  case  of  an  existing
      vault,  the person claiming the right to the use thereof shall furnish a
      like certificate and diagram in respect thereof, but in  such  case  the
      measurement shall exclude the sustaining walls.
        e.  Refunds.  If,  from  subsequent measurements, it shall appear that
      less space has been taken than that paid  for,  the  licensee  shall  be
      entitled  to  receive  a  certificate  from the commissioner showing the
      difference.  Upon the presentation of such certificate of difference  to
      the comptroller, the comptroller shall pay a rebate to the licensee, the
      amount  of  which shall be the difference in money between the space fee
      originally paid and the fee for space actually taken.
        f. Unauthorized encroachments. If it shall appear that  the  vault  or
      cistern occupies a greater number of square feet than shall have been so
      paid  for,  the  owner thereof shall, in addition to the penalty imposed
      for such  violation  pursuant  to  section  19-149  or  19-150  of  this
      subchapter,  forfeit  and  pay  twice  the  sum previously paid for each
      square foot of ground occupied by the vault over and above the number of
      square feet paid for as aforesaid.
        g. Responsibility. The master builder who shall complete or begin  the
      construction of a vault, and the owner or person for whom the same shall
      be  excavated  or  constructed  shall  be  subject to the provisions and
      payments of this section and sections 19-118, 19-119, and 19-120 of this
      subchapter and to the penalties for violations  thereof,  severally  and
      respectively.
        h.  Exemption.  Openings  over  which  substantial  and securely fixed
      gratings of metal or other noncombustible material have been erected  in
      accordance  with  the  provisions  of  this section and sections 19-118,
      19-119 and 19-120 of this subchapter, shall be exempted from payment  of
      fees  for  licenses for vaults, provided such openings be used primarily
      for light and ventilation, and provided such gratings are of  sufficient
    
      strength  to sustain a live load of three hundred pounds per square foot
      and are constructed with at least forty percent of open work.

      filed  trade  name  tending  to advertise the business conducted in such
      premises.
        f. Obstructing of egress prohibited. No part of any  canopy  shall  be
      located  beneath a fire escape or so located as to obstruct operation of
      fire escape drop ladders or counter-balanced stairs or so as to obstruct
      any exit from a building.
        g. Violations. The owner or agent  of  any  building  and  the  owner,

      maintained shall be liable for a violation of this section.
        h.  Rules.  The commissioner may, except as otherwise provided by law,
      make rules for the design,  construction  and  maintenance  of  canopies

      and convenience of the public.
    
        i. Removal of unauthorized canopies. 1. Notwithstanding any  provision
      of  law  the  commissioner  may  serve  an  order  upon the owner of any
      premises requiring such owner to remove or to cause to  be  removed  any
      unauthorized  canopy  fastened  to  or  erected  in  front of his or her
      building,  within  a  period  to  be  designated in such order. Upon the
      owner's failure to comply  with  such  order  as  and  within  the  time
      specified  therein,  the  department may remove such canopy or cause the
      same to be removed, the cost of which shall be due and payable and shall
      constitute a lien against the premises  to  which  such  canopy  may  be
      attached  or in front of which it may be erected when the amount thereof
      shall have been definitely computed by such department and an  entry  of
      the  amount  thereof  shall  have been entered in the office of the city
      collector in the book in which such charges against the premises are  to
      be  entered.  A notice thereof, stating the amount due and the nature of
      the charge shall be mailed by the city collector, within five days after
      such entry, to the last known address of the person whose  name  appears
      on the records in the office of the city collector as being the owner or
      agent  or as the person designated by the owner to receive tax bills, or
      where no name appears, to the premises addressed to either the owner  or
      the  agent.  If such charge is not paid within ninety days from the date
      of entry, it shall be the duty of the  city  collector  to  collect  and
      receive  interest  thereon  at  the  rate  that would be applicable to a
      delinquent tax on such property, to be calculated to the date of payment
      from the date of entry. Such  charge  and  the  interest  thereon  shall
      continue  to  be,  until  paid,  a lien on the premises. Such charge and
      interest shall be collected and the lien thereof may  be  foreclosed  in
      the  manner  provided  by  law for the collection and foreclosure of the
      lien of such taxes, sewer rents, sewer surcharges and  water  rents  due
      and  payable  to  the  city, and the provisions of law applicable to the
      collection and foreclosure of the lien of such taxes, sewer rents, sewer
      surcharges and water rents shall apply to such charge and  the  interest
      thereon and the lien thereof.
        2.  Service  of  an  order upon an owner pursuant to the provisions of
      this section shall be made personally upon such owner  or  by  certified
      mail  addressed  to  the  last  known  address  of the person whose name
      appears upon the records in the office of the city  collector  as  being
      the owner of the premises or as the agent of such owner or as the person
      designated  by  the  owner  to receive the tax bills or, if no such name
      appears, at the address set forth as the address of  the  owner  in  the
      last  recorded  deed with respect to such premises. A copy of such order
      shall also be filed in the clerk's  office  of  each  county  where  the
      property is situated and posted in a conspicuous place on the premises.

      newsracks;   and  representing  that  such  newsracks  comply  with  the
      provisions of this section.
        (b) Any other owner or person in control of a newsrack shall, prior to
      placing or installing  such  newsrack  on  a  sidewalk,  submit  to  the
      commissioner  a form providing the information in clauses (ii) and (iii)
      of subparagraph (a) of this paragraph.
        2. Subsequent to the initial notification requirements  set  forth  in
      paragraph one of this subdivision, the owner or person in control of any
      newsrack  shall  submit  the  information set forth in subparagraph a of
      such paragraph once a year to the  commissioner  in  accordance  with  a
      notification schedule to be established by the commissioner. However, if
      the  number  of  newsracks  owned  or controlled by such owner or person
      increases or decreases by ten percent or more of the number of newsracks
      that have been included in the most recent notification required  to  be
      submitted  by  such  owner or person, such owner or person shall also be
      required to submit the information set forth in  such  paragraph  within
      seven  days  of  such  change, and provided, further, that such owner or
      person shall advise the department of any change in his or her  name  or
      address within seven days of such change.
        3. Notification to the city, as required by paragraphs 1 and 2 of this
      subdivision, may be submitted to the department electronically.
        d.  Indemnification and insurance. 1. Each person who owns or controls
      a newsrack placed or installed on any sidewalk shall indemnify and  hold
      the  city  harmless  from  any and all losses, costs, damages, expenses,
      claims, judgments or liabilities that the city may incur  by  reason  of
      the  placement,  installation or maintenance of such newsrack, except to
      the extent such damage results from the negligence or intentional act of
      the city.
        2. Each person who owns or controls a newsrack on any  sidewalk  shall
      maintain  a  general  liability  insurance policy naming the city of New
      York, and its departments, boards, officers,  employees  and  agents  as
      additional insureds for the specific purpose of indemnifying and holding
      harmless  those additional insureds from and against any and all losses,
      costs, damages, expenses, claims, judgments or liabilities  that  result
      from  or arise out of the placement, installation and/or the maintenance
    
      of any newsrack. The minimum limits of such insurance coverage shall  be
      no  less  than  three hundred thousand dollars combined single limit for
      bodily injury, including death, and property  damage,  except  that  any
      person  who maintains an average of one hundred or more newsracks at any
      one time shall maintain such minimum insurance coverage of  one  million
      dollars.  An  insurance  certificate  demonstrating  compliance with the
      requirements of this subdivision shall be submitted annually by December
      31st to the commissioner by the person who owns or controls such insured
      newsracks. Should said policy be called upon to  satisfy  any  liability
      for  damages covered by said policy, the policy must be of such a nature
      that the original amount of coverage is restored after  any  payment  of
      damages  under  the policy. Failure to maintain a satisfactory insurance
      policy pursuant to this subdivision  or  failure  to  submit  an  annual
      insurance  certificate to the commissioner pursuant to this subdivision,
      shall be deemed a violation of this section subject to subparagraph  b-1
      of paragraph one of subdivision f of this section.
        e.  Maintenance, continuous use, repair and removal. 1. Any person who
      owns or is in control of a newsrack shall certify once every four months
      to the commissioner on forms prescribed by the  commissioner  that  each
      newsrack  under  his  or her ownership or control has been repainted, or
      that  best  efforts  have  been  made  to  remove  graffiti  and   other
      unauthorized   writing,   painting,   drawing,   or  other  markings  or
      inscriptions at least once during the immediately preceding  four  month
      period.  Such  person shall maintain a log in which the measures and the
      dates and times when they are taken are recorded in  accordance  with  a
      format  approved  or  set  forth  by the commissioner. Such person shall
      maintain records for a period of three  years  documenting  the  use  of
      materials,  employees,  contractors,  other  resources  and expenditures
      utilized for the purpose of demonstrating the repainting or best efforts
      of such person to remove such graffiti or  other  unauthorized  writing,
      painting, drawing, or other markings or inscriptions. Such person shall,
      solely  for  the  purposes  of  complying  with  the  provisions of this
      paragraph, make such log and such records, and only such  log  and  such
      records,  available  to the department for inspection and copying during
      normal and regular business  hours  and  shall  deliver  copies  to  the
      department  upon  its  request. Such inspection may only be conducted by
      the  department  once  per  certification  period.  If  the   department
      determines  that  such  certification, log and records do not accurately
      demonstrate that an owner  or  person  in  control  of  a  newsrack  has
      repainted  or  used  best  efforts for such purposes as required by this
      paragraph, or upon a determination by the department that  an  owner  or
      such person failed to comply with any other provision of this paragraph,
      the  department  shall  issue  a  notice of violation in accordance with
      subparagraph b-1 of paragraph one of subdivision f of this section.
        2. Any person who owns or is in control of a newsrack shall  use  best
      efforts  to  ensure  that  each  newsrack  under his or her ownership or
      control is not used as a depository for  the  placement  of  refuse  and
      shall  be  required  to  remove  any  refuse placed within such newsrack
      within forty-eight hours of receipt of a notice of correction  from  the
      commissioner   as  provided  in  subparagraph  a  of  paragraph  one  of
      subdivision f of this section regarding such condition.
        3. In no event shall the owner or person in control of a newsrack fail
      to keep such newsrack supplied with written matter for a period of  more
      than  seven  consecutive days without securing the door so as to prevent
      the deposit of refuse therein. In no event shall  such  newsrack  remain
      empty for a period of more than thirty consecutive days.
        4. Any newsrack that has been damaged or is in need of repair shall be
      repaired,  replaced or removed by the owner or person in control of such
    
      newsrack within seven business days of receipt of a notice of correction
      from the commissioner as provided in subparagraph a of paragraph one  of
      subdivision  f of this section regarding such damage or need for repair.
      If  such newsrack has been damaged, or if it is in a state of disrepair,
      such that it constitutes a danger to persons or property,  it  shall  be
      made safe within a reasonable time following receipt of such a notice of
      correction from the commissioner regarding such condition.
        5.   Any  damage  to  city  property  resulting  from  the  placement,
      installation, maintenance or removal of a  newsrack  shall  be  repaired
      promptly  by  the  owner  or  person  in  control of such newsrack. If a
      newsrack is removed from its location on a sidewalk, the owner or person
      in control of such newsrack  shall  be  responsible  for  restoring  the
      sidewalk  and any other affected city property to the condition existing
      prior to installation of that newsrack.
        f. Enforcement. 1. (a)  Whenever  any  newsrack  is  found  to  be  in
      violation  of  any  provision  of  subdivision  b  of  this  section  or
      paragraphs two, three, four or five of subdivision e  of  this  section,
      the  commissioner shall issue a notice of correction specifying the date
      and nature of the violation and  shall  send  written  notification,  by
      regular  mail,  to  the  owner  or person in control of the newsrack. In
      addition, the commissioner may send a copy of such notice of  correction
      to  a  person designated by such owner or person to receive such notice,
      and/or the commissioner may send such notice by electronic mail to  such
      owner  or  such  person specifying the date and nature of the violation.
      However, failure to send a copy by regular or electronic mail  will  not
      extend  the  time  period  within  which  such  owner or other person is
      required by any provision of this section to take action, nor will  such
      failure result in the dismissal of a notice of violation issued pursuant
      to   any  provision  of  this  section.  The  commissioner  shall  cause
      photographic evidence of such violation to be taken. Such evidence shall
      be sent by regular mail together with the notice of  correction.  Except
      as  otherwise  provided  for  the  removal of refuse in paragraph two of
      subdivision e of this section, such person shall within  seven  business
      days from the date of receipt of notification via regular mail cause the
      violation to be corrected. For the purposes of this section, a notice of
      correction shall be deemed to have been received five days from the date
      on which it was mailed by the commissioner.
        (b)  If  an  owner  or  other person in control of a newsrack fails to
      comply with a notice of correction issued pursuant to subparagraph a  of
      this paragraph or an order by the commissioner to remove served pursuant
      to paragraph three of this subdivision, a notice of violation returnable
      to  the board shall be served on such owner or person in control of such
      newsrack. No notice of violation shall be  issued  for  the  failure  to
      comply  with a notice of correction issued pursuant to subparagraph a of
      paragraph one of this subdivision unless the commissioner has  caused  a
      second inspection of the violation to take place within a period of time
      that  commences  on  the  day after the applicable period for correcting
      such violation expires  and  ends  fourteen  days  after  such  day.  In
      addition,  the  commissioner  may  send to such owner or other person in
      control of such newsrack, by electronic mail, photographic  evidence  of
      such  violation  taken  at  such second inspection. Failure to send such
      photographic  evidence  by  electronic  mail  will  not  result  in  the
      dismissal  of  a notice of violation issued pursuant to any provision of
      this section.
        (b-1) Failure by an owner or a person in  control  of  a  newsrack  to
      comply with subdivision c or d of this section, failure by such owner or
      person  to  certify or failure to accurately demonstrate that such owner
      or person has repainted or used best  efforts  to  remove  graffiti  and
    
      other  unauthorized  writing,  painting,  drawing,  or other markings or
      inscriptions, as required by paragraph one  of  subdivision  e  of  this
      section,  shall  be  a  violation and shall be subject to the applicable
      penalties provided in paragraph six of this subdivision. A proceeding to
      recover  any  civil  penalty  authorized  by  this subparagraph shall be
      commenced with service on such owner or person of a notice of  violation
      returnable to the board. The commissioner shall not be required to issue
      a  notice  of correction before issuing or serving a notice of violation
      pursuant to this subparagraph.
        (c) If the return date of a notice of  violation  issued  pursuant  to
      subparagraph  b or b-1 of this paragraph is more than five business days
      after the service of such notice, the board shall, upon the  request  of
      the  respondent, in person at the office of the board, provide a hearing
      on such violation prior to such return  date  and  no  later  than  five
      business  days  after the date of such request. At the time set for such
      hearing, or at the date to which such hearing is  continued,  the  board
      shall  receive all evidence relevant to the occurrence or non-occurrence
      of the specified violation(s), the compliance or noncompliance with  any
      of  the  provisions of this section, and any other relevant information.
      Such hearing need not be conducted according to technical rules relating
      to evidence and witnesses. Oral evidence shall be taken only on oath  or
      affirmation.  Within  five  business  days  after  the conclusion of the
      hearing, the board shall render a decision, based upon the facts adduced
      at said hearing, whether any violations of this section  have  occurred.
      The  decision shall be in writing and shall contain findings of fact and
      a determination of the issues presented. The board  shall  send  to  the
      owner  or  person  in control of the newsrack by regular mail, a copy of
      its decision and order.
        2. (a) If the board renders a decision  upholding  the  finding  of  a
      violation  against  the  respondent upon default or after a hearing held
      pursuant to paragraph one of this subdivision,  other  than  a  decision
      finding  a violation of the provisions of paragraph one of subdivision e
      of this section, and the violation is not remedied within seven days  of
      receipt  of  the  decision  of the board, the commissioner or his or her
      designee is authorized to provide for the removal of such  newsrack  and
      any  contents  thereof  to  a  place  of  safety.  For  purposes of this
      subparagraph, a decision shall be deemed to have been received five days
      from the date on which it was mailed. If such newsrack and any  contents
      thereof  are  not  claimed  within  thirty days after their removal by a
      person entitled to their return, they shall be deemed  to  be  abandoned
      and  may be either sold at a public auction after having been advertised
      in the City Record, the proceeds thereof being  paid  into  the  general
      fund,  used  or  converted  for  use  by  the department or another city
      agency, or otherwise disposed of, and the owner  or  person  in  control
      shall  be  liable  to  the City for the costs of removal and storage and
      shall be subject to a  civil  penalty  pursuant  to  subparagraph  a  of
      paragraph  six  of  subdivision  f  of  this  section. Newsracks and the
      contents thereof that are removed pursuant to this subparagraph shall be
      released to the owner or other person lawfully  entitled  to  possession
      upon  payment of the costs for removal and storage and any civil penalty
      or, if an action or proceeding concerning the violation is pending, upon
      the posting of a bond or  other  form  of  security  acceptable  to  the
      department  in  an amount that will secure the payment of such costs and
      any penalty that may be imposed hereunder.
        (b) If the board  renders  a  decision  upholding  the  finding  of  a
      violation against the respondent for having failed to certify, or having
      failed  to accurately demonstrate that such respondent repainted or used
      best  efforts  to  remove  graffiti  and  other  unauthorized   writing,
    
      painting, drawing, or other markings or inscriptions or having failed to
      comply  with  any  other  provision of paragraph one of subdivision e of
      this section, the board  shall  impose  a  penalty  in  accordance  with
      subparagraph b of paragraph six of this subdivision.
        3. The commissioner may, upon notice, serve an order upon the owner or
      other person in control of a newsrack requiring such person to remove or
      cause  to be removed such newsrack within seven business days of receipt
      of such order where  such  removal  is  required  because  the  site  or
      location  at  which such newsrack is placed is used or is to be used for
      public  utility  purposes,  public  transportation,  or  public   safety
      purposes,   or   when   such   newsrack   unreasonably  interferes  with
      construction activities in nearby or adjacent buildings, or  if  removal
      is  required  in  connection  with  a  street  widening or other capital
      project or improvement. If such person does  not  remove  such  newsrack
      within  seven  business  days  of  receipt of such order, the provisions
      contained in subparagraphs b and c of paragraph one of this  subdivision
      and  subparagraph  a  of  paragraph  two  of  this subdivision regarding
      issuance of a notice of violation and alternatives for removal, storage,
      abandonment, disposal, and release, shall apply.
        4. Notwithstanding any other provision of law to the  contrary,  if  a
      newsrack  has been deemed to have been abandoned in accordance with this
      paragraph, the commissioner, his or her designee, an authorized  officer
      or  employee  of  any  city  agency or a police officer is authorized to
      provide for the removal of such newsrack and it may either  be  sold  at
      public  auction  after  having  been  advertised in the City Record, the
      proceeds thereof being paid into the general fund, used or converted for
      use by the department or another city agency, or otherwise disposed  of.
      A  newsrack  shall be deemed to have been abandoned for purposes of this
      paragraph if the name, address or  other  identifying  material  of  the
      owner or other person in control of such newsrack is not affixed to such
      newsrack  as required by paragraph four of subdivision b of this section
      and such owner or other person has not submitted to the commissioner the
      information required in clauses (ii) and  (iii)  of  subparagraph  a  of
      paragraph one of subdivision c of this section.
        5. (a) Where emergency circumstances exist and the commissioner or his
      or  her designee gives notice to the owner or other person in control of
      a newsrack to remove such newsrack, such person shall comply  with  such
      notice.  For  the  purposes  of  this paragraph, emergency circumstances
      shall mean circumstances which present  an  imminent  threat  to  public
      health or safety.
        (b)  If  any  owner  or other person in control of a newsrack does not
      remove such newsrack when directed to do so pursuant to  the  provisions
      of  subparagraph  a of this paragraph, or if circumstances are such that
      public safety requires the immediate removal of a newsrack and it is not
      reasonable to give the owner or other person in control of such newsrack
      notice prior to removal, the commissioner or his  or  her  designee  may
      provide for the removal of such newsrack to a place of safety. Unless an
      administrative  proceeding  brought  pursuant  to subparagraph c of this
      paragraph has terminated in favor of  such  owner  or  other  person  in
      control  of such newsrack, such owner or other person in control of such
      newsrack may be charged with the reasonable costs of removal and storage
      payable prior to the release of such newsrack and the contents thereof.
        (c) If an owner or other person in control  of  a  newsrack  fails  to
      comply with a notice issued pursuant to subparagraph a of this paragraph
      to  remove  such newsrack, a notice of violation returnable to the board
      shall be served on such owner or person in control of such newsrack.  If
      the  newsrack has been removed by the city pursuant to subparagraph b of
      this paragraph, such notice of violation  shall  be  served  immediately
    
      after  removal,  and,  if  the return date of the notice of violation is
      more than five business days after the service of such notice, the board
      shall, upon the request of the respondent, in person at  the  office  of
      the board, provide a hearing on such violation prior to such return date
      and no later than five business days after the date of such request. The
      hearing shall take place under the provisions set forth in subparagraphs
      b  and  c  of  paragraph one of this subdivision and a decision shall be
      rendered by the board within five business days after the conclusion  of
      the  hearing.  If  a decision is rendered at such hearing that emergency
      circumstances did not exist, such newsrack shall be returned within  ten
      days  to  the  location from which it was removed by the commissioner or
      his or her designee. If a decision is rendered  against  the  respondent
      upon  default  or  after  a  hearing  that  such emergency circumstances
      existed, such newsrack and the contents thereof shall be released to the
      owner or other person lawfully entitled to possession. If, after a board
      decision that removal was proper, such newsrack and any contents thereof
      are not claimed within thirty days after the date of removal by a person
      entitled to their return, such newsrack and any contents  thereof  shall
      be  deemed  abandoned  and  may be either sold at a public auction after
      having been advertised in the City Record, the  proceeds  thereof  being
      paid  into the general fund, used or converted for use by the department
      or another city agency, or otherwise disposed of.
        6. (a) Any owner or person in control of a newsrack  found  to  be  in
      violation of any provision of this section shall, after a board decision
      has  been  issued upon default or after a hearing, be subject to a civil
      penalty in the amount of (i) no less than fifty dollars and no more than
      one hundred dollars for each violation for a specific newsrack of any of
      the provisions of paragraphs two, three, four or five of  subdivision  e
      of  this  section  or  paragraph  four of subdivision b of this section,
      except that a person found in violation of any of such provisions  after
      a  decision of the board issued on default shall be subject to a penalty
      of no less than one hundred  dollars  and  no  more  than  five  hundred
      dollars;  (ii)  no  less than five hundred dollars and no more than four
      thousand dollars for each violation of paragraph one of subdivision c of
      this section; and (iii) no less than one hundred  dollars  and  no  more
      than  five  hundred  dollars  for each violation of paragraphs one, two,
      three, five, six and seven of subdivision b of this section.
        (b) Any owner or person in control of one or more newsracks  found  by
      the  board  to  have  failed to certify, or to have failed to accurately
      demonstrate that such owner or person repainted or used best efforts  to
      remove  graffiti  and  other unauthorized writing, painting, drawing, or
      other  markings  or  inscriptions,  as  required  by  paragraph  one  of
      subdivision  e  of  this  section,  or  failed  to comply with any other
      requirements of such paragraph, or failed to comply with  any  provision
      of paragraph two of subdivision c of this section, or failed to maintain
      insurance  as required by subdivision d of this section, shall be liable
      for a  civil  penalty  determined  in  accordance  with  the  number  of
      newsracks such person owns or controls as follows:
     
        Number of newsracks owned or     A violation of paragraph one of
        controlled by such person        subdivision e, paragraph two of
                                         subdivision c or subdivision d of
                                         this section
     
        Up to and including ninety-      Two hundred fifty to five
        nine newracks                    hundred dollars
     
        More than ninety-nine and less   Three hundred seventy-five to
    
        than two hundred fifty           seven hundred fifty dollars

        More than two hundred forty-     Seven hundred fifty to one
        nine and less than five hundred  thousand five hundred dollars
        newsracks
     
        More than four hundred ninety-   One thousand one hundred
        nine and less than seven         twenty-five to two thousand
        hundred fifty newsracks          two hundred fifty dollars
     
        More than seven hundred forty-   One thousand five hundred

                                         thousand dollars
     
        7.  The  commissioner  shall  remove  or  cause to be removed from any
      sidewalk for a period of three consecutive months,  every  newsrack  and
      the  contents  thereof  under the ownership or control of any person who
      repeatedly violates any provision or provisions of this subdivision. For
      purposes of this paragraph, a person shall be deemed to have  repeatedly
      violated  this  section if such person has been determined by the board,
      upon default or after a hearing, to have violated the provisions of this
      section ten or more times within any  six-month  period  and  that  such
      person  has  failed  to pay three or more civil penalties imposed during
      that same time period. For purposes of this paragraph,  a  person  shall
      also  be  deemed to have repeatedly violated this section if such person
      is determined by the board, upon default or after  a  hearing,  to  have
      failed   to   make  the  certification  required  by  paragraph  one  of

      markings  or  inscriptions  as required by such paragraph in each of two
      consecutive certification periods in any two year period or three  times
      in  any  two-year  period. The department shall maintain a record of all
      persons who repeatedly violate  any  provision  or  provisions  of  this
      subdivision.  In the event that the commissioner removes or causes to be
      removed all newsracks and the contents thereof under  the  ownership  or
      control  of  any  person based upon this paragraph, such person shall be
      permitted to replace all such newsracks at the locations from which they
      were removed upon payment in full of  all  outstanding  civil  penalties
      imposed  for  violations  of  this  section  and the reasonable costs of
      removal and storage, provided that such newsracks meet the  requirements
      of  this  section. If any newsracks or contents thereof removed pursuant
      to  this  paragraph  are  not  claimed  within  thirty  days  after  the
      expiration  of  the  three-month  removal  period, such newsracks or the
      contents thereof shall be deemed abandoned and may  be  either  sold  at
      public  auction  after  having  been  advertised in the City Record, the
      proceeds thereof being paid into the general fund, used or converted for
      use by the department or another city agency or otherwise disposed of.
        8. In giving any notice of correction  or  serving  any  commissioners
      order  required under this section, except as otherwise provided by law,
      the commissioner may rely on the validity of any address (a)  posted  on
      the newsrack pursuant to paragraph four of subdivision b of this section
      as  the address of the owner or person in control of the newsrack or (b)
      submitted to the department pursuant to subdivision c of  this  section,
    
      and  shall  provide  such  notice  by  regular  mail.  If the owner of a
      newsrack or person in control of a newsrack shall have failed to  comply
      with  paragraph  four  of  subdivision  b  or with subdivision c of this
      section, the commissioner shall make reasonable efforts to ascertain the
      identity  and address of the owner or person in control of such newsrack
      for the purpose of giving any required notice, and having done  so,  may
      take action as if any required notice had been given.
        9.  Nothing  in this section shall preclude the immediate removal of a
      newsrack when otherwise authorized by law.

        § 19-133 Removal of unauthorized projections and encroachments. a. The
      commissioner may serve an order upon the owner of any premises requiring
      such   owner   to   remove  or  alter  any  unauthorized  projection  or
      encroachment, on or in front of his premises,  within  a  period  to  be
      specified  in  such  order. Such order shall be served personally, or by
      leaving it at the house or place of business of the owner,  occupant  or
      person  having  charge  of  the  house  or  lot  in  front  of which the
      projection or encroachment may be, or by posting such order thereon.
        b. At any time after the expiration of the  time  specified  for  that
      purpose  in the order, if such encroachment or projection shall not then
      have been removed or altered, the commissioner may remove  or  alter  or
      cause  such  encroachment  or projection to be removed or altered at the
      expense of the owner or constructor thereof, who shall be liable to  the
      city  for  all expenses that it may incur by such removal or alteration,
      together with the  penalties  prescribed  by  this  subchapter  for  the
      violation of such order, to be recovered with costs of suit.
        c.  1.  In  addition to any other remedies or penalties, whenever such
      removal,  alteration,  repair  and  restoration  is  undertaken  by  the
      commissioner  he  or she may certify separately the costs and expense of
      such removal, alteration, repair and restoration to the commissioner  of
      finance.  The commissioner of finance shall, upon the certificate of the
      commissioner, charge the amount of such costs and expenses  against  the
      property  upon  and  with respect to which the work was performed. Every
      such charge shall be a lien upon the property or premises in respect  to
      which the same shall have been made, which lien shall have priority over
      all  other liens and incumbrances except taxes and assessments for other
      public or local improvements, sewer rents, water rents and  interest  or
      penalty  thereon  levied  or charged pursuant to law. Such lien shall be

      such removal, alteration, repair  and  restoration,  undertaken  by  the
      commissioner, as provided herein.

Section 19-133.1 ::    
        
     
        §  19-133.1  Unlawful  Sidewalk ATMs. a. For purposes of this section,
      "Automated Teller Machine Booth" ("ATM booth")  shall  mean  any  device
      linked to the accounts and records of a banking institution that enables
      consumers  to carry out banking transactions, including, but not limited
      to, account transfers, deposits, cash  withdrawals,  balance  inquiries,
      and loan payments.
        b.  Notwithstanding  any  other provision of law, it shall be unlawful
      for any property owner to permit an ATM  booth  to  be  located  on  any
      portion  of the sidewalk that is adjacent to the property of such owner,
      lies between the curb line and the building line, and  is  intended  for
      use by the public.
        c.  The  department  may serve an order upon the owner of any premises
      adjacent to which such ATM booth is located,  requiring  such  owner  to
      remove  such  ATM booth. The department shall provide in such order that
      such ATM booth shall be removed within thirty days of the date  of  such
      order.  Such  order  shall  be  served personally upon the owner of such
      premises, or by leaving it with a person in control of the premises,  or
      by leaving it or posting it at the place of business of the owner, or by
      leaving  it  or  posting it at any home of such owner, if service to the
      place of business of such owner is impractical.
        d. Failure to comply with an order  to  remove  an  ATM  booth  within
      thirty  days of the date of such order shall be a violation subject to a
      civil penalty of not less than two thousand  five  hundred  dollars  nor
      more than five thousand dollars for the first day of such violation. Any
      owner who remains in violation beyond the first day after the expiration
      of  the  thirty-day period specified in such order shall be subject to a
      civil penalty of five thousand dollars for every five-day period  during
      which  he  or  she  remains  in  violation.  There shall be a rebuttable
      presumption that the ATM booth has remained in place  during  each  such
      five-day period.
        e.  In  addition  to any other fines, penalties, sanctions or remedies
      provided for in this section, an ATM booth which remains in violation of
      subdivision d of this section shall be deemed abandoned. The  department
      shall  be authorized to provide for the seizure of such ATM booth, after
      the owner has been provided with notice and an opportunity to  be  heard
      before the appropriate administrative tribunal, if the owner of such ATM
      booth  has  accumulated  an aggregate of fifty thousand dollars in civil
      penalties that have  remained  unpaid  for  ninety  days  following  the
      expiration  of  the  time  to appeal the imposition of such penalties in
      accordance with the procedures of the environmental control board.

      include minor work which does not change surface drainage patterns.
        2. The term "clearing" means removing surface encumbrances from a land
      area,  including  but not limited to fences, trees, logs, stumps, brush,
      stones, vegetation and earth.
        3. The term "grubbing" means the removal of root systems  incident  to
      surface growths of trees and vegetation.
        4.  The  term  "grading" means leveling, sloping, raising, lowering or
      otherwise changing the existing surface of land area.
        5. The term "excavation" means removal of material, regardless of  its
      nature, from below the existing ground surface.
        6. The term "filling" means the deposition, levelling or compacting of
      organic  or  inorganic material at or in a vacant lot or land area for a
      purpose relating to the composition, contour, use, or  proposed  use  of
      the  land  or  for  the  purpose  of  disposing of material removed from
      another lot or land area.
        b. It shall be unlawful for any person to perform or  cause,  procure,
      suffer  or  permit  to  be  performed  any  land contour work, except as
      provided in subdivision c hereof, without  a  written  permit  from  the
      commissioner.
        c.  Subdivision  b  hereof  shall  not  apply: 1. To land contour work
      performed in connection with or in the course of the erection of one  or
      more  buildings  or  other  structures  or  in connection with land uses
      pursuant to a permit therefor issued by  the  department  of  buildings,
      provided however that, (a) such permit specifically authorizes such land
      contour  work,  and  (b)  such  land  contour work is performed entirely
      within the lot lines of the building  site  for  which  such  permit  is
      issued. In such cases where water courses, drainage ditches, conduits or
      other  means  of  carrying off water exist on the property and are to be
      altered or relocated, the commissioner of buildings shall  consult  with
      the  commissioner  of  environmental  protection concerning the means of
      disposal of surface water prior to issuance of a permit.
        2. to land contour work which consists only of making improvements  to
      a  land area on which a one or two-family house already exists and which
      does not result in any change in the surface runoff pattern of such land
      area.
        d. No condition shall be created or maintained as the result  of  land
      contour  work  that  will  interfere  with  existing  drainage  unless a
      substitute  therefor  is  provided  which   is   satisfactory   to   the
      commissioner   and  the  commissioner  of  environmental  protection  in
      accordance  with  criteria  established   by   such   commissioners   in
      consultation   with   the  department  of  health  and  mental  hygiene.
      Watercourses, drainage ditches, conduits and other like or unlike  means
      of  carrying  off  water  or  disposing  of  surface  water shall not be
      obstructed by refuse, waste, building  materials,  earth,  stones,  tree
      stumps,  branches  or by any other means that may interfere with surface
      drainage or cause the impoundment of surface  waters  either  within  or
      without  the  area  on  which contour work is performed. All excavations
      shall be drained and the drainage maintained as long as  the  excavation
      continues  or  remains.  Where  necessary,  pumping  shall be used. Fill
      material shall consist of inert, inorganic matter. It shall be  unlawful
      to  deposit  garbage,  waste  paper, lumber or other organic material in
      land fill. The provisions of this section shall not prevent placement of
      organic matter for fill by the department  of  sanitation  in  locations
      under  the  jurisdiction of such department. The commissioner shall have
      the power, in consultation with the commissioner of buildings  to  adopt
    
      rules  concerning the type of material that may be used for fill on land
      not mapped as park land. The commissioner shall enforce compliance  with
      the  provisions  hereof,  and  shall  make  immediate  complaint  to the
      corporation   counsel   of  any  violation  thereof.  In  addition,  the
      commissioner of buildings shall similarly enforce  compliance  with  the
      provisions  hereof  with  respect  to  any  land  contour work performed
      pursuant to a permit issued by the commissioner  of  buildings,  and  in
      addition  thereto  shall  inform the department of any failure to comply
      with  a  department  of  buildings  violation  order  relating  to   the
      provisions hereof.
        e.  1.  Whenever  the  department shall determine that a condition has
      been created, or has resulted by  reason  of  land  contour  work  which
      violates  any  provision  of  subdivision (d) hereof, the department may
      serve an order in  the  manner  prescribed  in  paragraph  two  of  this
      subdivision  upon  the  owners of the land upon which such condition has
      been created or has occurred, to correct such condition within the  time
      designated  in  such  order. Upon the owner's failure to comply with any
      order of the department as and within the time specified therein by such
      department, such department may perform such work or cause the  same  to
      be  performed,  the  cost  of  which  shall be due and payable and shall
      constitute a lien upon the land to which such order pertains,  when  the
      amount  thereof  shall have been finally computed by such department and
      an entry of the amount thereof shall have been entered in the office  of
      the  city  collector  in  the  book  in  which  such charges against the
      premises are to be entered. A notice thereof, stating the amount due and
      the nature of the charge shall be mailed by the city  collector,  within
      five  days  after  such  entry,  to the last known address of the person
      whose name appears on the records in the office of the city collector as
      being the owner or agent or as the person designated  by  the  owner  to
      receive  tax  bills, or where no name appears, to the premises addressed
      to either the owner or agent. If such charge is not paid  within  ninety
      days  from the date of entry, it shall be the duty of the city collector
      to collect and receive interest  thereon  at  the  rate  that  would  be
      applicable to a delinquent tax on such property, to be calculated to the
      date  of  payment  from  the date of entry. Such charge and the interest
      thereon shall continue to be, until paid, a  lien  on  the  premises  on
      which  such  work  was  performed.    Such  charge and interest shall be
      collected and the lien thereon may be foreclosed in the manner  provided
      by  law  for  the collection and foreclosure of the lien of taxes, sewer
      rents, sewer surcharges and water rents due and payable to the city, and
      the provisions of law applicable to the collection  and  foreclosure  of
      the  lien  of  such taxes, sewer rents, surcharges and water rents shall
      apply to such charge.
        The provisions of section 11-307 of the code applicable to the payment
      of assessments shall also  apply  to  charges  heretofore  or  hereafter
      established pursuant to this section.
        2.  Service  of  an  order upon an owner pursuant to the provisions of
      this section shall be made personally upon such owner  or  by  certified
      mail  addressed  to  the  last  known  address  of the person whose name
      appears upon the records in the office of the city  collector  as  being
      the owner of the premises or as the agent of such owner or as the person
      designated  by  the  owner  to receive the tax bills or, if no such name
      appears, to the address set forth as the address of  the  owner  in  the
      last  recorded  deed with respect to such premises. A copy of such order
      shall also be filed in the clerk's  office  of  each  county  where  the
      property  is  situated and shall be posted in a conspicuous place on the
      premises.

      commissioner,  he or she may cause an order to be served upon the person
      by whom such pavement was removed,  or  if  such  removal  was  for  the
      purpose  of  making  a  connection  between any house or lot, or for any
      sewer or pipes in the street, or for constructing vaults,  or  otherwise
      improving  any house or lot, upon the owner or occupant of such house or
      lot, requiring such person, or the owner or occupant of  such  house  or

      issue an order to cease and desist. Such order shall be given orally  or
      in writing to the persons executing the work and shall require immediate
      compliance therewith. The order may also require such persons to execute
      such  work  or  take  such  action as the commissioner determines may be
      necessary to remove the danger or otherwise make the  street  reasonably
      safe,  including  but  not  limited  to  filling  in  an  excavation and
      repairing, restoring or  replacing  the  pavement  thereon  or  removing
      construction material or equipment or dirt, debris or rubbish therefrom.
        e.  In  addition  to any other remedies or penalties set forth in this
      subchapter, upon the failure to comply  with  an  order  issued  by  the
      commissioner to remedy any condition on any street which is in violation
      of  this  subchapter, or of section 24-521 of the code, the rules of the
      department in relation thereto or the terms or conditions  of  a  permit
      issued  pursuant  to  this  subchapter,  including an order to cease and
      desist, within the time set forth in such order,  the  commissioner  may
      execute  the  work  required to be executed in such order. All costs and
      expenses of the city for such work may be recovered from the persons who
      are found to be liable for the violation. Before undertaking to  execute
      any  work  required by an order, other than work required by an order to
    
      cease and desist, the commissioner shall afford the persons to whom such
      order is directed an opportunity to be  heard  in  accordance  with  the
      rules of the department.
        f.  The provisions of sections 19-149 and 19-150 shall be construed to
      provide that a permittee or a person for whose benefit any activity  for
      which  a  permit  is  required  pursuant to this subchapter is performed
      shall  be  liable  with  his  or  her  employee,  agent  or  independent
      contractor  for  a  violation of the provisions of this subchapter or of
      section 24-521 of the code or any order issued by or rule promulgated by
      the commissioner pursuant thereto or the  terms  or  conditions  of  any
      permit  issued  pursuant  thereto  which  is committed by such employee,
      agent or independent contractor in the course of performing the activity
      for which a permit was issued to such permittee or  the  activity  which
      benefited  such  person. Notwithstanding the foregoing provision, in any
      action or proceeding against a person who owns or leases  real  property
      for a violation arising out of work in a street which benefited the real
      property  owned  or  leased  by  such person, it shall be an affirmative
      defense by such owner or lessee that the work which was the  subject  of
      such  violation was performed by a licensed master plumber as defined in
      subdivision e of section 26-141  of  the  administrative  code  under  a
      permit  issued  by  the  department  or by an operator of an underground
      facility as defined in 12 NYCRR 53-1.5.

Section 19-152 ::    
        
     
        §  19-152  Duties  and  obligations  of property owner with respect to
      sidewalks and lots. a. The owner of any real property, at his or her own
      cost and expense, shall (1) install, construct, repave, reconstruct  and
      repair  the  sidewalk  flags  in  front  of  or  abutting such property,
      including but not  limited  to  the  intersection  quadrant  for  corner
      property,  and  (2) fence any vacant lot or lots, fill any sunken lot or
      lots and/or cut down any raised lots comprising  part  or  all  of  such
      property  whenever  the commissioner of the department shall so order or
      direct.  The  commissioner  shall  so  order  or  direct  the  owner  to
      reinstall, construct, reconstruct, repave or repair a defective sidewalk
      flag in front of or abutting such property, including but not limited to
      the intersection quadrant for corner property or fence any vacant lot or
      lots,  fill  any  sunken  lot  or  lots  and/or cut down any raised lots
      comprising part or all of such property after an inspection of such real
      property by a departmental inspector. The commissioner shall not  direct
      the  owner  to  reinstall, reconstruct, repave or repair a sidewalk flag
      which was damaged by the city, its agents or any contractor employed  by
      the  city  during the course of a city capital construction project. The
      commissioner shall direct the owner to  install,  reinstall,  construct,
      reconstruct,  repave or repair only those sidewalk flags which contain a
      substantial defect. For the purposes of this subdivision, a  substantial
      defect shall include any of the following:
        1.  where  one or more sidewalk flags is missing or where the sidewalk
      was never built;
        2. one or more sidewalk flag(s) are cracked to such an extent that one
      or more pieces of the flag(s) may be loosened or readily removed;
        3. an undermined sidewalk flag below which there is a visible void  or
      a loose sidewalk flag that rocks or seesaws;
        4.  a  trip  hazard,  where  the  vertical  grade differential between
      adjacent sidewalk flags is greater than or equal to  one  half  inch  or
      where  a  sidewalk flag contains one or more surface defects of one inch
      or greater in all horizontal directions and is one half inch or more  in
      depth;
        5.  improper  slope,  which  shall mean (i) a flag that does not drain
      toward the curb and retains water, (ii) flag(s) that must be replaced to
      provide  for  adequate  drainage  or  (iii)  a  cross  slope   exceeding
      established standards;
        6.   hardware   defects   which  shall  mean  (i)  hardware  or  other
      appurtenances not flush within 1/2" of  the  sidewalk  surface  or  (ii)
      cellar  doors that deflect greater than one inch when walked on, are not
      skid resistant or are otherwise in a dangerous or unsafe condition;
        7. a defect involving structural integrity, which shall  mean  a  flag
      that  has  a  common  joint,  which  is  not  an expansion joint, with a
      defective flag and has a crack that meets  such  common  joint  and  one
      other joint;
        8.  non-compliance  with DOT specifications for sidewalk construction;
      and
        9. patchwork which shall mean (i) less than full-depth repairs to  all
      or  part  of  the  surface area of broken, cracked or chipped flag(s) or
      (ii) flag(s) which are partially or wholly constructed with  asphalt  or
      other unapproved non-concrete material; except that, patchwork resulting
      from  the  installation  of canopy poles, meters, light poles, signs and
      bus stop shelters shall  not  be  subject  to  the  provisions  of  this
      subdivision unless the patchwork constitutes a substantial defect as set
      forth in paragraphs (1) through (8) of this subdivision.
        a-1.  An  owner  of  real  property shall bear the cost for repairing,
      repaving, installing, reinstalling, constructing or  reconstructing  any
      sidewalk flag in front of or abutting his or her property, including but
    
      not  limited to the intersection quadrant for corner property, deemed to
      have a substantial defect which is discovered in the course  of  a  city
      capital  construction  project  or  pursuant  to  the department's prior
      notification  program, wherein the department receives notification of a
      defective sidewalk flag(s) by any member of the general public or by  an
      employee of the department. However, with respect to substantial defects
      identified pursuant to the prior notification program, the sidewalk must
      be  deemed  to  be a hazard prior to the issuance of a violation for any
      substantial defect contained in subdivision a of this  section  for  any
      sidewalk  flag  on  such  sidewalk.  For purposes of this subdivision, a
      hazard shall exist on any sidewalk where there is any of the following:
        1. one or more sidewalk flags is missing or  the  sidewalk  was  never
      built;
        2.  one or more sidewalk flag(s) is cracked to such an extent that one
      or more pieces of the flag(s) may be loosened or readily removed;
        3. an undermined sidewalk flag below which there is a visible void;
        4. a loose sidewalk flag that rocks or seesaws;
        5. a vertical  grade  differential  between  adjacent  sidewalk  flags
      greater than or equal to one half inch or a sidewalk flag which contains
      one  or  more  surface  defects of one inch or greater in all horizontal
      directions and is one half inch or more in depth; or
        6. cellar doors that deflect greater than one inch when walked on, are
      not skid resistant or are otherwise in a dangerous or unsafe condition.
        b. All such work shall be done in accordance with such  specifications
      and regulations prescribed by the department.
        c. Whenever the department shall determine that a sidewalk flag should
      be  installed,  constructed, reconstructed, or repaved, or that a vacant
      lot should be fenced, or a sunken lot filled or a raised lot  cut  down,
      it may order the owner of the property abutting on such sidewalk flag or
      the  owner  of  such vacant, sunken or raised lot by issuing a violation
      order to  perform  such  work.  Such  order  shall  provide  a  detailed
      explanation  of  the  inspection  and  the sidewalk defects according to
      sidewalk flags including a detailed diagram of the property and  defects
      by  type.  The order shall also inform the owner of the existence of the
      borough offices within the department together with  an  explanation  of
      the  procedures  utilized  by  the  borough  office  as  provided for in
      paragraph eighteen of subdivision a of section twenty-nine hundred three
      of the New York city charter as well as a complaint and appeal  process,
      including  the  right  to  request  a reinspection and then the right to
      appeal by filing a notice of claim with the office of the comptroller of
      the city of New York and thereafter a petition for appeal and commence a
      proceeding to review and/or correct the notice  of  account  and/or  the
      quality  of  the  work  performed  under  the  direction  of  or  by the
      department as provided herein and the procedures as to how to appeal  by
      filing  a notice of claim with the office of the comptroller of the city
      of New York and how to file a petition  and  commence  a  proceeding  to
      review  and/or  correct  the notice of account and/or the quality of the
      work performed as provided herein and the location where the  forms  may
      be  obtained.  Such  order  shall  specify  the work to be performed, an
      estimate of the cost of the work to repair the  defects  and  the  order
      shall  also  specify a reasonable time for compliance, provided that the
      time  for  compliance  shall  be  a  minimum  of  forty-five  days.  The
      department shall, by appropriate regulations, provide for a reinspection
      by  a different departmental inspector than the inspector that conducted
      the first or original inspection upon request of the property  owner  to
      the  appropriate borough office. Where appropriate, the department shall
      notify the property owner of the date of reinspection at least five days
      prior  to  the  reinspection  date.  Such   inspector   conducting   the
    
      reinspection  shall  conduct  an  independent inspection of the property
      without access to the reports from the first inspection.  The  inspector
      conducting  the  reinspection shall file a new report and the department
      shall  issue  a  new  order  to  the owner specifying the results of the
      reinspection with a detailed diagram of  the  property  and  defects  by
      type.  Such order shall also advise the owner of the procedures utilized
      by  the  borough  office  as  provided  for  in  paragraph  eighteen  of
      subdivision  a of section twenty-nine hundred three of the New York city
      charter and also of the right to challenge the notice of account  and/or
      the  quality  of the work performed by filing a notice of claim with the
      office of the comptroller and  thereafter  a  petition  and  commence  a
      proceeding  to  review  and/or  correct the notice of account and/or the
      quality of  the  work  performed  under  the  direction  of  or  by  the
      department as provided in sections 19-152.2 and 19-152.3 of the code and
      specify  the  procedures as to how to appeal by filing a notice of claim
      with the office of the comptroller of the city of New York  and  how  to
      file  a  petition and commence a proceeding to review and/or correct the
      notice of account and/or the quality  of  the  work  performed  and  the
      location where the forms may be obtained.
        d.  If the department has been notified in writing of the existence of
      a defective, unsafe, dangerous or obstructed  condition  of  a  sidewalk
      pursuant  to  subdivision  (c)  of  section  7-201  of the code, and the
      department determines  that  such  condition  constitutes  an  immediate
      danger  to  the  public,  it  may  notify  the  property owner that such
      condition constitutes an immediate danger to the public and direct  such
      owner to repair same within ten days of the service of the notice.
        e. Upon the owner's failure to comply with such order or notice within
      forty-five  days  of  service  and filing thereof, or within ten days if
      such period is fixed by the department pursuant to subdivision d of this
      section, the department may  perform  the  work  or  cause  same  to  be
      performed  under  the  supervision of the department, the cost of which,
      together  with   administrative   expenses,   as   determined   by   the
      commissioner,   but  not  to  exceed  twenty  percent  of  the  cost  of
      performance, shall constitute a debt recoverable from the owner by  lien
      on the property affected or otherwise. Upon entry by the city collector,
      in  the  book  in  which  such  charges are to be entered, of the amount
      definitely computed as a statement of account by  the  department,  such
      debt  shall  become  a  lien  prior to all liens or encumbrances on such
      property, other than taxes. An owner shall be deemed  to  have  complied
      with  this subdivision if he or she obtains a permit from the department
      to perform such work as specified in the order within the time set forth
      therein and completes such work within ten days thereafter.
        f. Service of a notice or  order  by  the  department  upon  an  owner
      pursuant to the provisions of this section shall be made upon such owner
      or  upon his or her designated managing agent personally or by certified
      or registered mail, return receipt requested, addressed  to  the  person
      whose  name  appears  on  the records of the city collector as being the
      owner of the premises. If the records of the city collector show that  a
      party,  other  than  the owner, has been designated to receive tax bills
      for such property, the notice shall be mailed to such party as  well  as
      to the owner of record, at his or her last known address, or, if it is a
      multiple  dwelling, service upon the owner or managing agent may be made
      in accordance with section 27-2095 of the code. If  the  postal  service
      returns  the  order  with  a  notation  that the owner refused to accept
      delivery of such notice, it may be served by ordinary mail and posted in
      a conspicuous place on the premises.
    
        g. A copy of such notice or order shall also be filed in the office of
      the clerk of each county where the property is situated,  together  with
      proof of service thereof.
        h.  Nothing  contained  in  this  section shall impair or diminish the
      power of the city to install, construct, reconstruct, repave  or  repair
      sidewalk  flags or to fence vacant lots or to fill sunken lots or to cut
      down raised lots or to enter into contracts with the owners of  premises
      abutting on streets for such installation, construction, reconstruction,
      repaving  or  repair  of  sidewalk  flags  or  fencing of vacant lots or
      filling of  sunken  lots,  or  cutting  down  of  any  raised  lots,  in
      accordance  with  the  rules  of the procurement policy board. Nor shall
      anything contained in this section affect or  impair  any  act  done  or
      right  accrued  or accruing, or acquired, or liability incurred prior to
      the effective date of this section, but  the  same  may  be  enjoyed  or
      asserted as fully and to the same extent as if this section had not been
      enacted.
        i.  After  the  work  has  been  performed  or after inspection by the
      department in the case where the work was performed under the  direction
      of  the  department a notice of such account, stating the amount due and
      the nature of the charge, shall be mailed by the city collector,  within
      five  days  after  such  entry,  to the last known address of the person
      whose name appears on the records of the city  collector  as  being  the
      owner  or  agent or as the person designated by the owner to receive tax
      bills or, where no name appears, to the premises,  addressed  to  either
      the  owner  or the agent. Such notice shall also inform the addressee of
      the existence of a complaint and appeal process including the procedures
      utilized by the borough office as provided for in paragraph eighteen  of
      subdivision  a of section twenty-nine hundred three of the New York city
      charter the right to appeal the amount  due  and  the  quality  of  work
      performed under the direction of or by the department by filing a notice
      of  a  claim  with the office of the comptroller of the city of New York
      and thereafter by filing a petition and commence a proceeding to  review
      and/or correct the notice of such account and/or the quality of the work
      performed  under  direction  of  or  by  the  department  as provided in
      sections 19-152.2 and 19-152.3 of the code and the  location  where  the
      forms  may be obtained. The owner shall only be responsible for the cost
      of reinstalling, constructing,  reconstructing,  repaving  or  repairing
      defective  sidewalk  flags ordered or directed by the department, not an
      entire sidewalk if the entire sidewalk lacks defects.
        j. If such charge is not paid within ninety  days  from  the  date  of
      entry,  it shall be the duty of the city collector to charge and receive
      interest thereon, to be calculated to the date of payment from the  date
      of entry.
        (1) Except as otherwise provided in paragraph (2) of this subdivision,
      interest  shall  be  charged  at the rate of interest applicable to such
      property for real property taxes pursuant to section 11-224 of the code.
        (2) With respect to any parcel on which the annual  tax  is  not  more
      than two thousand seven hundred fifty dollars, other than a parcel which
      consists  of vacant or unimproved land, interest shall be charged at the
      rate determined pursuant to subdivision p or at the rate  of  eight  and
      one-half percent whichever is lower.
        k.  Such  charge  and interest shall be collected and the lien thereof
      may be foreclosed in the manner provided by law for the  collection  and
      foreclosure  of  the  lien  of  taxes, sewer rents, sewer surcharges and
      water charges due and payable to the city, and the provisions of chapter
      four of title eleven of the code shall apply  to  such  charge  and  the
      interest thereon and the lien thereof.
    
        l.  In addition to collecting the charge for the cost of installation,
      construction, repaving, reconstruction and repair of a sidewalk, fencing
      of a vacant lot, filling of a sunken lot and/or cutting down any  raised
      lot as a lien, the city may maintain a civil action for recovery of such
      charge  against  a  property owner who is responsible under this section
      for such work in the first instance,  provided,  however,  that  in  the
      event  that the department performs the work without duly notifying such
      person in the manner prescribed in subdivision f, the cost to  the  city
      of  performing such work shall be prima facie evidence of the reasonable
      cost thereof.
        m. Upon application in writing of either (i) an owner of real property
      which is improved by a one, two, three, four, five or six family  house:
      or  (ii) an owner of real property which has an assessed valuation of no
      more than thirty thousand dollars, upon which a charge in excess of  two
      hundred  fifty  dollars  but  not in excess of five thousand dollars has
      been entered pursuant to this section, the commissioner of  finance  may
      agree with the owner to divide the charge into four annual installments.
      Each  installment  shall  be  as  nearly  equal  as  may  be.  The first
      installment thereof shall be  due  and  payable  upon  approval  of  the
      application  and each succeeding installment shall be due and payable on
      the next ensuing anniversary date of the date of entry  of  the  charge,
      together  with  interest  thereon  from  the  date  of entry at the rate
      determined pursuant to subdivision p,  or  at  the  rate  of  eight  and
      one-half  percent  per  annum,  whichever is lower. The commissioner may
      require  owners  of  parcels  making  application   pursuant   to   this
      subdivision  to  furnish satisfactory proof of their eligibility. In the
      event that the owner fails to make payment  of  any  installment  within
      thirty  days  of  the  due  date,  the  commissioner  may  declare  such
      installment agreement to be null and void and the balance of the  charge
      shall  become  immediately  due  and  payable  with interest at the rate
      prescribed in subdivision j of this section to be  calculated  from  the
      date  of entry to the date of payment. The installments not yet due with
      interest to date of payment may be paid at any time. The  city  may  not
      enforce  a lien against any owner who has entered into an agreement with
      the commissioner of finance pursuant to this section provided that he or
      she is not in default thereunder. No installment  shall  be  a  lien  or
      deemed  an  encumbrance upon the title to real property charged until it
      becomes due as herein  provided.  In  the  event  that  the  city  shall
      acquire,   by   condemnation  or  otherwise,  any  property  upon  which
      installments are not due, such installments shall become due as  of  the
      date  of  acquisition  of title by the city and shall be set off against
      any award that may be made for the property acquired, with  interest  to
      the date of acquisition of title.
        n. All orders or notices served by the commissioner in connection with
      the  installation, construction, reconstruction, repavement or repair of
      sidewalks, fencing of vacant lots, filling of  sunken  lots  or  cutting
      down  of  raised  lots and all charges arising out of the performance of
      such work by  the  department  subsequent  to  January  first,  nineteen
      hundred  seventy-seven  are  hereby  legalized,  validated, ratified and
      confirmed as though such orders, notices and charges were made  pursuant
      to this section.
        p.  On  or  before the first day of June, nineteen hundred eighty-six,
      and on or before the first day of June  of  each  succeeding  year,  the
      director  of  the  office  of  management and budget shall determine and
      certify the city's cost of debt service, expressed as a  percentage  and
      rounded  to  the  nearest  one-tenth  of  a  percentage  point and shall
      transmit copies of such  certification  to  the  city  council  and  the
      commissioner  of  finance.    The percentage so determined and certified
    
      shall be the rate of interest applicable for purposes of  paragraph  (2)
      of subdivision j and subdivision m during the ensuing fiscal year of the
      city,  provided,  however,  that  for  the  period beginning on February
      third,  nineteen  hundred  eighty-five  and  ending  on  June thirtieth,
      nineteen hundred eighty-six, the applicable rate of  interest  shall  be
      eight  and  one-half  percent per annum. Any rate determined pursuant to
      this subdivision shall apply to charges, or any portion  thereof,  which
      remain  or  become  due  on or after the date on which such rate becomes
      effective and shall apply only with  respect  to  interest  computed  or
      computable for periods or portions of periods occurring in the period in
      which  such rate is in effect. For the purposes of this subdivision, the
      city's cost of debt service shall be the average rate of  interest  paid
      by  the city during the first ten months of the fiscal year in which the
      determination is made on general obligation bonds  issued  by  the  city
      during  such  period  with  a  maturity  of  four years or if no general
      obligation bonds with a maturity of four years are  issued  during  such
      period,  on  general  obligation  bonds  with a maturity of no less than
      three nor more than five years.
        q. Notwithstanding any inconsistent provision  of  this  section,  the

      the  date  of  filing  the petition. Such proceeding, where practicable,
      shall be held at a location within the county in which the real property
      subject to review is located. The petitioner and the department shall be
      advised by mail of the time and place of such proceeding.
        f. The petitioner need not present expert witnesses nor be represented
      by an attorney at such hearing. Such proceedings shall be  conducted  on
      an  informal  basis  in such manner as to do substantial justice between
    
      the parties according to the rules of substantive  law.  The  petitioner
      shall  not  be  bound  by  statutory  provisions  of  rules of practice,
      procedure, pleading or evidence. The hearing officer shall be  empowered
      to  compel  the department and any other party who performed the work to
      produce  records  and  other  evidence  relevant  and  material  to  the
      proceeding.  All  statements  and  presentation  of evidence made at the
      hearing by either party shall  be  made  or  presented  to  the  hearing
      officer  who shall assure that decorum is maintained at the hearing. The
      hearing officer shall consider  the  best  evidence  presented  in  each
      particular  case. Such evidence may include but shall not be limited to,
      photographs of the sidewalk or lots,  construction  contracts  or  bills
      from  licensed  firms  that  performed  the  work to correct the alleged

      inspect the real property subject to review. The petitioner  shall  have
      the burden of proving entitlement to the relief sought.
        g.  All  parties  are  required  to  appear at the hearing. Failure to
      appear shall result in the petition being determined upon inquest by the
      hearing officer based upon the available evidence submitted.
        h. The hearing officer shall determine all questions of fact  and  law
      de novo.
        i.  The  hearing officer shall make a decision in writing with respect
      to the petition for appeal within thirty days after  conclusion  of  the
      hearing  conducted  with respect thereto. The hearing officer's decision
      may grant the petition in full or in part or may deny the  petition.  If
      the  hearing officer grants the petition in full or in part, the hearing
      officer shall award the petitioner costs against the  respondent  in  an
      amount  equal to the fee paid by the petitioner to file the petition for
      appeal. The hearing officer may award the petitioner costs  against  the
      respondent  in an amount equal to the fee paid by the petitioner to file
      the petition for appeal where he deems it appropriate.
        j. If the hearing officer grants the petition in full or in part,  the
      hearing officer shall order the department and the city collector, where
      appropriate,   to  change  or  correct  their  records  to  reflect  the
      determination  or  order  the  work  corrected  and  reinspected  by   a
      departmental inspector after the work was performed.
        k.  The  decision  of  the hearing officer shall state the findings of
      fact and the evidence upon which it is based. Such  decisions  shall  be
      attached  to and made part of the petition for appeal and shall be dated
      and signed.
        l. The hearing officer shall promptly transmit  the  decision  to  the
      clerk  of the court, who shall file and enter it and the hearing officer
      shall promptly mail a copy of the decision  to  the  petitioner  or  the
      commissioner  of  the department or the designee of the commissioner and
      to the city collector, where appropriate.
        m. No transcript of testimony shall be made of a small  claims  review
      hearing.  The  hearing  officer's decision of a petition of appeal shall
      not constitute precedent for any purpose  or  proceeding  involving  the
      parties or any other person or persons.
        n.  A  petitioner  to  an  action  pursuant  to  this section may seek
      judicial review pursuant to article seventy-eight of the civil  practice
      law  and rules provided that such review shall be maintained against the
      same parties named in the small claims petition.
        o. The chief administrator of the courts shall  adopt  such  rules  of
      practice and procedure, not inconsistent herewith as may be necessary to
      implement  the  appeal  procedures  hereby established. Such rules shall
      provide for the scheduling of evening hearings  where  practicable,  the
      availability  of  petition  forms,  and the procedures for the filing of
    
      decisions rendered by hearing officers pursuant  to  the  provisions  of
      this section.
        p.  If in the final order in any proceeding, it is determined that the
      amount due was excessive or improper and ordered or  directed  that  the
      same  be corrected, the city collector shall issue and mail a new notice
      of such account stating the new amount owed to  the  person  whose  name
      appears  on  the records of the city collector as being the owner of the
      premises. If the records of the city collector show that a  party  other
      than  the  owner  has  been designated to receive the tax bills for such
      property, the notice shall be mailed to such party as  well  as  to  the
      owner  of  record,  at  his  or  her  last known address, or, if it is a
      multiple dwelling, service upon the owner or managing agent may be  made
      in  accordance  with  section 27-2095 of the code. If such charge is not
      paid within ninety days from the date of entry, it shall be the duty  of
      the  city  collector  to  charge  and  receive  interest  thereon, to be
      calculated to the  date  of  payment  from  the  date  of  entry.  Where
      appropriate,  if  in the final order in any proceeding, it is determined
      that the amount due was excessive or  improper  and  the  owner  of  the
      property  is  entitled to a refund for the excessive amount, the hearing
      officer shall promptly order and direct such refund within thirty days.
        q. If in the final order in any proceeding, it is determined that  the
      final  work  was  improper  and  ordered  or  directed  that the same be
      corrected, the department shall issue and mail  a  new  notice  of  such
      within  thirty days stating when the same will be corrected and by whom,
      by mail, addressed to the person whose name appears on  the  records  of
      the city collector as being the owner of the premises. If the records of
      the  city  collector  show  that  a  party other than the owner has been
      designated to receive the tax bills for such property, the notice  shall
      be mailed to such party as well as to the owner of record, at his or her
      last  known  address, or, if it is a multiple dwelling, service upon the
      owner or managing agent may be made in accordance with  section  27-2095
      of the code.

      this section that has been found to emit stray voltage shall be repaired
      or  made safe within twenty-four hours of discovery or knowledge of such
      condition by the local electric corporation that owns and  operates  the
      infrastructure,  or  a  contractor or subcontractor thereof, in a manner
      that completely eliminates the emission of any such stray voltage.
        e. Upon completion  of  the  annual  inspection,  testing  and  repair
      program  mandated  by  subdivision c of this section, all local electric
      corporations shall provide the council, the department  and  the  public
      service  commission  with  a  written report no later than January 15 of

      electrical-related  infrastructure  has  been  inspected where required,
      tested  where  required,  and,  if  necessary,   repaired   during   the
      immediately  preceding  inspection and testing period. Such report shall
      indicate each location at which stray voltage was found and shall  state
      that in each such instance, each repair was completed in accordance with
      accepted professional standards and that no public safety hazard exists.
    
      Such   report   shall  include  a  detailed  account  of  all  types  of
      non-conductive protective materials  utilized  to  insulate  such  local
      electric  corporation's  electrical-related  infrastructure  during  the
      period  being reported upon, as well as any planned changes in the types
      of non-conductive protective materials to be employed  during  the  next
      reporting  period to meet the mandate set forth in subdivision b of this
      section with an explanation for any proposed change. Such  report  shall
      also  include  a complete list of all inspections, tests and repairs for
      the detection and elimination of stray  voltage  conducted  outside  the
      course of the inspection and testing schedules required by subdivision c
      of  this  section,  such  as  those  initiated  in  response to consumer
      complaints,  including  the  nature  and  location  of   the   condition
      complained  of,  whether the complaint was founded, what repair work was
      undertaken and to what category of electrical-related infrastructure and
      the amount of time taken from receipt of  the  complaint  to  completely
      eliminate any stray voltage.
        f.   The  department  shall  conduct  random  tests,  by  utilizing  a
      voltmeter,  of  the  electrical-related  infrastructure  of  any   local
      electric  corporation  for  the  purposes of detecting stray voltage and
      shall maintain written  reports  of  the  results  of  each  such  test.

      fifty such tests at random sites during each twelve month inspection and
      testing period. The reports created pursuant to this  testing  shall  be
      forwarded  to  the  public  service commission and to the local electric
      corporation whose sites the department tests.
        g. All local electric corporations shall establish  and  implement  an
      educational  campaign  aimed  at informing the public of how to identify
      and protect themselves from the dangers  of  stray  voltage  potentially
      emanating  from  their  electrical-related  infrastructure. The campaign
      shall utilize the information from the  annual  report  of  inspections,
      tests  and  repairs  required by this section to alert the public to the
      locations most frequently documented as having had stray voltage.
