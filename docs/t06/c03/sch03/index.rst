Section 6-306 ::    
        
     
        ยง 6-306 Energy  efficiency  standards.  a.  Any  energy-using  product
      purchased  or  leased  by  any  agency  for  which  the  United   States
      environmental  protection  agency  and  the  United States department of
      energy have developed energy efficiency standards  for  compliance  with
      the Energy Star program shall be ENERGY STAR labeled.
        b.  Any  faucet,  showerhead,  toilet,  urinal, fluorescent tube lamp,
      fluorescent ballast,  industrial  HID  luminaire,  downlight  luminaire,
      fluorescent  luminaire  or compact fluorescent lamp that is purchased or
      leased by any agency for which the federal energy management program  of
      the  United  States  department  of  energy  has  issued  product energy
      efficiency recommendations shall achieve no less  energy  efficiency  or
      flow rate than the minimum recommended in such recommendations.
        c.  Unless  the  director  makes  a  determination  otherwise  for any
      particular contract, any air-cooled chiller or water-cooled chiller that
      is purchased or leased by  any  agency  for  which  the  federal  energy
      management  program of the United States department of energy has issued
      product energy efficiency recommendations shall achieve no  less  energy
      efficiency   or   flow   rate  than  the  minimum  recommended  in  such
      recommendations.
        d. Beginning January 1, 2008, the director shall make a  determination
      whether  or not any product not specified in subdivisions a or b of this
      section that is purchased or leased by any agency for which the  federal
      energy  management program of the United States department of energy has
      issued product energy efficiency recommendations shall achieve  no  less
      energy  efficiency  or  flow  rate  than the minimum recommended in such
      recommendations. The director shall review any such determination not to
      require compliance with the federal energy management  program  for  any
      product at least once every two years.
        e.  Beginning  January 1, 2008, unless prior to such date the director
      determines that products that would comply with this subdivision are not
      available in  sufficient  quantities  and  upon  reasonable  terms,  the
      minimum energy efficiency of the power supply of any desktop computer or
      desktop-derived  server  purchased or leased by any agency containing an
      internally mounted power supply shall be 80% at 20%,  50%  and  100%  of
      rated  power  supply  output,  when  tested  according to a proportional
      allocation method of  loading  the  power  supply.  The  director  shall
      investigate  the  feasibility  of purchasing such products prior to such
      date. In the event that this subdivision does not apply after January 1,
      2008 as a result of any determination  of  the  director,  the  director
      shall  annually  reconsider any such determination and, where applicable
      as a result  of  any  such  reconsideration,  the  requirement  in  this
      subdivision shall take effect as soon as practicable thereafter.
        f.  No lamp purchased or leased by any agency shall be an incandescent
      lamp if  a  more  energy  efficient  lamp  is  available  that  provides
      sufficient  lumens  and  is  of  an  appropriate  size  for the intended
      application.

Section 6-307 ::    
        
     
        ยง  6-307  Office  equipment  energy  use reduction. a. Notwithstanding
      section 6-302 of this chapter, this section shall apply to any computer,
      printer, facsimile machine or photocopy machine owned or leased  by  any
      agency.
        b.  The  power  management  software options of any computer, printer,
      facsimile machine or photocopy machine that contains such software shall
      be calibrated to achieve the highest energy savings practicable.
        c. For any computer  that  contains  power  management  software,  the
      computer  monitor and central processing unit shall be set to enter into
      a low power mode after the shortest practicable  period  of  inactivity.
      Any  screensaver or other computer program that directly interferes with
      the proper functioning of the low power mode of any computer monitor  or
      central processing unit, shall be disabled.
        d.  Any  agency need not comply with the provisions of this section if
      compliance would interfere with any mission  of  such  agency  or  cause
      instability in any computer system.
