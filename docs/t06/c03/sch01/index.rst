      pursuant  to any contract with any agency for construction work that (1)
      is a capital project and (2) is in a building or portion of  a  building
      that is leased for the use of a single agency where such single agency's

      highest  quality  product  at  the  lowest  possible  price  through   a
      competitive  procurement,  provided  that in making any such finding the
      contracting agency shall consider life-cycle cost-effectiveness; and

      would not be consistent with such agency's ability to obtain the highest
      quality product at the  lowest  possible  price  through  a  competitive
      procurement,  provided  that  in making any such finding the contracting
      agency  shall  consider  the  health  and  safety   benefits   of   such
      specification.
        b.  The city's environmental purchasing standards may be waived by the
      director upon application by any agency:

      standards would conflict with any consumer, health or safety:
        (i) regulation of any agency; or
        (ii) requirement of the federal government or state of New York or any
      nationally recognized testing laboratory designated by the director; or
        (2)  for  any  product if there are fewer than five manufacturers that
      produce  such  product  meeting  the  city's  environmental   purchasing
      standards  and  that  are  capable  of  producing  any such product in a
      quantity and within a time period  that  are  adequate  for  the  city's
      needs.
        c.  Any  application  for any waiver pursuant to this section shall be
      made in writing by the applying agency. The  director  shall,  within  a
      reasonable  period  of time, issue a written determination on whether to
      grant any such waiver application and shall include  an  explanation  of
      any such determination.

      exempt from the provisions of this chapter up  to  the  following  total
      dollar  amounts,  provided  such  amounts  shall be indexed to inflation
