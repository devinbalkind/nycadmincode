      shall be entitled to a pension of not less than one-half of  the  salary
      received  by  him  or  her  per  year.  When  the commissioner, however,
      designates a captain to act in the place  of  a  captain  under  regular
      detail  as  inspector, during the temporary absence or disability of the
      latter the officer so designated shall not be entitled to any additional
      salary, and the period of such designation shall not be counted  in  his
      or  her  favor  in  computing such two-year period. When a captain shall
      have served in the rank of captain for a period of ten years, he or  she
      shall  have  the  same rights in respect to the police pension fund as a
      captain detailed to act as inspector who shall have served as such for a
      period of time aggregating two years. A captain who shall have served as
      such less than ten years and more than five years shall  have  the  same
      rights  in  respect to such police pension fund as a captain detailed to
      act as a deputy inspector who shall have served as such for a period  of
      time aggregating two years. A period beginning March thirtieth, nineteen
      hundred  sixty-five,  and  ending  November  thirtieth, nineteen hundred
      sixty-six, during which a captain shall have  served  as  a  provisional
      captain immediately prior to a permanent promotion to such rank shall be
      deemed  to  have been service as a permanent captain for the purposes of
      this section. A captain, while detailed to act as  inspector,  shall  be
      chargeable with and responsible for the discipline and efficiency of the
      force under his or her command.

      or disobedience of orders, or absence  without  leave,  or  any  conduct
      injurious  to the public peace or welfare, or immoral conduct or conduct
      unbecoming an officer, or  any  breach  of  discipline,  to  punish  the
      offending  party  by  reprimand,  forfeiting  and  withholding pay for a
      specified time, suspension, without pay during such  suspension,  or  by
      dismissal  from the force; but no more than thirty days' salary shall be

        b. Members of the force, except as elsewhere provided herein, shall be
      fined,  reprimanded, removed, suspended or dismissed from the force only
      on written charges made or preferred against them,  after  such  charges
      have been examined, heard and investigated by the commissioner or one of
      his or her deputies upon such reasonable notice to the member or members
      charged,  and  in  such  manner  or procedure, practice, examination and
      investigation as such commissioner may, by rules and  regulations,  from
      time to time prescribe.
        c.  The  commissioner  is  also authorized and empowered in his or her
      discretion, to deduct and withhold salary from any member or members  of
      the  force,  for  or  on account of absence for any cause without leave,
      lost time, sickness or other disability, physical or  mental;  provided,
      however,  that  the salary so deducted and withheld shall not, except in
      case of absence without leave, exceed one-half thereof for the period of
      such absence; and provided, further, that not more than one-half pay for
      three days shall be deducted on account of absence caused by sickness.
        d. Upon having found a member of  the  force  guilty  of  the  charges
      preferred  against  him or her, either upon such member's plea of guilty
      or after trial, the commissioner or the deputy  examining,  hearing  and
      investigating  the  charges,  in  his  or  her  discretion,  may suspend
      judgment and place  the  member  of  the  force  so  found  guilty  upon
      probation, for a period not exceeding one year; and the commissioner may
      impose punishment at any time during such period.

      cause, only if such action,  suit  or  proceedings  shall  be  commenced
      within two years after the cause of action shall have accrued.
        b.  A  proceeding  may  be  brought  to  procure  the  restoration  or
      reinstatement to the force  or  department  of  any  member  or  officer
      thereof,  if  such proceeding be instituted within four months after the

      hearing  by a term of the court not later than the second term after the
      filing of the answer or return and of service of notice of  such  filing

      child fingerprinted at school.
        c.   No  child  may  be  fingerprinted  without  first  presenting  an

      a.  Upon  written  application  to  the  mayor  by the person aggrieved,
      setting forth the reasons for demanding such rehearing, the commissioner
      may rehear the charges upon which a member or a probationary  member  of
      the  uniformed  force  has  been  dismissed,  or  reduced  from the rank
      theretofore held by him or her. Such person or persons shall be required
      to waive in writing all claim against the city for back  pay  and  shall
      obtain from the mayor his or her consent to such rehearing, such consent
      to  be  in  writing  and to state the reasons why such charges should be
      reheard.
        b. Such application for a rehearing shall be made within one year from
      the date of the removal or reduction in rank.
        c. If the commissioner shall  determine  that  such  member  has  been
      illegally  or  unjustly  dismissed  or  reduced,  the  commissioner  may
      reinstate such member or restore him or her to the rank from which he or
      she was reduced, as the case may be, and allow him or her the  whole  of
      his  or  her time since such dismissal, to be applied on his or her time
      of service in the department, or the commissioner may grant  such  other
      or  further  relief  as  he  or  she  may  determine  to be just, or the
      commissioner may affirm the dismissal or reduction, as  he  or  she  may
      determine from the evidence.
        d.  If  the  applicant be a probationary member of the department, the
      commissioner may  allow  him  or  her  the  time  already  served  as  a
      probationary  member  to  count  as time served, but shall not allow the
      time between the date of his or her dismissal and his or her restoration
      to count as service in the department.
        e. Employees of  the  department,  not  entitled  to  a  trial  before
      dismissal,  and  who were given an opportunity to explain charges before
      they were removed, may apply to the mayor, within one year from the date
      of the order separating them from the service, for a further opportunity
      to explain, setting forth the reasons for such action. The mayor, in his
      or  her  discretion,  may  grant  such  application.  The  commissioner,
      thereupon,  shall afford a further opportunity to the dismissed employee
      to explain the charges filed against him or her, on  which  the  removal
      was  based.  Thereafter  the commissioner, in his or her discretion, may
      reinstate the dismissed employee or reaffirm the previous removal. Prior
      to any reinstatement  hereunder,  such  former  employee  shall  file  a
      written  statement  waiving  all  claim  or  claims  for back salary and
      damages of any kind whatsoever.

      conception, or wines, fermented liquors and  other  alcoholic  beverages
      and  the  receptacles thereof, or soiled, bloody or unsanitary clothing,
      or solids and liquids of unknown or  uncertain  composition,  or  opium,

      poisonous, noxious, or deleterious solids or liquids,  or  any  property
      which in the opinion of the commissioner, is of slight value or the sale
      of  which might result in injury to the health, welfare or safety of the
      public, may direct and empower the property clerk to  destroy  each  and
      every  article  of  such nature. If, in the opinion of the commissioner,
      any such property may be used or converted to use for the purpose of the
      department or any city, state or federal agency, such  property  may  in
      the  discretion  of the commissioner be used or converted to use for any
      such purpose, and the same need not be sold  or  destroyed  as  in  this
      section provided.
        3.  Perishable property may be sold as soon as practicable on the best
      terms available and the proceeds of such sale shall be disposed of as in
      this section provided.
        f.  Lawful  property  right  to  be  established.  In  any  action  or
      proceeding  against the property clerk for or on account of any property
      or money in his or her custody, a claimant from  whose  possession  such
      property  or  money  was taken or obtained, or any other claimant, shall
      establish that he or she has a lawful title or property  right  in  such
      property or money and lawfully obtained possession thereof and that such
      property  or  money  was  held  and used in a lawful manner. In any such
      action or proceeding, a claimant who derives his or her title  or  right
      by  assignment,  transfer  or  otherwise from or through the person from
      whose possession such property or money was  taken  or  obtained,  shall
      further  establish that such person had a lawful title or property right
      in such property or money and lawfully obtained possession  thereof  and
      that such property or money was held and used in a lawful manner.
        g.  No  action  for  property  or money held as evidence. No action or
      proceeding may be brought against the property clerk for or  on  account
      of  any property or money held as evidence in any criminal investigation
      or proceeding until the termination thereof.
        h. Preservation of property. Where the property consists  of  furs  or
      other  valuable  property that may be subject to deterioration or damage
      if stored by the property clerk,  the  property  clerk  in  his  or  her
      discretion may store such property with a private concern having special
      facilities  for  such storage, and the cost thereof shall be a lien upon
      such property to be paid by the owner thereof prior to the  recovery  of
      such property.
        i. Removal and storage charges for motor vehicles and boats.
        1.  Whenever an abandoned motor vehicle or boat, or a motor vehicle or
      boat involved in an accident, or a boat found adrift and unoccupied upon
      the waters of the city of New York  which  is  in  the  custody  of  the
      property  clerk,  shall be claimed by the owner or other person lawfully
      entitled to possession thereof, such owner or other person shall not  be
      entitled  to  the return thereof unless he or she shall first pay to the
      property clerk a removal charge of twenty-five  dollars  and  a  storage
      charge of five dollars for each day, or fraction thereof, except that in
      the  case  of  a boat found adrift and unoccupied upon the waters of the
      city of New York, such storage charge shall not be applied  until  three
    
      days  after  notice  to  the  owner by registered mail from the property
      clerk that such boat is in police custody.
        2. Whenever a stolen motor vehicle or boat, which is in the custody of
      the  property  clerk,  shall not be removed by the owner or other person
      lawfully entitled to possession thereof within three days  after  notice
      by  registered  mail from the property clerk, such owner or other person
      shall not be entitled to the return thereof unless he or she shall first
      pay to the property clerk a storage charge of five dollars for each day,
      or fraction thereof, after the expiration of such three-day period.
        3. Notwithstanding the provisions of paragraphs one and  two  of  this
      subdivision,  where  the department has incurred charges for removal and
      storage of an abandoned or stolen motor vehicle pursuant  to  subchapter
      thirty-one of chapter two of title twenty of the code, an owner or other
      person  lawfully  entitled to possession of such motor vehicle shall not
      be entitled to the return thereof unless he or she shall first  pay  all
      such  charges  incurred  by  the  department pursuant to such subchapter
      thirty-one together with any applicable storage charge provided  for  in
      this subdivision.
        4.  The  removal  and storage charges provided by this subdivision, or
      incurred by the department pursuant to subchapter thirty-one of  chapter
      two  of  title  twenty of such code, as applicable, shall be a lien upon
      such motor vehicle or boat and the property clerk shall refuse to return
      such motor vehicle or boat until such  charges  are  paid,  except  that
      where  such  motor  vehicle  or  boat  is  the  property  of  an  estate
      administered by a public  administrator,  the  removal  charge  and  the
      storage  charge  shall  be  general  claims  against  the  estate of the
      deceased.
        5. The property clerk shall not require the  payment  of  any  charges
      provided  by  this  subdivision  for the removal or storage of any motor
      vehicle or boat in his or her custody while it is held as evidence in  a
      criminal investigation or proceeding.
        6.  It  shall  be  the  duty  of the property clerk to keep a complete
      record of the moneys collected pursuant to this subdivision. Such moneys
      shall be paid into the general fund of the city established pursuant  to
      section one hundred nine of the charter.
        j. Property and money desired to be produced in criminal court. If any
      property  or  money placed in the custody of the property clerk shall be
      desired to be produced as evidence in any criminal court, such  property
      or money shall be delivered to any officer who shall present an order to
      that  effect  from such court. Property or money used as evidence in any
      criminal court shall not be retained in such court but shall  be  turned
      over  as  soon  as  practicable  to the property clerk to be disposed of
      according to the provisions of this section.
        k. Public administrators not affected. Nothing in this  section  shall
      in  any  way contravene, modify or repeal any existing provision of law,
      general,  special  or  local,  relating  to  the  jurisdiction,  powers,
      privileges, personnel, duties and functions of any public administrator.

        §  14-147 Workers' compensation for members of auxiliary police. a. As
      used in this section, the term "member of the  auxiliary  police"  shall
      mean  and include only a volunteer who is a duly enrolled member in good
      standing of the auxiliary police which the city is authorized to recruit
      by subdivision five of  section  twenty-three  of  the  New  York  state
      defense  emergency  act, as enacted by chapter seven hundred eighty-four
      of the laws of nineteen hundred fifty-one, and who  is  not  within  the
      coverage of the workers' compensation law pursuant to group seventeen of
      subdivision one of section three of the workers' compensation law.
        b.  Pursuant  to  the  authorization  contained  in  group nineteen of
      subdivision one of section three of the workers'  compensation  law  the
      coverage  of  the  workers'  compensation  law is hereby extended to the
      activities of any member of the auxiliary police during any period which
      such member is actually  engaged  in  auxiliary  police  activites  duly
      authorized  by regulation or order issued pursuant to the New York state
      defense emergency act including any such activities as may be prescribed
      by the commissioner of the city pursuant to such  regulation  or  order,
      such  coverage  shall extend to such member of the auxiliary police, but
      only to the extent that such member is not, as to any  such  activities,
      covered by article ten of the workers' compensation law.
    
    
    
    
    
    
    

Section 14-148
--------------

Section 14-148 ::    
        
     
        §  14-148  Uniform  allowance  for  members  of  auxiliary  police. a.
      Legislative intent. In the public interest and under the powers  granted
      by  the  charter  to  the  council to enact legislation for the good and
      welfare of the citizens of New York, it is the intent of the council  by
      this  legislation  to  attract  more men and women to serve as auxiliary
      police. These men or women are trained by our regular police forces  and
      are similarly uniformed and equipped except that they do not carry guns.
      The  appearance  on  the streets of many men or women wearing the police
      uniform, in precincts where auxiliary police are active, has  done  much
      to reduce the crime rates in those areas. Auxiliary police serve without
      pay  as  civic minded citizens. Their presence in uniform on the streets
      serves to release regular uniformed police for patrol duty  and  lessens
      the  neighborhood fear of crime. Auxiliary police patrol in pairs and by
      radio can summon instant assistance from the regular police should  they
      encounter  a situation which they have not been trained to handle. Their
      presence on the streets makes for good community relations  between  the
      citizens  and the regular police. It is small repayment for the valuable
      services they render to provide them with a uniform allowance.
        b. Allowance. Duly enrolled members in good standing of the  auxiliary
      police, upon successful completion of training, shall receive an initial
      allowance  not  to  exceed two hundred fifty dollars towards the initial
      purchase of uniforms  and  accessories  for  same,  including  care  and
      maintenance.  The  amount  of  such allowance shall be determined by the
      police commissioner and shall not exceed the actual costs  incurred  for
      such  uniforms  and  accessories  including  care  and maintenance. Such
      members other than those receiving such initial allowance  in  the  then
      current  or  preceding  fiscal  year, shall be eligible for an allowance
      towards the purchase of uniforms and  accessories  for  same,  including
      care  and  maintenance  to  be  awarded  to  each  such member who shall
      otherwise qualify in accordance with the provisions of this subdivision.
      The commissioner shall determine the  amount  of  the  allowance  to  be
      awarded based on but not limited to the member's participation, hours of
      service, expense incurred in maintaining uniforms and equipment and such
      other facts deemed pertinent by the commissioner. Payments shall be made
      for  the  preceding  fiscal  year  after certification by the commanding
      officer of the auxiliary forces section to the  police  commissioner  of
      such  facts  as the commissioner may deem pertinent to enable him or her
      to make his or her determination.
        c. Auxiliary police  not  to  be  members  of  regular  police  force.
      Notwithstanding the provisions of this section nothing contained therein
      shall  be construed to constitute such auxiliary police officers members
      of the regular police force or to entitle them  to  the  privileges  and
      benefits  of the regular police force or to become members of the police
      pension funds.

Section 14-151
--------------

Section 14-151 ::    
        
     
        §  14-151  Bias-based Profiling Prohibited. a. Definitions. As used in
      this section, the following terms have the following meanings:
        1. "Bias-based profiling" means an act of a member of the force of the
      police department or other law enforcement officer that relies on actual
      or perceived race, national  origin,  color,  creed,  age,  alienage  or
      citizenship  status,  gender, sexual orientation, disability, or housing
      status as the determinative factor in initiating law enforcement  action
      against  an  individual,  rather  than an individual's behavior or other
      information or circumstances that links a person or persons to suspected
      unlawful activity.
        2. "Law enforcement officer" means  (i)  a  peace  officer  or  police
      officer  as defined in the Criminal Procedure Law who is employed by the
      city of New York; or (ii) a special patrolman appointed  by  the  police
      commissioner pursuant to section 14-106 of the administrative code.
        3.  The  terms  "national  origin,"  "gender,"  "disability,"  "sexual
      orientation," and "alienage or citizenship status" shall have  the  same
      meaning as in section 8-102 of the administrative code.
        4.  "Housing  status" means the character of an individual's residence
      or lack thereof, whether publicly  or  privately  owned,  whether  on  a
      temporary or permanent basis, and shall include but not be limited to:
        (i)  an  individual's ownership status with regard to the individual's
      residence;
        (ii) the status of having or not having a fixed residence;
        (iii) an individual's use of publicly assisted housing;
        (iv) an individual's use of the shelter system; and
        (v) an individual's actual or perceived homelessness.
        b. Prohibition.
        1. Every member of the police  department  or  other  law  enforcement
      officer shall be prohibited from engaging in bias-based profiling.
        2.  The  department  shall  be  prohibited from engaging in bias-based
      profiling.
        c. Private Right of Action
        1. A claim of bias-based profiling is established under  this  section
      when an individual brings an action demonstrating that:
        (i)  the  governmental  body  has  engaged  in  intentional bias-based
      profiling of one or more individuals and the governmental body fails  to
      prove  that  such  bias-based  profiling  (A)  is necessary to achieve a
      compelling governmental  interest  and  (B)  was  narrowly  tailored  to
      achieve that compelling governmental interest; or
        (ii)  one  or more law enforcement officers have intentionally engaged
      in bias-based  profiling  of  one  or  more  individuals;  and  the  law
      enforcement  officer(s)  against  whom such action is brought fail(s) to
      prove that the law enforcement  action  at  issue  was  justified  by  a
      factor(s) unrelated to unlawful discrimination.
        2.  A  claim  of  bias-based  profiling is also established under this
      section when:
        (i) a policy or practice within the police department or  a  group  of
      policies  or  practices  within  the  police  department  regarding  the
      initiation of law enforcement action has had a disparate impact  on  the
      subjects  of  law  enforcement  action  on  the basis of characteristics
      delineated in paragraph 1 of subdivision a of this  section,  such  that
      the policy or practice on the subjects of law enforcement action has the
      effect of bias-based profiling; and
        (ii)  The police department fails to plead and prove as an affirmative
      defense  that  each  such  policy  or  practice  bears   a   significant
      relationship  to  advancing  a  significant law enforcement objective or
      does not contribute to the disparate impact; provided, however, that  if
      such  person  who  may  bring  an  action  demonstrates  that a group of
    
      policies or practices results in a disparate impact, such  person  shall
      not  be  required  to  demonstrate  which specific policies or practices
      within the group results in such  disparate  impact;  provided  further,
      that a policy or practice or group of policies or practices demonstrated
      to  result in a disparate impact shall be unlawful where such person who
      may bring an action produces substantial evidence  that  an  alternative
      policy  or  practice  with  less  disparate  impact is available and the
      police department  fails  to  prove  that  such  alternative  policy  or
      practice would not serve the law enforcement objective as well.
        (iii)  For  purposes of claims brought pursuant to this paragraph, the
      mere existence  of  a  statistical  imbalance  between  the  demographic
      composition of the subjects of the challenged law enforcement action and
      the  general  population  is  not  alone sufficient to establish a prima
      facie case of disparate impact violation unless the  general  population
      is  shown to be the relevant pool for comparison, the imbalance is shown
      to be statistically significant and there is an identifiable  policy  or
      practice  or  group  of  policies or practices that allegedly causes the
      imbalance.
        d. Enforcement
        1. An  individual  subject  to  bias-based  profiling  as  defined  in
      paragraph  1  of subdivision a of this section may file a complaint with
      the New York City Commission on Human Rights, pursuant to Title 8 of the
      Administrative Code of the City of New York, or may bring a civil action
      against (i) any governmental  body  that  employs  any  law  enforcement
      officer  who  has  engaged,  is  engaging,  or  continues  to  engage in
      bias-based profiling, (ii) any law enforcement officer who has  engaged,
      is  engaging,  or continues to engage in bias-based profiling, and (iii)
      the police department where it has engaged, is engaging, or continues to
      engage in bias-based profiling or policies or practices  that  have  the
      effect of bias-based profiling.
        2.  The  remedy  in  any  civil  action  or  administrative proceeding
      undertaken pursuant to this section shall be limited to  injunctive  and
      declaratory relief.
        3.  In any action or proceeding to enforce this section, the court may
      allow a prevailing plaintiff reasonable attorney's fees as part  of  the
      costs, and may include expert fees as part of the attorney's fees.
        e.  Preservation  of  rights. This section shall be in addition to all
      rights, procedures, and  remedies  available  under  the  United  States
      Constitution,  Section  1983  of Title 42 of the United States Code, the
      Constitution of the State of New York and all other federal  law,  state
      law,  law  of  the  City of New York or the New York City Administrative
      Code, and all pre-existing civil remedies, including  monetary  damages,
      created by statute, ordinance, regulation or common law.
