Section 26-501 ::    
        
     
        * ยง  26-501  Findings and declaration of emergency. The council hereby
      finds that a serious public emergency continues to exist in the  housing
      of a considerable number of persons within the city of New York and will
      continue to exist after April first, nineteen hundred seventy-four; that
      such emergency necessitated the intervention of federal, state and local
      government  in  order  to  prevent speculative, unwarranted and abnormal
      increases in rents; that there continues to exist an acute  shortage  of
      dwellings  which  creates  a  special  hardship  to persons and families
      occupying rental housing;  that  the  legislation  enacted  in  nineteen
      hundred  seventy-one  by  the  state  of  New York, removing controls on
      housing accommodations as they become  vacant,  has  resulted  in  sharp
      increases  in  rent  levels  in  many  instances;  that the existing and
      proposed cuts in federal  assistance  to  housing  programs  threaten  a
      virtual  end to the creation of new housing, thus prolonging the present
      emergency; that unless residential rents and evictions  continue  to  be
      regulated  and  controlled, disruptive practices and abnormal conditions
      will produce serious threats to the public health,  safety  and  general
      welfare;  that  to  prevent  such  perils to health, safety and welfare,
      preventive action by the council continues to be imperative;  that  such
      action   is   necessary   in  order  to  prevent  exactions  of  unjust,
      unreasonable and oppressive rents and rental agreements and to forestall
      profiteering, speculation and  other  disruptive  practices  tending  to
      produce  threats  to the public health, safety and general welfare; that
      the transition from regulation to a normal  market  of  free  bargaining
      between landlord and tenant, while still the objective of state and city
      policy,  must  be  administered  with due regard for such emergency; and
      that the policy herein expressed is now administered locally within  the
      city  of  New  York  by  an  agency  of the city itself, pursuant to the
      authority conferred by  chapter  twenty-one  of  the  laws  of  nineteen
      hundred sixty-two.
        The  council  further  finds that, prior to the adoption of local laws
      sixteen and fifty-one of nineteen hundred  sixty-nine,  many  owners  of
      housing  accommodations  in  multiple  dwellings,  not  subject  to  the
      provisions of the city rent and rehabilitation law enacted  pursuant  to
      said  enabling  authority  either  because  they  were constructed after
      nineteen hundred forty-seven or because they were  decontrolled  due  to
      monthly  rental  of  two  hundred  fifty  dollars  or  more or for other
      reasons, were demanding exorbitant and unconscionable rent increases  as
      a  result  of  the  aforesaid  emergency,  which  led  to  a  continuing
      restriction of available housing as evidenced by  the  nineteen  hundred
      sixty-eight  vacancy  survey  by the United States bureau of the census;
      that prior to the enactment of said  local  laws,  such  increases  were
      being  exacted under stress of prevailing conditions of inflation and of
      an acute housing shortage resulting from  a  sharp  decline  in  private
      residential  construction  brought  about  by a combination of local and
      national factors; that such increases and demands  were  causing  severe
      hardship  to tenants of such accommodations and were uprooting long-time
      city residents from their communities;  that  recent  studies  establish
      that  the acute housing shortage continues to exist; that there has been
      a further decline in private residential construction  due  to  existing
      and proposed cuts in federal assistance to housing programs; that unless
      such  accommodations  are  subjected  to  reasonable  rent  and eviction
      limitations, disruptive practices and abnormal conditions  will  produce
      serious  threats  to  the public health, safety and general welfare; and
      that such conditions constitute a grave emergency.

      thousand  twelve and hereby reaffirms and repromulgates the findings and

      regulation under the private housing finance law or any other state law,
      (c)  aided  by  government insurance under any provision of the national

      building for which a certificate of occupancy is  obtained  after  March
      tenth, nineteen hundred sixty-nine; or (e) any class A multiple dwelling

      which   customarily   provides  hotel  service  such  as  maid  service,
      furnishing and laundering of linen,  telephone  and  bell  boy  service,
      secretarial  or  desk  service  and  use  and  upkeep  of  furniture and
      fixtures, or (f) not occupied by the tenant, not including subtenants or
      occupants, as his or her primary residence, as determined by a court  of
      competent  jurisdiction,  provided, however that no action or proceeding
      shall be commenced seeking to recover possession on the  ground  that  a
      housing  accommodation  is  not  occupied  by  the  tenant as his or her
      primary residence unless the owner or lessor  shall  have  given  thirty
      days  notice  to  the  tenant  of  his or her intention to commence such
      action or proceeding on such grounds. For the  purposes  of  determining
      primary  residency,  a  tenant  who is a victim of domestic violence, as
      defined in section four hundred fifty-nine-a of the social services law,
      who has left the unit because of  such  violence,  and  who  asserts  an
      intent  to  return  to  the  housing accommodation shall be deemed to be
      occupying the unit as his or her primary residence. For the purposes  of
      this   subparagraph  where  a  housing  accommodation  is  rented  to  a

      because  the  landlord  or  any person acting on his or her behalf, with
      intent to cause the tenant to vacate, engaged in any course  of  conduct
      (including  but  not  limited  to,  interruption  or  discontinuance  of
      essential services) which interfered with or disturbed or  was  intended
      to  interfere with or disturb the comfort, repose, peace or quiet of the
      tenant in his or her use or occupancy of the housing accommodations  and
      provided  further  that  any  housing  accommodations  exempted  by this
      paragraph shall be subject  to  this  law  to  the  extent  provided  in
      subdivision b of this section; or (2) were decontrolled by the city rent
      agency  pursuant to section 26-414 of this title; or (3) are exempt from
      control by virtue of item one, two, six or seven of subparagraph (i)  of

      section  11-243 or section 11-244 of the code or article eighteen of the
      private housing finance  law,  not  owned  as  a  cooperative  or  as  a
      condominium,  except as provided in section three hundred fifty-two-eeee
    
      of the general business law and not subject to  chapter  three  of  this
      title. Upon the expiration or termination for any reason of the benefits
      of  section  11-243 or section 11-244 of the code or article eighteen of
      the  private housing finance law any such dwelling unit shall be subject
      to this chapter until the occurrence of the first vacancy of  such  unit
      after  such  benefits  are no longer being received or if each lease and
      renewal thereof for such unit for the tenant in residence at the time of
      the expiration of the tax benefit period has included  a  notice  in  at
      least twelve point type informing such tenant that the unit shall become
      subject  to  deregulation upon the expiration of such tax benefit period
      and states the approximate date on which  such  tax  benefit  period  is
      scheduled  to  expire, such dwelling unit shall be deregulated as of the
      end of the tax benefit period; provided, however, that if such  dwelling
      unit  would  have  been  subject to this chapter or the emergency tenant
      protection  act  of  nineteen  seventy-four  in  the  absence  of   this
      subdivision,  such  dwelling  unit  shall,  upon  the expiration of such
      benefits, continue to be subject to this chapter or the emergency tenant
      protection act of nineteen seventy-four to the same extent  and  in  the
      same manner as if this subdivision had never applied thereto.

Section 26-504.2 ::    
        
     
        * ยง  26-504.2  Exclusion  of  high  rent  accommodations.  a. "Housing
      accommodations" shall  not  include:  any  housing  accommodation  which
      becomes  vacant  on  or after April first, nineteen hundred ninety-seven
      and before the effective date of the rent act of 2011 and where  at  the
      time  the  tenant vacated such housing accommodation the legal regulated
      rent was two thousand dollars or more per month;  or,  for  any  housing
      accommodation  which is or becomes vacant on or after the effective date
      of the rent regulation reform act of 1997 and before the effective  date
      of  the  rent  act  of 2011, with a legal regulated rent of two thousand
      dollars or more per month. This  exclusion  shall  apply  regardless  of
      whether  the  next  tenant  in  occupancy  or  any  subsequent tenant in
      occupancy is charged or pays less than two thousand dollars a month; or,
      for any housing  accommodation  with  a  legal  regulated  rent  of  two
      thousand  five hundred dollars or more per month at any time on or after
      the effective date of the rent act of 2011, which is or  becomes  vacant
      on  or  after such effective date. This exclusion shall apply regardless
      of whether the next tenant in occupancy  or  any  subsequent  tenant  in
      occupancy  actually  is  charged  or  pays  less  than two thousand five
      hundred dollars a month. Provided however, that an exclusion pursuant to
      this subdivision shall not apply to housing accommodations which  became
      or  become  subject  to this law (a) by virtue of receiving tax benefits
      pursuant  to  section  four  hundred  twenty-one-a   or   four   hundred
      eighty-nine  of  the real property tax law, except as otherwise provided
      in subparagraph (i) of paragraph (f) of subdivision two of section  four
      hundred  twenty-one-a  of the real property tax law, or (b) by virtue of
      article seven-C of the multiple dwelling law.  This  section  shall  not
      apply,   however,  to  or  become  effective  with  respect  to  housing
      accommodations which the  commissioner  determines  or  finds  that  the
      landlord or any person acting on his or her behalf, with intent to cause
      the  tenant  to vacate, engaged in any course of conduct (including, but
      not limited to, interruption or  discontinuance  of  required  services)
      which  interfered with or disturbed or was intended to interfere with or
      disturb the comfort, repose, peace or quiet of the tenant in his or  her
      use  or  occupancy  of the housing accommodations and in connection with
      such course of conduct, any other general enforcement provision of  this
      law shall also apply.
        b.  The owner of any housing accommodation that is not subject to this
      law pursuant to the provisions of  subdivision  a  of  this  section  or
      subparagraph k of paragraph 2 of subdivision e of section 26-403 of this
      code  shall  give  written  notice  certified by such owner to the first
      tenant of that housing accommodation after  such  housing  accommodation
      becomes  exempt  from  the  provisions  of this law or the city rent and
      rehabilitation law. Such notice shall contain the last  regulated  rent,
      the reason that such housing accommodation is not subject to this law or
      the  city  rent  and rehabilitation law, a calculation of how either the
      rental amount charged when there  is  no  lease  or  the  rental  amount
      provided  for  in the lease has been derived so as to reach two thousand
      dollars or more per month or, for a housing accommodation with  a  legal
      regulated  rent  or maximum rent of two thousand five hundred dollars or
      more per month on or after the effective date of the rent act  of  2011,
      which  is or becomes vacant on or after such effective date, whether the
      next tenant in occupancy or any subsequent tenant in occupancy  actually
      is  charged  or pays less than a legal regulated rent or maximum rent of
      two thousand five hundred dollars or more per month,  a  statement  that
      the last legal regulated rent or the maximum rent may be verified by the
      tenant  by  contacting  the  state  division  of  housing  and community
      renewal, or any successor thereto, and the address and telephone  number
      of  such  agency, or any successor thereto. Such notice shall be sent by
    
      certified mail within thirty days after the tenancy commences  or  after
      the  signing  of  the  lease  by both parties, whichever occurs first or
      shall be delivered to the  tenant  at  the  signing  of  the  lease.  In
      addition,  the  owner shall send and certify to the tenant a copy of the
      registration statement for such housing  accommodation  filed  with  the
      state  division  of  housing  and community renewal indicating that such
      housing accommodation became exempt from the provisions of this  law  or
      the  city rent and rehabilitation law, which form shall include the last
      regulated rent, and shall be sent to the tenant within thirty days after
      the tenancy commences or the  filing  of  such  registration,  whichever
      occurs later.

Section 26-504.3 ::    
        
     
        * ยง  26-504.3  High  income  rent deregulation. (a) 1. For purposes of
      this section, annual income shall mean the federal adjusted gross income
      as reported on the New York state income tax return. Total annual income
      means the sum of the annual incomes  of  all  persons  whose  names  are
      recited  as  the  tenant  or co-tenant on a lease who occupy the housing
      accommodation  and  all  other   persons   that   occupy   the   housing
      accommodation  as  their  primary  residence  on  other than a temporary
      basis, excluding bona fide employees of such occupants residing  therein
      in connection with such employment and excluding bona fide subtenants in
      occupancy pursuant to the provisions of section two hundred twenty-six-b
      of  the  real property law. In the case where a housing accommodation is
      sublet, the annual income of the tenant  or  co-tenant  recited  on  the
      lease who will reoccupy the housing accommodation upon the expiration of
      the sublease shall be considered.
        2.  Deregulation  income  threshold means total annual income equal to
      one hundred seventy-five thousand dollars in each of the  two  preceding
      calendar years for proceedings commenced before July first, two thousand
      eleven.  For  proceedings commenced on or after July first, two thousand
      eleven, the deregulation income threshold means the total annual  income
      equal  to  two  hundred  thousand  dollars  in each of the two preceding
      calendar years.
        3.  Deregulation  rent  threshold  means  two  thousand  dollars   for
      proceedings  commenced  before  July  first,  two  thousand  eleven. For
      proceedings commenced on or after July first, two thousand  eleven,  the
      deregulation rent threshold means two thousand five hundred dollars.
        (b) On or before the first day of May in each calendar year, the owner
      of  each housing accommodation for which the legal regulated rent equals
      or exceeds the deregulation rent threshold may  provide  the  tenant  or
      tenants  residing  therein with an income certification form prepared by
      the division of housing and community renewal on which  such  tenant  or
      tenants  shall  identify  all  persons referred to in subdivision (a) of
      this section and shall certify whether the total  annual  income  is  in
      excess of the deregulation income threshold in each of the two preceding
      calendar  years.  Such  income  certification  form shall state that the
      income level certified to by the tenant may be subject  to  verification
      by  the  department  of  taxation  and  finance  pursuant to section one
      hundred seventy-one-b of the tax law and shall not require disclosure of
      any income information other than whether the  aforementioned  threshold
      has  been  exceeded.  Such income certification form shall clearly state
      that: (i) only tenants residing in housing accommodations which  have  a
      legal  regulated  monthly  rent, that equals or exceeds the deregulation
      rent threshold are required to complete  the  certification  form;  (ii)
      that  tenants  have  protections available to them which are designed to
      prevent harassment; (iii) that tenants are not required to  provide  any
      information regarding their income except that which is requested on the
      form   and  may  contain  such  other  information  the  division  deems
      appropriate.  The  tenant  or  tenants  shall   return   the   completed
      certification  to  the  owner  within thirty days after service upon the
      tenant or tenants.  In  the  event  that  the  total  annual  income  as
      certified  is  in excess of the deregulation income threshold in each of
      the two preceding calendar years, the owner may file  the  certification
      with  the  state  division of housing and community renewal on or before
      June thirtieth of such year. Upon filing  such  certification  with  the
      division, the division shall, within thirty days after the filing, issue
      an  order providing that such housing accommodation shall not be subject
      to the provisions of this act upon the expiration of the existing lease.
      A copy of such order shall be mailed  by  regular  and  certified  mail,
    
      return  receipt  requested,  to the tenant or tenants and a copy thereof
      shall be mailed to the owner.
        (c)  1.  In the event that the tenant or tenants either fail to return
      the completed certification to the owner on or before the date  required
      by   subdivision   (b)  of  this  section  or  the  owner  disputes  the
      certification returned by the tenant or tenants, the owner  may,  on  or
      before  June  thirtieth  of  such  year,  petition the state division of
      housing and community renewal to verify, pursuant to section one hundred
      seventy-one-b of the tax law, whether the total  annual  income  exceeds
      the  deregulation income threshold in each of the two preceding calendar
      years. Within twenty days after the filing  of  such  request  with  the
      division,  the  division shall notify the tenant or tenants named on the
      lease that such tenant or tenants must provide the  division  with  such
      information  as  the division and the department of taxation and finance
      shall require to verify whether the  total  annual  income  exceeds  the
      deregulation  income  threshold  in  each  of the two preceding calendar
      years. The division's notification shall require the tenant  or  tenants
      to  provide the information to the division within sixty days of service
      upon such tenant or tenants and shall include a warning  in  bold  faced
      type that failure to respond will result in an order being issued by the
      division  providing that such housing accommodation shall not be subject
      to the provisions of this law.
        2. If the department of taxation and finance determines that the total
      annual income is in excess of the deregulation income threshold in  each
      of  the  two  preceding calendar years, the division shall, on or before
      November fifteenth of such year, notify the owner  and  tenants  of  the
      results  of such verification. Both the owner and the tenants shall have
      thirty days within which to comment on such verification results. Within
      forty-five days after the expiration of the comment period, the division
      shall, where appropriate, issue an order  providing  that  such  housing
      accommodation  shall  not  be subject to the provisions of this law upon
      the expiration of the existing lease. A copy  of  such  order  shall  be
      mailed  by  regular and certified mail, return receipt requested, to the
      tenant or tenants and a copy thereof shall be sent to the owner.
        3. In the event the tenant or tenants fail to provide the  information
      required  pursuant  to  paragraph  one of this subdivision, the division
      shall issue, on  or  before  December  first  of  such  year,  an  order
      providing  that  such  housing accommodation shall not be subject to the

      does  not  exceed  the  maximum  income  above  which  such  head of the
      household would not be eligible to receive  cash  supplemental  security
      income  benefits under federal law during such tax year. For purposes of
      this subparagraph, "aggregate disposable income" shall not include gifts
      or inheritances, payments made to individuals because of their status as
      victims of Nazi persecution, as defined in P.L. 103-286, or increases in

        (iv) (a) in the case of a head of the household who does not receive a
      monthly  allowance  for shelter pursuant to the social services law, the
      maximum rent for the housing  accommodation  exceeds  one-third  of  the
      aggregate  disposable  income,  or  subject to the limitations contained
      within  item  (c)  of  subparagraph  (i)  of  paragraph  three  of  this
      subdivision,  if  any expected lawful increase in the maximum rent would
      cause such maximum rent to exceed one-third of the aggregate  disposable
      income; or
        (b)  in  the  case  of  a head of the household who receives a monthly
      allowance for shelter pursuant to the social services law,  the  maximum
      rent  for  the  housing  accommodation exceeds the maximum allowance for
      shelter which the head of the household is entitled to receive  pursuant
      to  the  social  services  law,  or subject to the limitations contained
      within  item  (c)  of  subparagraph  (i)  of  paragraph  three  of  this
      subdivision,  if  any expected lawful increase in the maximum rent would
      cause such maximum rent to exceed  the  maximum  allowance  for  shelter
      which the head of the household is entitled to receive.
        (3)  (i)  A  rent  exemption  order pursuant to this subdivision shall
      provide:
        (a) in the case of a head of the household  who  does  not  receive  a
      monthly  allowance for shelter pursuant to the social services law, that
    
      the landlord may not collect from the tenant to whom it is  issued  rent
      at  a  rate  in  excess  of either one-third of the aggregate disposable
      income, or the rent in  effect  immediately  preceding  the  eligibility
      date, whichever is greater; or
        (b)  in  the  case  of  a head of the household who receives a monthly
      allowance for shelter pursuant to the  social  services  law,  that  the
      landlord  may not collect from the tenant to whom it is issued rent at a
      rate in excess of either the maximum allowance  for  shelter  which  the
      head  of  the  household  is  entitled to receive, or the rent in effect
      immediately preceding the eligibility date, whichever is greater; and
        (c) that the landlord may collect from the tenant  increases  in  rent
      based  on  an electrical inclusion adjustment or an increase in dwelling
      space, services or equipment.
        (ii) Each such order shall expire upon termination of occupancy of the
      housing accommodation by the tenant to whom it is issued.  The  landlord
      shall  notify the department of finance in the case of a household whose
      eligibility for such order is based on the fact that the  head  of  such
      household  is  sixty-two  years  of  age or older, or such agency as the
      mayor shall designate in the case of a household whose  eligibility  for
      such  order  is  based  on the fact that the head of such household is a
      person with a disability, on a form to be prescribed by such  department
      or agency, within thirty days of each such termination of occupancy.
        (iii)  When  a rent reduction order is issued by the state division of
      housing and community renewal, the amount  of  the  reduction  shall  be
      subtracted  from the rent payable by the tenant specified in a currently
      valid rent exemption order issued  pursuant  to  this  subdivision.  The
      landlord  may  not  collect  from the tenant a sum of rent exceeding the
      adjusted amount while the rent reduction order is in effect.
        (4) Any landlord who collects, or seeks to collect  or  enforce,  rent
      from a tenant in violation of the terms of a rent exemption order shall,
      for  the  purposes  of all remedies, sanctions and penalties provided in
      this chapter, be deemed to have collected or  attempted  to  collect  or
      enforce, a rent in excess of the legal regulated rent.
        (5)  A rent exemption order shall be issued to each tenant who applies
      to the department of finance in the case of a tenant  who  is  sixty-two
      years  of age or older or to such agency as the mayor shall designate in
      the case of a tenant who is a person with a  disability,  in  accordance
      with  such  department's  or  agency's applicable regulations and who is
      found to be eligible under  this  subdivision.  Such  order  shall  take
      effect  on  the  first  day  of  the  first  month after receipt of such
      application by the department of finance or such  agency  as  the  mayor
      shall  designate,  except  that where there is any other increase in the
      legal regulated rent within ninety days of the  issuance  of  the  order
      increasing the tenant's maximum rent which a tenant is not exempted from
      paying,  the  rent  exemption  order  shall without further order of the
      department of finance or such agency as the mayor shall  designate  take
      effect  as  of  the effective date of said order increasing the tenant's
      rent including any retroactive increments collectible pursuant  to  such
      order.
        (6)  A rent exemption order shall be valid for the period of the lease
      or renewal thereof upon application by the tenant; provided,  that  upon
      any  such  renewal  application  being  made  by  the  tenant,  any rent
      exemption order then in effect with respect  to  such  tenant  shall  be
      deemed  renewed  until  such  time  as the department of finance or such
      agency as the mayor shall designate shall have found such tenant  to  be
      either eligible or ineligible for a rent exemption order but in no event
      for  more  than six additional months. If such tenant is found eligible,
      the order shall be deemed to have taken effect upon  expiration  of  the
    
      exemption.  In  the  event that any such tenant shall, subsequent to any
      such automatic renewal, not be granted  a  rent  exemption  order,  such
      tenant  shall  be  liable  to  the  owner for the difference between the
      amounts  the  tenant  has paid under the provisions of the automatically
      renewed order and the amounts which the tenant would have been  required
      to  pay  in  the  absence of such order. Any rent exemption order issued
      pursuant to this subdivision shall include provisions giving  notice  as
      to the contents of this paragraph relating to automatic renewals of rent
      exemption  orders  and  shall  include provisions giving notice that the
      tenant must enter into either a one or two year renewal lease  in  order
      to  be  eligible  for  a  rent  exemption.  The  notice that each tenant
      receives from the owner relating to the right to a renewal  lease  shall
      contain  similar information. Any application or renewal application for
      a rent exemption order shall also constitute an application  for  a  tax
      abatement  under  such section. The department of finance and such other
      agency as the  mayor  shall  designate  may,  with  respect  to  renewal
      applications  by  the  tenants  who  have  been  found eligible for rent
      exemption orders, prescribe a simplified form including a  certification
      of the applicant's continued eligibility in lieu of a detailed statement
      of income and other qualifications.
        (7)  Notwithstanding  any  other  provisions  of law, when a head of a
      household to whom a then current, valid rent exemption  order  has  been
      issued  under this chapter, chapter three or chapter seven of this title
      moves his or her principal  residence  to  a  subsequent  dwelling  unit
      subject  to regulation under this chapter, the head of the household may
      apply to the department of finance or such other  agency  as  the  mayor
      shall  designate  for  a rent exemption order relating to the subsequent
      dwelling unit, and such order may provide that the head of the household
      shall be exempt from paying that portion of the legal regulated rent for
      the subsequent dwelling unit which is the least of the following:
        (i) the amount by which the rent  for  the  subsequent  dwelling  unit
      exceeds  the  last rent, as reduced, which the head of the household was
      required to actually pay in the original dwelling unit;
        (ii) the last amount deducted from the maximum rent or legal regulated
      rent meaning the most recent monthly deduction for the applicant in  the
      original  dwelling  unit  pursuant  to this section or section 26-605 of
      this title; or
        (iii) where the head of the  household  does  not  receive  a  monthly
      allowance for shelter pursuant to the social services law, the amount by
      which  the  legal regulated rent of the subsequent dwelling unit exceeds
      one-third of the combined income of all members of the household.
        Such certificate shall be effective as of the first day of  the  month
      in  which  the  tenant  applied for such exemption or as of the date the
      tenant took occupancy of the  subsequent  dwelling  unit,  whichever  is
      later provided both occur after the effective date of this section.
        (8)  (i) When a dwelling unit subject to regulation under this chapter
      is later reclassified to a dwelling unit  subject  to  regulation  under
      chapter  three of this title, the eligibility of a head of the household
      to receive a rent increase exemption order  upon  such  reclassification
      shall  be governed by paragraph eight of subdivision m of section 26-405
      of this title.
        (ii) When a dwelling unit subject to regulation under this chapter  is
      later  reclassified  to  a  dwelling  unit  subject to the provisions of
      article II, IV, V or XI of the private housing finance law or subject to
      a mortgage insured  or  initially  insured  by  the  federal  government
      pursuant to section two hundred thirteen of the national housing act, as
      amended,  the  eligibility  of a head of the household to receive a rent
    
      increase exemption order upon such reclassification shall be governed by
      section 26-605.1 of this title.
        (9)  Notwithstanding any other provision of law to the contrary, where
      a head of household holds a current, valid  rent  exemption  order  and,
      after  the  effective  date  of  this  paragraph,  there  is a permanent
      decrease in aggregate disposable  income  in  an  amount  which  exceeds
      twenty  percent  of  such  aggregate disposable income as represented in
      such head of the  household's  last  approved  application  for  a  rent
      exemption  order  or for renewal thereof, such head of the household may
      apply for a redetermination  of  the  amount  set  forth  therein.  Upon
      application,  such amount shall be redetermined so as to reestablish the
      ratio of adjusted rent to aggregate disposable income which  existed  at
      the  time  of  approval of such head of the household's last application
      for a rent exemption order or for renewal  thereof;  provided,  however,
      that in no event shall the amount of adjusted rent be redetermined to be
      (i)  in  the  case  of  a  head  of the household who does not receive a
      monthly allowance for shelter pursuant to the social services law,  less
      than  one-third  of the aggregate disposable income; or (ii) in the case
      of a head of the household who receives a monthly allowance for  shelter
      pursuant  to such law, less than the maximum allowance for shelter which
      such head of the household is entitled to receive pursuant to the social
      services law. For purposes of this paragraph, a  decrease  in  aggregate
      disposable  income  shall  not  include  any  decrease  in  such  income
      resulting from the manner in which such income is calculated pursuant to
      any amendment to paragraph c of subdivision one of section four  hundred
      sixty-seven-b  of  the  real  property  tax  law,  any  amendment to the
      regulations of the department of finance made on or after the  effective
      date  of  the  local law that added this clause, or any amendment to the
      regulations of such other agency as the mayor shall designate made on or
      after October tenth, two thousand five. For purposes of this  paragraph,
      "adjusted  rent"  shall  mean  legal  regulated rent less the amount set
      forth in a rent exemption order.
        c. Tax abatement for properties subject to rent exemption order.
        (1) Tax abatement, pursuant to the provisions of section four  hundred
      sixty-seven-b  of  the  real  property  tax  law,  shall be granted with
      respect to any real property for which a rent exemption order is  issued
      under  subdivision  b  of  this  section  to  the  tenant of any housing
      accommodation contained therein. The rent  exemption  order  shall  also
      constitute the tax abatement certificate.
        (2)  The  real  estate  tax imposed upon any real property for which a
      rent exemption is issued, shall be reduced and abated by an amount equal
      to the difference between:
        (i) the sum of the maximum rents collectible under such orders, and
        (ii) the sum of rents that would be collectible from  the  tenants  of
      such housing accommodations if no exemption had been granted pursuant to
      subdivision b of this section.
        (3)  For  any  individual  housing  accommodation,  the  tax abatement
      computed pursuant to this subdivision shall be available with respect to
      a period commencing on the effective date of the initial rent  exemption
      order,  and  ending  on  the  expiration  date  of  such order or on the
      effective date of an order terminating the rent exemption.
        (4) Prior to the commencement of each fiscal year, the  department  of
      finance  shall  determine  the  total amount of taxes to be abated under
      this section with respect to each  property  for  which  rent  exemption
      orders granted to persons sixty-two years of age or older were in effect
      for  all  or  any  part  of  the  preceding  calendar year. Prior to the
      commencement of each  fiscal  year,  such  agency  as  the  mayor  shall
      designate  shall  determine and, if such agency is not the department of
    
      finance, shall notify the department of finance of the total  amount  of
      taxes  to be abated under this section with respect to each property for
      which rent exemption orders granted to persons with disabilities were in
      effect  for  all  or  any  part  of  the  preceding  calendar  year. The
      commissioner of finance shall make the  appropriate  adjustment  in  the
      real estate tax payable in such fiscal year.
        (5) Tax abatement pursuant to this section shall be in addition to any
      other  tax abatement authorized by law, but shall not reduce the tax for
      any fiscal year  below  zero.  In  the  event  that  the  tax  abatement
      certificate  authorizes  an  amount  of  deduction in excess of the real
      estate installment, then the balance may be applied  to  any  subsequent
      installment  until exhausted. In such a case the owner shall submit with
      his or her real estate tax bill and remittance, a verified statement  in
      such form as prescribed by the commissioner of finance setting forth the
      carry over amount and the amounts previously applied; provided, however,
      that at the request of the owner such balance shall be paid to the owner
      by  the  commissioner  of  finance  in  lieu  of  being  applied  to any
      subsequent installment, except where the owner  is  in  arrears  in  the
      payment  of  real estate taxes on any property. For the purposes of this
      paragraph, where the owner is a corporation, it shall be deemed to be in
      arrears when any of the officers, directors or  any  person  holding  an
      interest in more than ten percent of the issued and outstanding stock of
      such  corporation  is  in arrears in the payment of real estate taxes on
      any property; where title is held by  a  nominee,  the  owner  shall  be
      deemed  to be in arrears when the person for whose benefit such title is
      held is in arrears in the payment of real estate taxes on any property.
        d. Notwithstanding the  provisions  of  this  chapter,  a  tenant  who
      resides  in  a  dwelling unit which becomes subject to this chapter upon
      the sale by the city of New York of the building in which such  dwelling
      unit  is  situated  may  be  issued  a rent increase exemption order for
      increases in rent which occurred during ownership of  such  building  by
      the city of New York provided that such tenant would have been otherwise
      eligible  to receive a rent increase exemption order at the time of such
      increase but for the fact that such  tenant  occupied  a  dwelling  unit
      owned  by  the  city  of  New York and was therefore not subject to this
      chapter. Application for such rent increase exemption  orders  shall  be
      made  within one year from the date such building is sold by the city of
      New York or within one year of the effective  date  of  this  provision,
      whichever is later.

        * ยง  26-510 Rent guidelines board. a. There shall be a rent guidelines
      board to consist of nine members, appointed by the  mayor.  Two  members
      shall  be  representative  of  tenants,  two  shall be representative of
      owners of property, and five shall be public members each of whom  shall
      have  had at least five years experience in either finance, economics or
      housing. One public member shall be designated by the mayor to serve  as
      chairman  and  shall  hold no other public office. No member, officer or
      employee of any municipal rent regulation agency or the  state  division
      of  housing and community renewal and no person who owns or manages real
      estate covered by this law or who is an officer of any owner  or  tenant
      organization  shall serve on a rent guidelines board. One public member,
      one member representative of tenants and one  member  representative  of
      owners  shall  serve for a term ending two years from January first next
      succeeding the date of their appointment; one public member, one  member

      serve for terms ending four years from January first next succeeding the
      dates of their appointment. The chairman shall serve at the pleasure  of
      the  mayor. Thereafter, all members shall continue in office until their
      successors have been appointed and qualified. The mayor shall  fill  any
      vacancy  which may occur by reason of death, resignation or otherwise in
      a manner consistent with the  original  appointment.  A  member  may  be
      removed  by  the  mayor  for cause, but not without an opportunity to be
      heard in person or by counsel, in his or her defense, upon not less than
      ten days notice.
        b. The rent guidelines board shall establish annually  guidelines  for
      rent   adjustments,   and  in  determining  whether  rents  for  housing
      accommodations  subject  to  the  emergency  tenant  protection  act  of
      nineteen  seventy-four  or  this  law  shall be adjusted shall consider,
      among other things (1) the economic condition of  the  residential  real
      estate  industry  in  the  affected  area  including such factors as the
      prevailing and projected (i) real  estate  taxes  and  sewer  and  water
      rates,  (ii)  gross  operating  maintenance  costs  (including insurance
      rates, governmental fees, cost of fuel and labor costs), (iii) costs and
      availability of financing (including effective rates of interest),  (iv)
      over-all  supply  of  housing accommodations and over-all vacancy rates,
      (2) relevant data from the current and projected cost of living  indices
      for  the  affected area, (3) such other data as may be made available to
      it. Not later than July first of each year, the  rent  guidelines  board
      shall  file  with the city clerk its findings for the preceding calendar
      year, and shall accompany such findings with a statement of the  maximum
      rate  or  rates  of  rent adjustment, if any, for one or more classes of
      accommodations subject to this  law,  authorized  for  leases  or  other
      rental  agreements  commencing  on  the next succeeding October first or
      within the twelve months thereafter. Such findings and  statement  shall
      be published in the City Record.
        c.  Such  members  shall  be  compensated  on  a per diem basis of one
      hundred dollars per day for no more than twenty-five days a year  except
      that  the  chairman  shall  be  compensated  at  one hundred twenty-five
      dollars a day for no more than fifty days a year. The chairman shall  be
      chief  administrative officer of the rent guidelines board and among his
      or her powers and duties he or she shall have the authority  to  employ,
      assign  and  supervise  the  employees  of the rent guidelines board and
      enter into contracts for consultant services. The department of  housing
      preservation  and  development  shall cooperate with the rent guidelines
      board and may assign personnel and perform such services  in  connection
    
      with  the  duties  of  the  rent  guidelines  board as may reasonably be
      required by the chairman.
        d.  Any housing accommodation covered by this law owned by a member in
      good standing of  an  association  registered  with  the  department  of
      housing  preservation and development pursuant to section 26-511 of this
      chapter which becomes vacant for any reason, other  than  harassment  of
      the prior tenant, may be offered for rental at any price notwithstanding
      any  guideline  level  established  by  the guidelines board for renewal
      leases, provided the offering price does  not  exceed  the  rental  then
      authorized  by  the  guidelines  board  for such dwelling unit plus five
      percent for a new lease not exceeding  two  years  and  a  further  five
      percent for a new lease having a minimum term of three years, until July
      first,  nineteen  hundred  seventy,  at  which time the guidelines board
      shall determine what the rental for a vacancy shall be.
        e. With respect to hotel dwelling units, covered by this law  pursuant
      to section 26-506 of this chapter, the council, after receipt of a study
      from  the  rent  guidelines  board, shall establish a guideline for rent
      increases, irrespective of the limitations  on  amount  of  increase  in
      subdivision  d  hereof,  which  guideline  shall apply only to permanent
      tenants. A permanent tenant is an individual or family who at  any  time
      since  May thirty-first, nineteen hundred sixty-eight, or hereafter, has
      continuously resided in the same hotel as a principal  residence  for  a
      period  of  at  least  six  months.  On  January first, nineteen hundred
      seventy-one and once annually each succeeding year the  rent  guidelines
      board  shall  cause  a  review  to  be  made  of the levels of fair rent
      increases provided under this subdivision and  may  establish  different
      levels  of  fair  rent increases for hotel dwelling units renting within
      different  rental  ranges  based  upon  the  board's  consideration   of
      conditions  in  the market for hotel accommodations and the economics of
      hotel real estate. Any hotel dwelling unit which is voluntarily  vacated
      by  the  tenant thereof may be offered for rental at the guideline level
      for vacancies established by the  rent  guidelines  board.  If  a  hotel
      dwelling  unit  becomes  vacant  because  the  prior  tenant was evicted
      therefrom, there shall be no increase in the rental thereof  except  for
      such increases in rental that the prior tenant would have had to pay had
      he or she continued in occupancy.
        g.  From September twenty-fifth, nineteen hundred sixty-nine until the
      rate of permissible increase is established by the council  pursuant  to
      subdivision  e  of  this  section, there shall not be collected from any
      permanent hotel tenant any rent increase in excess of ten  percent  over
      the  rent  payable  for  his  or  her dwelling unit on May thirty-first,
      nineteen hundred sixty-eight, except for hardship  increases  authorized
      by the conciliation and appeals board. Any owner who collects or permits
      any  rent  to  be  collected  in excess of the amount authorized by this
      subdivision shall not be eligible to be a member in good standing  of  a
      hotel industry stabilization association.
        h.  The  rent  guidelines  board prior to the annual adjustment of the
      level of fair rents provided for under subdivision b of this section for
      dwelling units and hotel dwelling units covered by this law, shall  hold
      a  public  hearing or hearings for the purpose of collecting information
      relating to all factors set forth in  subdivision  b  of  this  section.
      Notice of the date, time, location and summary of subject matter for the
      public  hearing  or hearings shall be published in the City Record daily
      for a period of not less than eight days and at least  once  in  one  or
      more  newspapers  of general circulation at least eight days immediately
      preceding each hearing date, at the expense of the city of New York, and
      the hearing shall be open for  testimony  from  any  individual,  group,
      association or representative thereof who wants to testify.
    
        i. Maximum rates of rent adjustment shall not be established more than
      once   annually   for  any  housing  accommodation  within  the  board's
      jurisdiction. Once established, no such rate shall, within the  one-year
      period,  be adjusted by any surcharge, supplementary adjustment or other
      modification.

        * ยง 26-511 Real estate industry stabilization association. a. The real
      estate industry stabilization association registered with the department
      of  housing  preservation  and development is hereby divested of all its
      powers and authority under this law.
        b. The stabilization code heretofore promulgated by such  association,
      as  approved  by the department of housing preservation and development,
      is hereby continued to the extent that it is not inconsistent with  law.
      Such  code  may be amended from time to time, provided, however, that no
      such  amendments  shall  be  promulgated  except  by   action   of   the
      commissioner  of  the  division  of  housing  and  community renewal and
      provided further, that prior to the adoption of any such amendments, the
      commissioner  shall  (i)  submit  the   proposed   amendments   to   the
      commissioner  of  the department of housing preservation and development
      and  allow  such  commissioner  thirty  days   to   make   comments   or
      recommendations  on the proposed amendments, (ii) review the comments or
      recommendations, if any, made pursuant to clause (i) of this subdivision
      and make any revisions to the proposed amendments which the commissioner
      of the division of  housing  and  community  renewal  deems  appropriate
      provided  that  any  such  review and revision shall be completed within
      thirty days of receipt of such comments  or  recommendations  and  (iii)
      thereafter  hold  a  public  hearing  on  the  proposed  amendments.  No
      provision of such code shall impair or  diminish  any  right  or  remedy
      granted to any party by this law or any other provision of law.
        c.  A  code  shall  not  be adopted hereunder unless it appears to the
      division of housing and community renewal that such code
        (1) provides safeguards against unreasonably high rent increases  and,
      in  general,  protects  tenants  and  the  public interest, and does not
      impose any industry wide schedule of rents or minimum rentals;
        (2) requires owners not  to  exceed  the  level  of  lawful  rents  as
      provided by this law;
        (3)  provides  for  a  cash  refund or a credit, to be applied against
      future rent, in the amount of any rent overcharge collected by an  owner
      and  any penalties, costs, attorneys' fees and interest from the date of
      the overcharge at the rate of interest payable on a judgment pursuant to
      section five thousand four of the civil practice law and rules for which
      the owner is assessed;
        (4) includes provisions requiring owners to grant a one  or  two  year
      vacancy  or  renewal  lease  at  the option of the tenant except where a
      mortgage or mortgage commitment existing as  of  April  first,  nineteen
      hundred  sixty-nine,  provides  that the mortgagor shall not grant a one
      year lease;
        (5) includes guidelines with  respect  to  such  additional  rent  and
      related  matters  as,  for  example,  security  deposits, advance rental
      payments, the use of escalator  clauses  in  leases  and  provision  for
      increase in rentals for garages and other ancillary facilities, so as to
      insure  that  the level of fair rent increase established under this law
      will not be  subverted  and  made  ineffective,  provided  further  that
      notwithstanding  any  inconsistent  provision  of law, rule, regulation,
      contract, agreement, lease or other obligation, no owner, in addition to
      the authorized collection of rent, shall demand,  receive  or  retain  a
      security  deposit or advance payment which exceeds the rent of one month
      for  or  in  connection  with  the  use  or  occupancy  of   a   housing
      accommodation  by (a) any tenant who is sixty-five years of age or older
      or (b) any tenant who is  receiving  disability  retirement  benefit  or
      supplemental security income pursuant to the federal social security act
      for any lease or lease renewal entered into after July 1, 2002;
        (5-a)  provides  that,  notwithstanding any provision of this chapter,
      the legal regulated rent for any vacancy lease entered  into  after  the
    
      effective  date  of  this  paragraph shall be as hereinafter provided in
      this paragraph. The previous  legal  regulated  rent  for  such  housing
      accommodation  shall  be  increased by the following: (i) if the vacancy
      lease  is  for a term of two years, twenty percent of the previous legal
      regulated rent; or (ii) if the vacancy lease is for a term of  one  year
      the  increase  shall  be  twenty percent of the previous legal regulated
      rent less an amount equal to the difference between  (a)  the  two  year
      renewal  lease guideline promulgated by the guidelines board of the city
      of New York applied to the previous legal regulated rent and (b) the one
      year renewal lease guideline promulgated by the guidelines board of  the
      city  of  New  York  applied  to  the  previous legal regulated rent. In
      addition, if the legal regulated rent was not increased with respect  to
      such housing accommodation by a permanent vacancy allowance within eight
      years  prior  to a vacancy lease executed on or after the effective date
      of this paragraph, the legal regulated rent may be further increased  by
      an  amount equal to the product resulting from multiplying such previous
      legal  regulated  rent  by  six-tenths  of  one  percent   and   further
      multiplying  the  amount  of  rent  increase  resulting therefrom by the
      greater of (A) the number of years since  the  imposition  of  the  last
      permanent  vacancy  allowance, or (B) if the rent was not increased by a
      permanent vacancy  allowance  since  the  housing  accommodation  became
      subject  to  this  chapter,  the  number  of  years  that  such  housing
      accommodation has been subject to this chapter.  Provided  that  if  the
      previous  legal  regulated  rent was less than three hundred dollars the
      total increase shall be as calculated above plus one hundred dollars per
      month. Provided, further, that if the previous legal regulated rent  was
      at  least three hundred dollars and no more than five hundred dollars in
      no event shall the total increase pursuant to  this  paragraph  be  less
      than  one  hundred  dollars per month. Such increase shall be in lieu of
      any allowance authorized for the  one  or  two  year  renewal  component
      thereof,  but  shall  be  in  addition to any other increases authorized
      pursuant to this chapter including an  adjustment  based  upon  a  major
      capital  improvement,  or  a  substantial  modification  or  increase of
      dwelling  space  or  services,  or  installation  of  new  equipment  or
      improvements  or  new  furniture  or  furnishings  provided in or to the
      housing accommodation pursuant to this section. The increase  authorized
      in  this  paragraph  may  not  be  implemented more than one time in any
      calendar year, notwithstanding the number of vacancy leases entered into
      in such year.
        (6)  provides  criteria  whereby  the  commissioner   may   act   upon
      applications by owners for increases in excess of the level of fair rent
      increase  established  under  this  law  provided,  however,  that  such
      criteria shall provide (a) as to hardship applications,  for  a  finding
      that  the  level  of  fair rent increase is not sufficient to enable the
      owner to maintain approximately  the  same  average  annual  net  income
      (which shall be computed without regard to debt service, financing costs
      or  management  fees)  for the three year period ending on or within six
      months of the date of  an  application  pursuant  to  such  criteria  as
      compared with annual net income, which prevailed on the average over the
      period nineteen hundred sixty-eight through nineteen hundred seventy, or
      for  the  first  three  years of operation if the building was completed
      since nineteen hundred sixty-eight or for the first three  fiscal  years
      after  a  transfer  of  title  to a new owner provided the new owner can
      establish to the  satisfaction  of  the  commissioner  that  he  or  she
      acquired  title  to  the building as a result of a bona fide sale of the
      entire building and that the new owner is  unable  to  obtain  requisite
      records  for  the  fiscal  years  nineteen  hundred  sixty-eight through
      nineteen hundred seventy despite diligent efforts to  obtain  same  from
    
      predecessors  in  title  and  further  provided  that  the new owner can
      provide financial data covering a minimum of six years under his or  her
      continuous and uninterrupted operation of the building to meet the three
      year  to three year comparative test periods herein provided; and (b) as
      to completed building-wide major capital  improvements,  for  a  finding
      that such improvements are deemed depreciable under the Internal Revenue
      Code  and  that  the  cost  is to be amortized over a seven-year period,
      based upon cash purchase price exclusive of interest or service charges.
      Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein,  no  hardship
      increase  granted  pursuant  to  this paragraph shall, when added to the
      annual gross rents, as determined by the commissioner,  exceed  the  sum
      of,  (i) the annual operating expenses, (ii) an allowance for management
      services as determined by the commissioner, (iii) actual annual mortgage
      debt service (interest  and  amortization)  on  its  indebtedness  to  a
      lending  institution, an insurance company, a retirement fund or welfare
      fund which is operated under the supervision of the banking or insurance
      laws of the state of New York or the United States, and (iv)  eight  and
      one-half  percent  of  that  portion  of  the  fair  market value of the
      property which exceeds the  unpaid  principal  amount  of  the  mortgage
      indebtedness  referred  to in subparagraph (iii) of this paragraph. Fair
      market value for the purposes of this paragraph shall be six  times  the
      annual gross rent. The collection of any increase in the stabilized rent
      for  any  apartment  pursuant  to  this  paragraph  shall not exceed six
      percent in any year from the effective date of the  order  granting  the
      increase  over  the  rent set forth in the schedule of gross rents, with
      collectability of any dollar excess above said sum to be spread  forward
      in similar increments and added to the stabilized rent as established or
      set in future years;
        (6-a)  provides  criteria  whereby  as  an alternative to the hardship
      application provided under paragraph six of this subdivision  owners  of
      buildings  acquired  by  the same owner or a related entity owned by the
      same principals three years prior to the date of application  may  apply
      to  the  division  for  increases  in  excess of the level of applicable
      guideline increases established under this law based on a finding by the
      commissioner that such guideline increases are not sufficient to  enable
      the  owner  to  maintain  an  annual gross rent income for such building
      which exceeds the annual operating expenses of such building  by  a  sum
      equal  to  at least five percent of such gross rent. For the purposes of
      this  paragraph,  operating  expenses  shall  consist  of  the   actual,
      reasonable, costs of fuel, labor, utilities, taxes, other than income or
      corporate  franchise taxes, fees, permits, necessary contracted services
      and non-capital repairs, insurance, parts and supplies, management  fees
      and  other  administrative costs and mortgage interest. For the purposes
      of this paragraph, mortgage interest shall be deemed to mean interest on
      a bona fide mortgage including an allocable portion of  charges  related
      thereto.  Criteria  to be considered in determining a bona fide mortgage
      other than an institutional mortgage shall  include;  condition  of  the
      property,  location of the property, the existing mortgage market at the
      time the mortgage is placed, the term of the mortgage, the  amortization
      rate, the principal amount of the mortgage, security and other terms and
      conditions  of  the  mortgage. The commissioner shall set a rental value
      for any unit occupied by the owner or a person related to the  owner  or
      unoccupied  at  the  owner's  choice for more than one month at the last
      regulated rent plus the minimum number of guidelines increases or, if no
      such regulated rent existed or is known, the commissioner shall impute a
      rent consistent with other rents in the building. The amount of hardship
      increase shall be such as may be required to maintain the  annual  gross
      rent  income as provided by this paragraph. The division shall not grant
    
      a hardship application under this paragraph or  paragraph  six  of  this
      subdivision  for  a  period  of  three  years  subsequent  to granting a
      hardship  application  under  the  provisions  of  this  paragraph.  The
      collection  of  any  increase  in the rent for any housing accommodation
      pursuant to this paragraph shall not exceed six percent in any year from
      the effective date of the order granting the increase over the rent  set
      forth  in the schedule of gross rents, with collectability of any dollar
      excess above said sum to be spread forward  in  similar  increments  and
      added  to the rent as established or set in future years. No application
      shall be approved unless the owner's equity  in  such  building  exceeds
      five  percent  of:  (i)  the arms length purchase price of the property;
      (ii) the cost of any capital improvements for which the  owner  has  not
      collected  a surcharge; (iii) any repayment of principal of any mortgage
      or loan used to finance the purchase of  the  property  or  any  capital
      improvements  for which the owner has not collected a surcharge and (iv)
      any increase in the equalized  assessed  value  of  the  property  which
      occurred  subsequent  to  the  first  valuation  of  the  property after
      purchase by the owner. For  the  purposes  of  this  paragraph,  owner's
      equity shall mean the sum of (i) the purchase price of the property less
      the  principal  of  any mortgage or loan used to finance the purchase of
      the property, (ii) the cost of any capital  improvement  for  which  the
      owner  has  not collected a surcharge less the principal of any mortgage
      or loan used to finance said improvement, (iii)  any  repayment  of  the
      principal  of  any  mortgage or loan used to finance the purchase of the
      property or  any  capital  improvement  for  which  the  owner  has  not
      collected  a  surcharge, and (iv) any increase in the equalized assessed
      value of the property which occurred subsequent to the  first  valuation
      of the property after purchase by the owner.
        (7) establishes a fair and consistent formula for allocation of rental
      adjustment to be made upon granting of an increase by the commissioner;
        (8)  requires owners to maintain all services furnished by them on May
      thirty-first, nineteen hundred sixty-eight, or as otherwise provided  by
      law,  in  connection  with  the leasing of the dwelling units covered by
      this law;
        (9) provides that an owner shall not refuse to renew a lease except:
        (a) where he or she intends in good faith to demolish the building and
      has obtained a permit therefor from the department of buildings; or
        (b) where he or she  seeks  to  recover  possession  of  one  or  more
      dwelling  units  for his or her own personal use and occupancy as his or
      her primary residence in the city of New York and/or  for  the  use  and
      occupancy  of  a  member  of  his  or her immediate family as his or her
      primary residence in the city of New York, provided however,  that  this
      subparagraph  shall  not  apply where a tenant or the spouse of a tenant
      lawfully occupying the dwelling unit is sixty-two years of age or older,
      or has an impairment which results  from  anatomical,  physiological  or
      psychological  conditions, other than addiction to alcohol, gambling, or
      any controlled substance, which are demonstrable by medically acceptable
      clinical and laboratory diagnostic techniques, and which are expected to
      be  permanent  and  which  prevent  the  tenant  from  engaging  in  any
      substantial  gainful employment, unless such owner offers to provide and
      if requested, provides an equivalent or superior  housing  accommodation
      at  the  same  or lower stabilized rent in a closely proximate area. The
      provisions of this subparagraph shall only permit one of the  individual
      owners  of  any  building  to recover possession of one or more dwelling
      units for his or her own personal use and/or for  that  of  his  or  her
      immediate  family.  Any  dwelling unit recovered by an owner pursuant to
      this subparagraph shall not for a  period  of  three  years  be  rented,
      leased,  subleased  or  assigned  to  any person other than a person for
    
      whose benefit recovery of the dwelling unit  is  permitted  pursuant  to
      this  subparagraph or to the tenant in occupancy at the time of recovery
      under the same terms as the original lease. This subparagraph shall  not
      be  deemed to establish or eliminate any claim that the former tenant of
      the dwelling unit may otherwise have against the owner. Any such rental,
      lease, sublease or assignment during such period to any other person may
      be subject to a penalty of a forfeiture of the right to any increases in
      residential rents in such building for a period of three years; or
        (c) where the housing accommodation is owned by a  hospital,  convent,
      monastery,  asylum, public institution, college, school dormitory or any
      institution operated exclusively for charitable or educational  purposes
      on a non-profit basis and either:
        (i)  the  tenant's  initial tenancy commenced after the owner acquired
      the property and the owner requires the  unit  in  connection  with  its
      charitable  or  educational  purposes  including,  but  not  limited to,
      housing for affiliated persons; provided that with respect to any tenant
      whose right to occupancy commenced prior to July first, nineteen hundred
      seventy-eight pursuant to a written lease or  written  rental  agreement
      and who did not receive notice at the time of the execution of the lease
      that  his  or  her  tenancy  was subject to non-renewal, the institution
      shall  not  have  the  right  to  refuse  to  renew  pursuant  to   this
      subparagraph; provided further that a tenant who was affiliated with the
      institution  at  the  commencement  of  his  or  her  tenancy  and whose
      affiliation terminates during such tenancy shall not have the right to a
      renewal lease; or
        (ii) the  owner  requires  the  unit  for  a  non-residential  use  in
      connection with its charitable or educational purposes; or
        (d)  on  specified  grounds  set forth in the code consistent with the
      purposes of this law; or
        (e) where a tenant violates the provisions of paragraph twelve of this
      subdivision.
        (9-a) provides that where an owner has submitted to and  the  attorney
      general has accepted for filing an offering plan to convert the building
      to  cooperative or condominium ownership and the owner has presented the
      offering plan to the tenants in occupancy, any renewal or vacancy  lease
      may  contain  a provision that if a building is converted to cooperative
      or condominium ownership pursuant to an eviction plan,  as  provided  in
      section  three  hundred  fifty-two-eeee of the general business law, the
      lease may only be cancelled upon the expiration of three years after the
      plan has been declared effective, and upon ninety  days  notice  to  the
      tenant that such period has expired or will be expiring.
        (10)  specifically  provides that if an owner fails to comply with any
      order of the commissioner or  is  found  by  the  commissioner  to  have
      harassed a tenant to obtain vacancy of his or her housing accommodation,
      he  or she shall, in addition to being subject to any other penalties or
      remedies permitted by law, be barred thereafter  from  applying  for  or
      collecting  any  further rent increase. The compliance by the owner with
      the order of the commissioner or the restoration of the  tenant  subject
      to harassment to the housing accommodation or compliance with such other
      remedy  as  shall  be  determined  by the commissioner to be appropriate
      shall result in the prospective elimination of such sanctions;
        (11) includes provisions which may be peculiarly applicable to  hotels
      including  specifically  that no owner shall refuse to extend or renew a
      tenancy for the purpose of preventing a hotel  tenant  from  becoming  a
      permanent tenant; and
        (12)  permits  subletting  of  units  subject  to this law pursuant to
      section two hundred twenty-six-b of the real property law provided  that
      (a)  the  rental charged to the subtenant does not exceed the stabilized
    
      rent plus a ten percent surcharge payable to  the  tenant  if  the  unit
      sublet  was  furnished  with  the tenant's furniture; (b) the tenant can
      establish that at all times he or she has maintained the unit as his  or
      her primary residence and intends to occupy it as such at the expiration
      of  the sublease; (c) an owner may terminate the tenancy of a tenant who
      sublets or assigns contrary to the terms of this paragraph but no action
      or proceeding based on the non-primary residence  of  a  tenant  may  be
      commenced prior to the expiration date of his or her lease; (d) where an
      apartment is sublet the prime tenant shall retain the right to a renewal
      lease  and the rights and status of a tenant in occupancy as they relate
      to conversion to condominium  or  cooperative  ownership;  (e)  where  a
      tenant violates the provisions of subparagraph (a) of this paragraph the
      subtenant shall be entitled to damages of three times the overcharge and
      may  also  be  awarded  attorneys fees and interest from the date of the
      overcharge at the rate of interest payable on  a  judgment  pursuant  to
      section  five thousand four of the civil practice law and rules; (f) the
      tenant may not sublet the unit for more  than  a  total  of  two  years,
      including the term of the proposed sublease, out of the four-year period
      preceding  the termination date of the proposed sublease. The provisions
      of this subparagraph shall only apply to  subleases  commencing  on  and
      after July first, nineteen hundred eighty-three; (g) for the purposes of
      this paragraph only, the term of the proposed sublease may extend beyond
      the  term  of  the tenant's lease. In such event, such sublease shall be
      subject to the tenant's right to a renewal lease.  The  subtenant  shall
      have  no right to a renewal lease. It shall be unreasonable for an owner
      to refuse to consent to a sublease solely because such sublease  extends
      beyond  the  tenant's  lease;  and (h) notwithstanding the provisions of
      section  two  hundred  twenty-six-b  of  the  real   property   law,   a
      not-for-profit  hospital  shall  have  the  right  to sublet any housing
      accommodation leased by it to its affiliated personnel without requiring
      the landlord's consent to any such sublease and without being  bound  by
      the  provisions  of  subparagraphs  (b),  (c) and (f) of this paragraph.
      Commencing with the effective date  of  this  subparagraph,  whenever  a
      not-for-profit   hospital   executes  a  renewal  lease  for  a  housing
      accommodation, the legal regulated rent shall  be  increased  by  a  sum
      equal  to  fifteen percent of the previous lease rental for such housing
      accommodation, hereinafter referred to as a  vacancy  surcharge,  unless
      the  landlord  shall have received within the seven year period prior to
      the commencement date of such renewal lease  any  vacancy  increases  or
      vacancy  surcharges  allocable to the said housing accommodation. In the
      event the landlord shall have received any  such  vacancy  increases  or
      vacancy  surcharges during such seven year period, the vacancy surcharge
      shall be reduced by the amount received by any such vacancy increase  or
      vacancy surcharges.
        (13) provides that an owner is entitled to a rent increase where there
      has  been a substantial modification or increase of dwelling space or an
      increase  in  the  services,  or  installation  of  new   equipment   or
      improvements  or  new  furniture  or  furnishings  provided  in  or to a
      tenant's housing accommodation, on written tenant consent  to  the  rent
      increase.  In the case of a vacant housing accommodation, tenant consent
      shall not be required. The permanent increase  in  the  legal  regulated
      rent  for  the  affected housing accommodation shall be one-fortieth, in
      the case of a building with thirty-five or fewer housing accommodations,
      or one-sixtieth, in the case of a building with  more  than  thirty-five
      housing  accommodations where such permanent increase takes effect on or
      after September twenty-fourth, two thousand eleven, of  the  total  cost
      incurred  by  the landlord in providing such modification or increase in
      dwelling space, services, furniture, furnishings or equipment, including
    
      the cost  of  installation,  but  excluding  finance  charges.  Provided
      further  that  an  owner  who is entitled to a rent increase pursuant to
      this paragraph shall not be entitled to a further  rent  increase  based
      upon  the  installation  of  similar  equipment,  or  new  furniture  or
      furnishings within the  useful  life  of  such  new  equipment,  or  new
      furniture or furnishings.
        (14) provides that where the amount of rent charged to and paid by the
      tenant   is   less  than  the  legal  regulated  rent  for  the  housing
      accommodation, the amount of rent for such housing  accommodation  which
      may  be  charged upon renewal or upon vacancy thereof may, at the option
      of the owner, be based upon such previously established legal  regulated
      rent, as adjusted by the most recent applicable guidelines increases and
      any  other  increases  authorized  by law. Where, subsequent to vacancy,
      such legal regulated rent, as adjusted by  the  most  recent  applicable
      guidelines  increases  and  any other increases authorized by law is two
      thousand dollars or more per month or,  for  any  housing  accommodation
      which  is  or  becomes vacant on or after the effective date of the rent
      act of 2011, is two thousand five hundred dollars  or  more  per  month,
      such housing accommodation shall be excluded from the provisions of this
      law pursuant to section 26-504.2 of this chapter.
        d.  (1) Each owner subject to the rent stabilization law shall furnish
      to each tenant signing a new or renewal lease, a  rider  describing  the
      rights  and  duties of owners and tenants as provided for under the rent
      stabilization law of nineteen hundred sixty-nine. Such publication shall
      conform to the intent of section 5-702 of the  general  obligations  law
      and shall be attached as an addendum to the lease. Upon the face of each
      lease,  in  bold  print,  shall  appear the following: "Attached to this
      lease are the pertinent rules  and  regulations  governing  tenants  and
      landlords'  rights  under the rent stabilization law of nineteen hundred
      sixty-nine".
        (2) The rider shall be in a form promulgated by  the  commissioner  in
      larger  type  than  the  lease  and  shall  be  utilized  as provided in
      paragraph one of this subdivision.
        e. Each owner of premises subject to the rent stabilization law  shall
      furnish  to  each  tenant  signing a new or renewal lease, a copy of the
      fully executed new or renewal lease bearing the signatures of owner  and
      tenant  and  the  beginning  and  ending dates of the lease term, within
      thirty days from the owner's receipt of the new or renewal lease  signed
      by the tenant.

        * ยง  26-513  Application for adjustment of initial rent. a. The tenant
      or owner of a housing accommodation made subject  to  this  law  by  the
      emergency  tenant  protection  act  of nineteen seventy-four may, within
      sixty  days  of  the  local  effective  date  of  this  section  or  the
      commencement  of  the first tenancy thereafter, whichever is later, file
      with the commissioner an application for adjustment of the initial legal
      regulated rent for such  housing  accommodation.  The  commissioner  may
      adjust  such  initial  legal  regulated  rent  upon  a  finding that the
      presence of unique or peculiar circumstances  materially  affecting  the
      initial   legal   regulated  rent  has  resulted  in  a  rent  which  is
      substantially different from the rents generally prevailing in the  same
      area for substantially similar housing accommodations.
        b.  1.  The  tenant  of  a  housing  accommodation  that was regulated
      pursuant to the city rent and rehabilitation law or this  law  prior  to
      July  first,  nineteen  hundred seventy-one and that became vacant on or
      after January first, nineteen hundred seventy-four  may  file  with  the
      commissioner  within ninety days after notice has been received pursuant
      to subdivision d of this section, an application for adjustment  of  the
      initial legal regulated rent for such housing accommodation. Such tenant
      need only allege that such rent is in excess of the fair market rent and
      shall  present  such  facts which, to the best of his or her information
      and belief, support such allegation. The  rent  guidelines  board  shall
      promulgate  as soon as practicable after the local effective date of the
      emergency tenant protection act of nineteen seventy-four guidelines  for
      the  determination of fair market rents for housing accommodations as to
      which any application may be  made  pursuant  to  this  subdivision.  In
      rendering  a  determination  on  an  application  filed pursuant to this
      subdivision b the commissioner shall be guided by such guidelines and by
      the rents generally  prevailing  in  the  same  area  for  substantially
      similar  housing  accommodations.  Where the commissioner has determined
      that the rent charged is in excess of the fair market  rent  he  or  she
      shall,  in addition to any other penalties or remedies permitted by law,
      order a refund of any excess paid since January first, nineteen  hundred
      seventy-four  or  the date of the commencement of the tenancy, whichever
      is later. Such refund shall be made by the landlord  in  cash  or  as  a
      credit against future rents over a period not in excess of six months.
        2. The provisions of paragraph one of this subdivision shall not apply
      to  a  tenant  of  a  housing  accommodation for which the initial legal
      regulated rent is no greater than the maximum rent that would have  been
      in  effect  under  this  law  on December thirty-first, nineteen hundred
      seventy-three, or for the  period  commencing  January  first,  nineteen
      hundred  seventy-four and ending December thirty-first, nineteen hundred
      seventy-five as calculated pursuant to the city rent and  rehabilitation
      law  (if  no such maximum rent has been calculated for a particular unit
      for the period commencing January first, nineteen  hundred  seventy-four
      and  ending  December  thirty-first,  nineteen hundred seventy-five, the
      division of housing and community renewal shall calculate such a  rent),
      as  the case may be, if such apartment had not become vacant on or after
      January first, nineteen hundred seventy-four, plus  the  amount  of  any
      adjustment  which  would have been authorized under this law for renewal
      leases  or  other  rental  agreement,  whether  or  not   such   housing
      accommodation  was  subject  to  this  law,  for  leases or other rental

        * ยง  26-514  Maintenance  of  services.  In  order  to  collect a rent
      adjustment authorized pursuant to the provisions  of  subdivision  d  of
      section  26-510  of  this  chapter  an  owner  must  file with the state
      division  of  housing  and  community  renewal,  on  a  form  which  the
      commissioner  shall prescribe, a written certification that he or she is
      maintaining and will continue to maintain all services furnished on  the
      date  upon  which  the  emergency  tenant  protection  act  of  nineteen
      seventy-four becomes a law or required to be furnished by any state  law
      or  local  law,  ordinance  or regulation applicable to the premises. In
      addition to any other remedy afforded by law, any tenant  may  apply  to
      the  state division of housing and community renewal, for a reduction in
      the rent to the level in effect prior to its most recent adjustment  and
      for  an  order  requiring  services to be maintained as provided in this
      section, and the commissioner shall so reduce the rent if  it  is  found
      that  the  owner  has  failed to maintain such services. The owner shall
      also be  barred  from  applying  for  or  collecting  any  further  rent
      increases.  The  restoration  of  such  services  shall  result  in  the
      prospective elimination of such sanctions. The owner shall  be  supplied
      with  a copy of the application and shall be permitted to file an answer
      thereto. A hearing may be held upon the request of either party, or  the
      commissioner  may  hold  a  hearing  upon  his  or  her  own motion. The
      commissioner may consolidate the proceedings for two or  more  petitions
      applicable to the same building or group of buildings or development. If
      the  commissioner  finds  that  the  owner  has  knowingly filed a false
      certification, it shall, in addition to abating  the  rent,  assess  the
      owner  with the reasonable costs of the proceeding, including reasonable
      attorneys' fees, and impose a penalty not in excess of two hundred fifty
      dollars for each false certification. The amount  of  the  reduction  in
      rent  ordered  by  the  state  division of housing and community renewal
      under this subdivision shall be reduced  by  any  credit,  abatement  or
      offset  in  rent  which  the tenant has received pursuant to section two
      hundred thirty-five-b of the real property law, that relates to  one  or
      more conditions covered by such order.

        * ยง  26-515  Recovery  of  possession.  a. An owner seeking to recover
      possession pursuant to subparagraph (c) of paragraph nine of subdivision
      c of section 26-511 of this chapter shall notify the tenant in occupancy
      not more than one hundred fifty and not less  than  one  hundred  twenty
      days  prior  to  the  end  of  the tenant's lease term, by mail, of such
      owner's intention not to renew  such  lease  in  order  to  recover  the
      dwelling  unit for its charitable or educational purposes. The owner may
      give such notice within one hundred twenty days of the expiration of the
      tenant's lease term, provided it may not commence a  summary  proceeding
      to  recover the dwelling unit until the expiration of one hundred twenty
      days from the giving of such notice and,  provided,  further,  that  the
      tenant may remain in occupancy until the commencement of such proceeding
      at the same rent and upon the same terms and conditions as were provided
      in  his  or  her expired lease. The notice of intention not to renew the
      tenant's lease shall be accompanied by a notice on a form prescribed  by
      the  division  of  housing  and  community  renewal  setting  forth  the
      penalties to which an owner may be subject for his  or  her  failure  to
      utilize  the  tenant's  dwelling  unit for the charitable or educational
      purpose for which recovery of the dwelling unit is sought.
        b. If any  owner  who  recovers  a  dwelling  unit  pursuant  to  such
      subparagraph  (c),  or any successor in interest, utilizes such unit for
      purposes other than those permitted under such subparagraph,  then  such
      owner  or successor shall, unless for good cause shown, be liable to the
      removed tenant for three times the damages sustained on account of  such
      removal  plus  reasonable attorney's fees and costs as determined by the
      court, provided that such tenant  commences  such  action  within  three
      years  from  the  date of recovery of the unit. The damages sustained by
      such tenant shall be the difference between the rent paid by such tenant
      for the recovered dwelling unit, and the rental value  of  a  comparable
      rent  regulated  dwelling  unit  on  the open market. In addition to any
      other damage, the reasonable cost of removal of  the  tenant's  property
      shall be a lawful measure of damages.
        c.  Where  a  dwelling  unit  has  been  recovered  pursuant  to  such
      subparagraph (c) and within four years of such recovery is rented  to  a
      person  or  entity  for  purposes other than those permitted pursuant to
      such subparagraph (c), unless for good cause shown, the rent charged  by
      such  owner  or  any successor in interest for four years following such
      recovery shall not exceed the last regulated rent payable prior to  such
      recovery.
        d.  If  the  owner  is  found  by  the commissioner, to have recovered
      possession of a dwelling unit pursuant  to  such  subparagraph  (c)  and
      within  four  years  of  such  recovery  such  owner or any successor in
      interest shall have utilized such unit for  purposes  other  than  those
      permitted  pursuant  to  such  subparagraph  (c),  unless for good cause
      shown, the commissioner shall impose upon such  owner  or  successor  in
      interest, by administrative order after hearing, a civil penalty for any
      such violation. Such penalty shall be in an amount of up to one thousand
      dollars   for   each  offense.  Such  order  shall  be  deemed  a  final
      determination for the purposes of judicial  review.  Such  penalty  may,
      upon the expiration of the period for seeking review pursuant to article
      seventy-eight  of  the  civil  practice  law  and rules, be docketed and
      enforced in the manner of a judgment of the supreme court.

        * ยง  26-516  Enforcement  and procedures. a. Subject to the conditions
      and limitations of this subdivision, any owner of housing accommodations
      who, upon complaint of a tenant, or of the state division of housing and
      community renewal, is  found  by  the  state  division  of  housing  and
      community  renewal,  after a reasonable opportunity to be heard, to have
      collected  an  overcharge  above  the  rent  authorized  for  a  housing
      accommodation  subject to this chapter shall be liable to the tenant for
      a penalty equal to three times the amount  of  such  overcharge.  In  no
      event  shall  such  treble  damage  penalty be assessed against an owner
      based solely on said owner's failure to file a timely or proper  initial
      or  annual  rent  registration  statement. If the owner establishes by a
      preponderance of the evidence that the overcharge was not  willful,  the
      state  division  of  housing  and  community renewal shall establish the
      penalty as the amount of the overcharge plus interest. (i) Except as  to
      complaints  filed  pursuant  to clause (ii) of this paragraph, the legal
      regulated rent for purposes of determining an overcharge, shall  be  the
      rent  indicated  in  the  annual registration statement filed four years
      prior to the most recent registration statement, (or, if  more  recently
      filed,  the  initial  registration  statement)  plus  in  each  case any
      subsequent lawful increases and adjustments. Where the  amount  of  rent
      set  forth  in  the  annual rent registration statement filed four years
      prior to the most recent registration statement is not challenged within
      four years  of  its  filing,  neither  such  rent  nor  service  of  any
      registration shall be subject to challenge at any time thereafter.
        (ii)  As  to  complaints  filed  within  ninety  days  of  the initial
      registration of a housing accommodation, the legal regulated rent  shall
      be  deemed  to  be  the rent charged on the date four years prior to the
      date of the initial registration of the housing  accommodation  (or,  if
      the housing accommodation was subject to this chapter for less than four
      years,  the  initial legal regulated rent) plus in each case, any lawful
      increases and adjustments. Where the rent charged on the date four years
      prior to the date of  the  initial  registration  of  the  accommodation
      cannot be established, such rent shall be established by the division.
        Where  the  rent  charged  on the date four years prior to the date of
      initial registration of the housing accommodation cannot be established,
      such rent shall be established by the division  provided  that  where  a
      rent  is established based on rentals determined under the provisions of
      the local emergency housing rent control act such rent must be  adjusted
      to  account  for  no  less  than  the  minimum  increases which would be
      permitted if the housing accommodation were covered under the provisions
      of this chapter. Where the amount of rent set forth in the  annual  rent
      registration  statement  filed  four  years  prior  to  the  most recent
      registration statement is  not  challenged  within  four  years  of  its
      filing,  neither  such  rent  nor  service  of any registration shall be
      subject to challenge at any time thereafter.
        (1) The order of the state division of housing and  community  renewal
      shall  apportion  the  owner's  liability  between  or among two or more
      tenants found to have  been  overcharged  by  such  owner  during  their
      particular tenancy of a unit.
        (2) Except as provided under clauses (i) and (ii) of this paragraph, a
      complaint  under this subdivision shall be filed with the state division
      of housing  and  community  renewal  within  four  years  of  the  first
      overcharge alleged and no determination of an overcharge and no award or
      calculation of an award of the amount of an overcharge may be based upon
      an  overcharge having occurred more than four years before the complaint
      is filed. (i) No penalty of three times the overcharge may be based upon
      an overcharge having occurred more than two years before  the  complaint
      is  filed  or  upon  an  overcharge which occurred prior to April first,
    
      nineteen hundred eighty-four. (ii) Any complaint based upon  overcharges
      occurring  prior  to the date of filing of the initial rent registration
      as provided in section 26-517 of this  chapter  shall  be  filed  within
      ninety days of the mailing of notice to the tenant of such registration.
      This  paragraph  shall preclude examination of the rental history of the
      housing accommodation prior to the four-year period preceding the filing
      of a complaint pursuant to this subdivision.
        (3) Any affected tenant shall be notified of and given an  opportunity
      to  join  in  any complaint filed by an officer or employee of the state
      division of housing and community renewal.
        (4) An owner found to have overcharged may be assessed the  reasonable
      costs  and  attorney's fees of the proceeding and interest from the date
      of the overcharge at the rate of interest payable on a judgment pursuant
      to section five thousand four of the civil practice law and rules.
        (5) The order of the state division of housing and  community  renewal
      awarding  penalties  may, upon the expiration of the period in which the
      owner may institute a proceeding pursuant to  article  seventy-eight  of
      the  civil  practice law and rules, be filed and enforced by a tenant in
      the same manner as a judgment or not in excess of twenty percent thereof
      per month may be offset against any rent thereafter due the owner.
        b. In addition to issuing the specific orders provided  for  by  other
      provisions  of  this  law,  the  state division of housing and community
      renewal shall be empowered to enforce this law and the code by  issuing,
      upon  notice  and  a reasonable opportunity for the affected party to be
      heard, such other orders as it may deem appropriate.
        c. If the owner is found by the commissioner:
        (1) to have violated an order of the  division  the  commissioner  may
      impose  by  administrative  order  after hearing, a civil penalty in the
      amount of one thousand dollars  for  the  first  such  offense  and  two
      thousand dollars for each subsequent offense; or
        ** (2)  to  have  harassed  a  tenant  to obtain vacancy of his or her
      housing accommodation, the commissioner  may  impose  by  administrative
      order  after  hearing,  a  civil  penalty  for  any such violation. Such
      penalty shall be in the amount of two thousand dollars for a first  such
      offense  and  up  to ten thousand dollars for each subsequent offense or
      for a violation consisting of conduct directed at the  tenants  of  more
      than one housing accommodation.

      law  and  rules, be docketed and enforced in the manner of a judgment of
      the supreme court.
        d. Any proceeding pursuant  to  article  seventy-eight  of  the  civil
      practice  law  and  rules  seeking review of any action pursuant to this
      chapter shall be brought within sixty days  of  the  expiration  of  the

      accommodation is located.
        e.  Violations  of this law, or of the code and orders issued pursuant
      thereto may be enjoined by the supreme court upon proceedings  commenced
      by  the  state division of housing and community renewal which shall not

      inspections and designate officers to  hear  and  report.  The  division
      shall  safeguard  the  confidentiality of information furnished to it at
      the request of the person furnishing same, unless such information  must
      be  made  public in the interest of establishing a record for the future
      guidance of persons subject to this law.
        g. Any owner who has duly registered a housing accommodation  pursuant
      to  section  26-517 of this chapter shall not be required to maintain or
      produce any records relating to rentals of such accommodation  for  more
      than  four  years  prior  to  the  most  recent  registration  or annual
      statement for such accommodation.

      regulation,   provide  for  administrative  review  of  all  orders  and
      determinations  issued  by  it  pursuant  to  this  chapter.  Any   such
      regulation  shall  provide  that  if  a  petition for such review is not

      of such fees or may file a lien  upon  the  building  and  lot.  If  the
      payment  of  such  fees is not received by the city within sixty days of
      the date contained in the written notice requesting  such  payment,  the
      city  shall  provide  a second written notice to the owner setting forth
      the amount of fees due and owing the  city  and  a  demand  for  payment
      within thirty days thereof.
        (2)  If  such  payment  is  not made to the city within such time, all
      unpaid fees shall constitute a lien upon the premises and shall be filed
      in the office of the city collector as an entry of the account stated in
      the book in which such charges against the premises are to  be  entered.
      Such  lien  shall have priority over all other liens and encumbrances on
      the premises except for the lien of taxes and assessments.  However,  no
      lien  created pursuant to this subdivision against any premises shall be
      enforced against an owner or mortgagee of such premises who acquired  in
      good  faith  an  interest therein subsequent to the period for which the
      fee was imposed but prior to the creation of any such lien.
        (3) A notice pursuant to paragraph one of  this  subdivision,  stating
      the amount due and the nature of the charge, shall be mailed by the city
      collector,  within five days after such entry, to the last known address
      of the owner or agent.
        (4) If such charge is not paid within thirty days  from  the  date  of
      entry,  it  shall  be the duty of the city collector to receive interest
      thereon at the same rate as is imposed  on  a  delinquent  tax  on  real
      property,  to  be  calculated  to  the  date of payment from the date of
      entry.
        (5) Such charge and the interest thereon shall continue to  be,  until
      paid,  a  lien on the premises. Such lien shall be a tax lien within the
      meaning of sections 11-319 and 11-401 of this  code  and  may  be  sold,
      enforced or foreclosed in the manner provided in chapters three and four
      of title eleven of this code.
        (6)  The  provisions  set  forth in this subdivision shall be the sole
      remedy for the enforcement of this section.
        c. The provisions of subdivision a of this section shall be deemed  to
      have  been  in full force and effect as of April first, nineteen hundred
      eighty-four.

      industry stabilization association registered  with  the  department  of
      housing  preservation  and  development  is  hereby  divested of all its
      powers and authority under this law. The stabilization  code  heretofore
      promulgated  by  such  association,  as  approved  by  the department of
      housing preservation and development, is hereby continued to the  extent
      that it is not inconsistent with law. Such code may be amended from time
      to  time provided, however, that no such amendments shall be promulgated
      except by action of the commissioner of  the  division  of  housing  and
      community  renewal  and  provided further, that prior to the adoption of
      any such amendments, the commissioner  shall  (i)  submit  the  proposed
      amendments to the commissioner of the department of housing preservation
      and development and allow such commissioner thirty days to make comments
      or  recommendations on the proposed amendments, (ii) review the comments
      or recommendations,  if  any,  made  pursuant  to  clause  (i)  of  this
      subdivision  and make any revisions to the proposed amendments which the
      commissioner of the division of  housing  and  community  renewal  deems
      appropriate  provided  that  any  such  review  and  revision  shall  be
      completed  within  thirty  days  of  receipt   of   such   comments   or
      recommendations  and  (iii)  thereafter  hold  a  public  hearing on the
      proposed amendments. No provision of such code shall impair or  diminish
      any  right  or  remedy  granted  to  any  party by this law or any other
      provision of law.
        b. A code shall not be approved hereunder unless  it  appears  to  the
      commissioner  of  the  division of housing and community renewal that it
      provides for a cash refund or a credit  to  be  applied  against  future
      rent,  in  the  amount of the excess, if any, of rent paid since January
      first, nineteen hundred sixty-nine, over the permissible fair  increase,
      and  that it gives a hotel tenant the right to request a six month lease
      at the permissible rent rate within thirty days of the approval of  such
      code,  or, if his or her tenancy commences after such thirty day period,
      within thirty days of the commencement of his or her tenancy,  and  that
      is  in  compliance  with  the  standards  set  forth in subdivision c of
      section 26-511 to the extent such standards are applicable to the  hotel
      industry,  and  that it provides specifically that no owner shall refuse
      to extend or renew a tenancy for  the  purpose  of  preventing  a  hotel
      tenant from becoming a permanent tenant.
        c.  Each  landlord who is made subject to this law pursuant to section
      26-505 or 26-506 of this code shall furnish  to  each  permanent  tenant
      signing a new or renewal lease, a rider describing the rights and duties
      of  owners  and  tenants as provided under the rent stabilization law of
      nineteen hundred sixty-nine. Such rider shall be in a  form  promulgated
      by  the commissioner and shall conform to the intent of section 5-702 of
      the general obligations law and shall be in a print size larger than the
      print size of the lease to which the rider is attached.
