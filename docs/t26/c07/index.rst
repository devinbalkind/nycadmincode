      (a) Subject to the provisions of this chapter an eligible  head  of  the

      certificate entitling him or her to an exemption from increases  in  the
      maximum rent otherwise payable in one of the following amounts:
        (1)  where  the  eligible  head  of  the  household does not receive a
      monthly allowance for shelter pursuant to the social services  law,  the
      amount  by  which  increases  in  the  maximum  rent  subsequent to such
      persons' eligibility date have resulted in the  maximum  rent  exceeding
      one-third of the combined income of all members of the household for the
      taxable  period, except that in no event shall a rent increase exemption
      order tax abatement certificate become effective prior to January first,
      nineteen hundred seventy-six; or
        (2) where the eligible  head  of  the  household  receives  a  monthly
      allowance for shelter pursuant to the social services law, an amount not
      exceeding  that  portion  of  any increase in maximum rent subsequent to
      such person's eligibility date which  is  not  covered  by  the  maximum
      allowance  for shelter which such person is entitled to receive pursuant
      to the social services law.
        (b) Notwithstanding any other provision of  law,  when  a  head  of  a
      household  to whom the then current, valid tax abatement certificate has
      been issued under this chapter, chapter three or chapter  four  of  this
      title  moves  his  principal  residence  to  a  subsequent dwelling unit
      subject to this chapter, or which  is  or  was  subject  to  a  mortgage
      insured  or  initially  insured  by  the  federal government pursuant to
      section two hundred thirteen of the national housing  act,  as  amended,
      the  head  of the household may apply to the supervising agency, subject
      to the terms and conditions imposed by this chapter, for a tax abatement
      certificate  relating  to  the  subsequent  dwelling  unit,   and   such
      certificate  may  provide that the head of the household shall be exempt
      from paying that portion of the maximum rent for the subsequent dwelling
      unit which is the least of the following:
        (1) the amount by which the rent  for  the  subsequent  dwelling  unit
      exceeds  the  last rent, as reduced, which the head of the household was
      required to actually pay in the original dwelling unit;
        (2) the last amount deducted from the maximum rent or legal  regulated
      rent  meaning the most recent monthly deduction for the applicant in the
      original dwelling unit pursuant  to  this  section,  section  26-406  or
      section 26-409 of this title; or
        (3)  where  the  eligible  head  of  the  household does not receive a
      monthly allowance pursuant to the social services  law,  the  amount  by
      which  the  maximum  rent  or  legal  regulated  rent  of the subsequent
      dwelling unit exceeds one-third of the combined income of all members of
      the household.
        Such certificate shall be effective as of the first day of  the  month
      in  which  the  tenant  applied for such exemption or as of the date the
      tenant took occupancy of the  subsequent  dwelling  unit,  whichever  is
      later, provided both occur after the effective date of this law.
        (c)  Notwithstanding  any  other  provision  of  law and to the extent
      applicable to the provisions of this chapter,  any  renewal  application
      being  made  by  the  tenant pursuant to this section, any rent increase
      order then in effect with respect to such tenant shall be deemed renewed
      until  such  time  as  the  department  of  housing   preservation   and
      development  shall  have  found  such  tenant  to  be either eligible or
      ineligible for a rent increase exemption order but in no event for  more
      than  six additional months. If such tenant is found eligible, the order
      shall be deemed to have taken effect upon expiration of  the  exemption.
      In  the  event  that  any  such  tenant  shall,  subsequent  to any such
    
      automatic renewal, not be granted a rent increase exemption order,  such
      tenant shall be liable to his or her landlord for the difference between
      the amounts he or she has paid under the provisions of the automatically
      renewed  order  and the amounts which he or she would have been required
      to pay in the absence of such order. Any rent increase  exemption  order
      issued  pursuant  to this chapter shall include provisions giving notice
      as to the contents of this section relating  to  automatic  renewals  of
      rent exemption orders.
        (d)  notwithstanding any other provision of law to the contrary, where
      an eligible head of the household holds a current, valid  rent  increase
      exemption  order/tax abatement certificate and, after the effective date
      of this subdivision, there is a  permanent  decrease  in  income  in  an
      amount  which  exceeds  twenty  percent of such income as represented in
      such eligible head of household's last approved application for  a  rent
      increase  exemption  order/tax  abatement  certificate  or  for  renewal
      thereof,  such  eligible  head  of  the  household  may  apply   for   a
      redetermination  of the amount set forth therein. Upon application, such
      amount shall be redetermined so as to reestablish the ratio of  adjusted
      rent  to  income  which existed at the time of approval of such eligible
      head of the household's last application for a rent  increase  exemption
      order/tax  abatement  certificate  or  for  renewal  thereof;  provided,
      however, that in no event shall the  amount  of  the  adjusted  rent  be
      redetermined  to be (i) in the case of an eligible head of the household
      who does not receive a monthly allowance for  shelter  pursuant  to  the
      social  services law, less than one-third of income; or (ii) in the case
      of an eligible head of the household who receives  a  monthly  allowance
      for  shelter  pursuant to the social services law, less than the maximum
      allowance for shelter which such  eligible  head  of  the  household  is
      entitled to receive pursuant to law. For purposes of this subdivision, a
      decrease  in  income  shall not include any decrease in income resulting
      from the manner in which income is calculated pursuant to any  amendment
      to  paragraph f of subdivision one of section four hundred sixty-seven-c
      of the real property tax law or an amendment to subdivision f of section
      26-601 of this code made on  or  after  April  first,  nineteen  hundred
      eighty-seven.  For  purposes  of this subdivision, "adjusted rent" shall
      mean maximum rent less the amount set forth in a rent increase exemption
      order/tax abatement certificate.

      housing company shall remit such amount to the commissioner  of  finance
