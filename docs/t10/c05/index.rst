      subdivision a of this section, any city agency that owns or leases  data
      that  includes  personal  identifying  information  shall  disclose,  in
      accordance with the procedures  set  forth  in  subdivision  d  of  this
      section,  any  breach of security following discovery by a supervisor or

      protective measures necessary to restore the reasonable integrity of the
      data system, disclosure shall be made by at least one of  the  following

      of the breach and the identity of the victim, such disclosure  shall  be
      made by a mechanism of the agency's election, provided such mechanism is
      reasonably  targeted to the individual in a manner that does not further
      compromise the integrity of the personal information.
