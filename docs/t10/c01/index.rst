Section 10-108 ::    
        
     
        §  10-108  Regulation  of  sound  devices or apparatus. a. Legislative
      declaration. It is hereby declared that the  use  or  operation  of  any
      radio   device   or  apparatus  or  any  device  or  apparatus  for  the
      amplification of sounds from any radio, phonograph or other sound-making
      or  sound-producing  device,  or  any  device  or  apparatus   for   the
      reproduction  or  amplification  of  the human voice or other sounds, in
      front of or outside of any building, place or premises, or in or through
      any window, doorway or opening of  such  building,  place  or  premises,
      abutting  or  adjacent  to a public street, park or place, or in or upon
      any vehicle operated, standing or being in or upon  any  public  street,
      park  or  place, where the sounds therefrom may be heard upon any public
      street, park or place, or from any stand, platform or  other  structure,
      or  from  any  airplane or other device used for flying, flying over the
      city, or on a boat or on the waters within the jurisdiction of the city,
      or anywhere on or in the public streets, parks or places, is detrimental
      to the health, welfare and safety of the inhabitants  of  the  city,  in
      that  such  use  or  operation  diverts the attention of pedestrians and
      vehicle  operators  in  the  public  streets,  parks  and  places,  thus
      increasing  traffic  hazards  and causing injury to life and limb. It is
      hereby further declared that such use or operation disturbs  the  public
      peace  and  comfort  and  the  peaceful enjoyment by the people of their
      rights to use the public streets, parks and places for street, park  and
      other  public  purposes and disturbs the peace, quiet and comfort of the
      neighboring inhabitants. Therefore, it is hereby declared as a matter of
      legislative determination that the prohibition of such use or  operation
      for   commercial   or  business  advertising  purposes  and  the  proper
      regulation of such use and operation for all other purposes is essential
      to protect the health, welfare and safety  of  the  inhabitants  of  the
      city,  to  secure the health, safety, comfort, convenience, and peaceful
      enjoyment by the people of their rights to use the public streets, parks
      and places for street, park and other public purposes and to secure  the
      peace, quiet and comfort of the city's inhabitants. It is hereby further
      declared  as  a  matter of legislative determination that the expense of
      supervising and regulating the use and operation of such  sound  devices
      and   apparatus   for   purposes  other  than  commercial  and  business
      advertising purposes should be borne by the persons using  or  operating
      such devices and apparatus and that the requirement of a nominal fee for
      the  issuance  of  a  permit  for  such use and operation as hereinafter
      prescribed is intended to defray the expenses of regulating such use  or
      operation for the health, welfare and safety of all the people.
        b. Definitions. As used in this section:
        1.  The  term  "public  holidays"  shall mean those days expressly set
      forth in section twenty-four of the general construction law.

      sound-producing device, or any device or apparatus for the  reproduction
      or amplification of the human voice or other sounds;
        3. The phrase "to use or operate any sound device or apparatus in, on,
      near or adjacent to any public street, park or place," shall mean to use
      or operate or cause to be used or operated any sound device or apparatus
      in front or outside of any building, place or premises, or in or through
      any  window,  doorway  or  opening  of such building, place or premises,
      abutting on or adjacent to a public street, park or place, or in or upon
      any vehicle operated, standing or being in or on any public street, park
      or place, where the sounds  therefrom  may  be  heard  upon  any  public
      street,  park  or place, or from any stand, platform or other structure,
      or from any other airplane or other device used for flying, flying  over
    
      the  city,  or on a boat or on the waters within the jurisdiction of the
      city, or anywhere on the public streets, parks or places.
        c. Use and operation of the sound devices and apparatus for commercial

      apparatus, in, on, near or adjacent to any public street, park or place,
      unless such person shall have first obtained a permit to  be  issued  by
      the  police commissioner in the manner hereinafter prescribed and unless
      the police commissioner shall comply with the provisions of this section
      and the terms and conditions prescribed in such permit.
        e. Applications. Each applicant for a permit to use or operate a sound
      device or apparatus in, on, near or adjacent to any public street,  park

      complies with the provisions of this section, except for one or more  of
      the  reasons specified in subdivision g hereof or for non-payment of the
      fee prescribed in subdivision h hereof, or to prevent overlapping in the
      granting of  permits,  provided,  however,  that  a  permit  issued  for
      multiple  days shall be issued only for multiple days within a period of
      five consecutive calendar days and  only  at  the  same  location.  Each

      threat to the safety of pedestrians or vehicular operators;
    
        3. In any location where the commissioner, upon  investigation,  shall
      determine  that  conditions of overcrowding or of street repair or other
      physical conditions are such that the use of a sound device or apparatus
      will  deprive  the  public  of  the  right  to  the  safe,  comfortable,
      convenient  and  peaceful  enjoyment of any public street, park or place
      for street, park or other public purposes, or will constitute  a  threat

      location within fifty feet of any building that is lawfully occupied for
      residential  use.  The  distance  of  fifty  feet shall be measured in a

      state of New York, and the city of New York, without fee.
        i. Exceptions. The provisions of this section shall not apply  to  the
      use  or  operation  of  any  sound  device or apparatus by any church or

      and intends that it remain on the building.
        2.  "Commercial  building"  means  any  building  that is used, or any
      building a portion of which is used, for buying,  selling  or  otherwise

      to sealing. For the purpose of this subparagraph, any  violations  at  a
      place  of  business operated by a different person shall not be included
      in determining the number of violations of any subsequent operator of  a

      subsequent operator of such business did not  acquire  the  premises  or
      business  through an arm's length transaction as defined in subparagraph
      (c) of this paragraph or that the sale or lease was conducted, in  whole
      or  in  part, for the purpose of permitting the previous operator of the
      business who had been found guilty of violating paragraph  one  at  such
      premises  to  avoid  the  effect  of  violations  on  the  premises. The
      procedures provided for in subdivisions c, e, f, i,  and  j  of  section

      property, or a lease of any part thereof, or a sale of  a  business,  in
      good faith and for valuable consideration, that reflects the fair market
      value  of  such real property or lease, or business, in the open market,
      between two informed and willing parties, where  neither  is  under  any
      compulsion  to participate in the transaction, unaffected by any unusual
      conditions indicating a reasonable possibility that the  sale  or  lease
      was  made  for  the purpose of permitting the original operator to avoid
      the effect of violations on the premises. The following sales or  leases
      shall  be  presumed  not to be arm's length transactions unless adequate
      documentation is provided demonstrating that the sale or lease  was  not
      conducted,  in  whole  or  in  part,  for  the purpose of permitting the
      original operator to avoid the effect of violations on the premises:
        (i) a sale between relatives, which term shall mean, for  purposes  of
      this  paragraph,  a  person  and  his  or  her spouse, domestic partner,
      parent, grandparent, child, stepchild, or stepparent, or any person  who
      is  the  direct  descendant  of the grandparents of the person or of the
      spouse or domestic partner of the person;
        (ii) a sale between related companies or partners in a business; or
        (iii) a sale or lease affected by other facts  or  circumstances  that
      would  indicate  that  the sale or lease is entered into for the primary
      purpose of permitting the original  operator  to  avoid  the  effect  of
      violations on the premises.
        (d) For purposes of this paragraph:
        (i)  the  term  "department" shall refer to the department of consumer
      affairs;
        (ii) the term "commissioner" shall refer to the  commissioner  of  the
      department of consumer affairs;
        (iii)  the  term  "premises"  shall  refer to land and improvements or
      appurtenances or any part thereof; and
        (iv) companies shall be deemed "related"  if  an  officer,  principal,
      director, or stockholder owning more than ten percent of the outstanding
      stock  of  the  corporation  of  one  company is or has been an officer,
      principal, director, or stockholder owning more than ten percent of  the
    
      outstanding  stock  of  the  other,  but  companies  shall not be deemed
      related  solely  because  they  share  employees  other  than  officers,

      shall   be   acknowledged  immediately  upon  receipt  thereof  by  such
      authority. Nothing in this paragraph  shall  be  construed  as  granting
      immunity  from  prosecution  for  any  crime  or  offense except that of
      unlawful possession of such ammunition  or  ammunition  feeding  devices
      surrendered  as  herein  provided.  A  person  who  possesses  any  such
      ammunition or ammunition feeding devices as an executor or administrator
      or any other lawful  possessor  of  such  property  of  a  decedent  may
      continue to possess such property for a period not over fifteen days. If

      named person, provided such named person is licensed to or is  otherwise
      lawfully  permitted  to  possess  the same. If no request to deliver the
      property is received within two years of the delivery of  such  property
      to  such  official, he or she shall dispose of it in accordance with the
      provisions of section 400.05 of the penal law.

      subdivision.

      in a will, provided that, within fifteen days, such  person  either  (i)
    
      surrenders  such deceptively colored firearm, rifle, shotgun, or assault
      weapon  to  the  commissioner  for  disposal  in  accordance  with   the

Section 10-133 ::    
        
     
        § 10-133 Possession of knives or instruments. a. Legislative findings.
      It  is  hereby  declared and found that the possession in public places,
      streets and parks of the city, of large knives is a menace to the public
      health, peace, safety and welfare of the people of the  city;  that  the
      possession  in  public  places,  streets  and  parks  of such knives has
      resulted in the commission of many homicides,  robberies,  maimings  and
      assaults  of  and  upon  the  people  of  the  city; that this condition
      encourages and fosters the commission  of  crimes,  and  contributes  to
      juvenile  delinquency,  youth  crime  and  gangsterism;  that unless the
      possession or carrying in public places, streets and parks of  the  city
      of  such  knives without a lawful purpose is prohibited, there is danger
      of an increase in crimes of violence and other conditions detrimental to
      public peace, safety and welfare. It is further declared and found  that
      the  wearing  or  carrying of knives in open view in public places while
      such knives are not being used for a lawful purpose is  unnecessary  and
      threatening to the public and should be prohibited.
        b.  It  shall be unlawful for any person to carry on his or her person
      or have in such person's possession, in any  public  place,  street,  or
      park any knife which has a blade length of four inches or more.
        c.  It  shall  be unlawful for any person in a public place, street or
      park, to wear outside of his or her clothing or carry in open  view  any
      knife  with an exposed or unexposed blade unless such person is actually
      using such knife for a lawful purpose as set forth in subdivision  d  of
      this section.
        d.  The  provisions  of subdivisions b and c of this section shall not
      apply to (1) persons in the military service of the state  of  New  York
      when  duly authorized to carry or display knives pursuant to regulations

Section 10-134 ::    
        
     
        §  10-134  Prohibition  on  sale  of  certain  knives.  a. Legislative
      findings.  It is hereby declared and found that the possession in public
      places, streets and parks of the city, of folding knives which lock upon
      opening, is a menace to the public health, peace, safety and welfare  of
      the  people  of  the city; that the possession in public places, streets
      and parks of  such  knives  has  resulted  in  the  commission  of  many
      homicides,  robberies,  maimings  and assaults of and upon the people of
      the city, that this condition encourages and fosters the  commission  of
      crimes,  and  contributes  to  juvenile  delinquency,  youth  crime  and
      gangsterism; that if this situation is not addressed, then  there  is  a
      danger  of  an  increase  in  crimes  of  violence, and other conditions
      detrimental to public peace, safety and welfare. It has been found  that
      folding  knives with a blade of four (4) inches or more that locks in an
      open position are designed and used almost exclusively for  the  purpose
      of stabbing or the threat thereof. Therefore for the safety of the city,
      such  weapons  should be prohibited from sale within the jurisdiction of
      the city of New York.
        b. It shall be unlawful for any person to  sell,  or  offer  for  sale
      within  the jurisdiction of the city of New York, any folding knife with
      a blade length of four or more inches which is so constructed that  when
      it  is  opened  it  is  locked  in an open position and cannot be closed
      without depressing or moving a release mechanism.
        c. Exempt from this section are importers and exporters  or  merchants
      who  ship or receive locking folding knives, with a blade length of four
      or more inches, in bulk, which knives are scheduled to  travel  or  have
      travelled  in  the  course  of  international, interstate, or intrastate
      commerce to a point outside the city. Such bulk shipments  shall  remain
      in  their original shipping package, unopened, except for inspection and
      possible subdivision for further movement in  interstate  or  intrastate
      commerce to a point outside the city.
        d.  Violation of this section shall be an offense punishable by a fine
      of not more than seven hundred fifty dollars ($750) or  by  imprisonment
      not  exceeding fifteen days (15) or both such fine and imprisonment. Any
      person violating this section shall be subject to a civil penalty not to
      exceed one thousand dollars for each violation.
    
    
    
    
    
    
    

Section 10-134.1

Section 10-134.1 ::    
        
     
        §  10-134.1  Prohibition  on  sale  of  box  cutters  to persons under
      twenty-one years of age, open displays of box cutters  by  sellers,  and
      possession  of  box  cutters in a public place, or on school premises by
      persons under twenty-two years of  age.  a.  Legislative  findings.  The
      council  hereby  finds  that the number of school safety incidents which
      take place in the city's schools are disturbingly high and  are  rising,
      and  that  these incidents place students and staff at unacceptable risk
      of injury and disrupt  the  learning  environment.  Board  of  education
      statistics  reveal  that  for the first half of the 1994-95 school year,
      8,333 school safety incidents  occurred,  representing  a  27.6  percent
      increase  as  compared  with the same period in the prior year. Board of
      education statistics also reveal that  for  the  entire  1994-95  school
      year,  19,814  school  safety  incidents  were reported, representing an
      increase of 16 percent as compared to the prior school year.
        The council further finds that the board of education's school  safety
      statistics  reveal  that  over  2,000  box  cutters  and  other  similar
      implements were seized during the 1994-95 school year,  indicating  that
      these  instruments  have  become  the  "weapon  of choice" in the city's
      schools. These implements are used as weapons by students  as  they  are
      relatively  inexpensive,  readily available, and easily deployable. Used
      as weapons, box cutters and similar instruments can cause great injury.
        It is the council's belief that banning the sale  of  box  cutters  to
      minors  under  eighteen  years of age, requiring that those who sell box
      cutters ensure that they are not displayed in a  manner  that  increases
      opportunities  for  minors  to steal them, and banning the possession of
      box cutters by persons under twenty-two years of age on school premises,
      will significantly help in reducing the number of violent school  safety
      incidents  and in ensuring that schools are the safe havens of knowledge
      and education that children need and deserve.
        b. Definitions. For purposes of this section:
        (1) "Box  cutter"  means  any  knife  consisting  of  a  razor  blade,

      agent or a school staff person.
        f.  When  a  person is found to possess a box cutter while in a public
      place  in  violation  of  subdivision  e  of  this  section,  it  is  an
      affirmative defense that:
        (1)  such person is traveling to or from school premises, where it was
      or will be used for a valid instructional or school related purpose  and
      used  only  under  the  supervision  of  a  school staff member or other
      authorized instructor, and such person has not displayed the box  cutter
      in  a  menacing  or threatening manner, or in a manner that a reasonable
      person would believe manifests an intent to use such box  cutter  for  a
      criminal purpose; or
        (2)  such  person  is  traveling  to  or  from  his  or  her  place of

      such  employer's agent, and such person has not displayed the box cutter
      in a menacing or threatening manner, or in a manner  that  a  reasonable
      person  would  believe  manifests an intent to use such box cutter for a

Section 10-138 ::    
        
     
        § 10-138  Distribution  of  a Model Code of Conduct to participants in
      youth sports programs. a. Legislative findings and intent. Participation
      in youth sports programs  should  be  a  rewarding  experience.  Through
      sports   programs,   our   youth   learn  the  importance  of  teamwork,
      cooperation, effort, discipline  and  commitment.  Furthermore,  regular
      physical activity is the cornerstone of an active and healthy lifestyle.
      Unfortunately,  good  sportsmanship  is sometimes lacking on the part of
      coaches, parents, players, spectators  and  other  persons  involved  in
      youth   sports   programs,  resulting  in  the  creation  of  a  hostile
      environment for participants. The City Council finds that  in  order  to
      realize   the  full  potential  and  value  of  youth  sports  programs,
      participants in such programs should  follow  a  Code  of  Conduct  that
      reflects  principles  of  good sportsmanship at all youth sports events.
      Furthermore, the City Council finds that organizations  that  administer
      youth  sports  programs  should  have  the  option  of  banning coaches,
      parents, players, spectators and  other  participants  in  youth  sports
      programs  from  attending  youth sports events if they engage in certain
      egregious behavior at  such  events.  Additionally,  such  organizations
      should have the option of requiring individuals to complete some form of
      anger management counseling before being allowed to resume attendance at
      youth sports events.
        b. Definitions. For purposes of this section:
        (1) The term "youth" shall mean any person under the age of eighteen.
        (2)   The   term  "organization"  shall  mean  any  individual,  firm,
      partnership, trust, association, corporation or other entity.
        (3) The term "youth sports event" shall mean a  competition,  practice
      or  instructional  event involving one or more youth sports teams, where
      such youth sports teams utilize  city  facilities  and/or  receive  city
      funding.
        c.  Any  organization  that  administers  a  youth sports program that
      utilizes city facilities and/or receives city funding  shall  distribute
      the  following  Model  Code  of  Conduct  or  a  similar Code of Conduct
      containing guidelines for conduct of behavior to be  observed  at  youth
      sports  events to all coaches, parents and players participating in such
      sports program:
        Model Code of Conduct
        1.  All  officials,  coaches,   parents,   players,   spectators   and
      participants shall respect one another.
        2.   All   officials,   coaches,   parents,  players,  spectators  and
      participants shall respect officials' decisions.
        3.  All  officials,  coaches,   parents,   players,   spectators   and
      participants shall engage in fair play and abide by all game rules.
        4.   All   officials,   coaches,   parents,  players,  spectators  and
      participants shall refrain  from  engaging  in  taunting  of  officials,
      coaches,  parents, players, spectators or other participants by means of
      baiting or ridiculing.
        5.  All  officials,  coaches,   parents,   players,   spectators   and
      participants   shall   refrain  from  verbal  and/or  profane  abuse  of
      officials, coaches, parents, players, spectators or other participants.
        6.  All  officials,  coaches,   parents,   players,   spectators   and
      participants   shall  refrain  from  threatening  physical  violence  or
      engaging in any form of physical violence.
        7.  All  officials,  coaches,   parents,   players,   spectators   and
      participants shall win and lose with good sportsmanship and shall strive
      to make youth sports programs rewarding for all participants.
        d.  Any  organization  that  administers  a  youth sports program that
      utilizes city facilities or receives city funding shall  post  or  affix
      the  Model  Code  of  Conduct  or  a  similar Code of Conduct containing
    
      guidelines for conduct of behavior to be observed at youth sports events
      at the primary  facility  where  such  youth  sports  events  occur,  as
      practicable.
        e.  Any  organization  that  administers  a  youth sports program that
      utilizes city facilities  and/or  receives  city  funding  may  ban  the
      presence  at youth sports events of any official, coach, parent, player,
      spectator or other participant who (1) engages  in  verbal  or  physical
      threats or abuse aimed at any official, coach, parent, player, spectator
      or  other  participant,  (2)  initiates  a  fight  or  scuffle  with any
      official, coach, parent, player, spectator or other participant  or  (3)
      engages  in  repeated  and  egregious  violations  of  the Model Code of
      Conduct or similar Code of Conduct containing guidelines for conduct  of
      behavior to be observed at youth sports events, if the conduct occurs at
      or in connection with such youth sports event.
        f. In the event that any official, coach, parent, player, spectator or
      other  participant is banned from attending youth sports events pursuant
      to subdivision (e)  of  this  section,  such  person  may  petition  the
      organization  that imposed such ban for permission to resume attendance.
      Prior to being permitted to resume  attendance,  such  organization  may
      require  such  person to present proof of completion of anger management
      counseling or its equivalent.

Section 10-150 ::    
        
     
        § 10-150 Declaration and findings; election for non-public office. The
      council  hereby  finds that it is in the public interest to hold certain
      elections on days other than those which the vast majority of the people
      of the city respect as a day of worship and a day of rest.  The  holding
      of  elections  on  such  days of worship is unfair to those citizens who
      observe such days of worship in that  they  are  unable  to  participate
      fully  in  the  election  process  on an equal basis unless they violate
      their religious precepts. This poses a threat to the  free  exercise  of
      religion  and  equality  of access to the electoral process. The council
      further finds and declares that bigotry, prejudice and intolerance  will
      be discouraged if such elections are forbidden on those days of worship,
      and  that  holding elections on other days will permit the participation
      of a greater number of people.

      public  are  eligible  to  cast  a  vote by virtue of the fact that they

      not more than one hundred dollars, or imprisonment for not more than ten

      reasonably calculated  to  provide  emergency  medical  aid  to  injured
      persons.

        (1) "bicycle" shall have the same meaning as in section 19-176 of this
      code, and shall also mean any wheeled device  propelled  exclusively  by
      human  power as well as any motor-assisted device that is not capable of
      being registered by the New York state department of motor vehicles;
        (2) "business using a bicycle for commercial purposes"  shall  mean  a
      person,  firm,  partnership, joint venture, association, corporation, or
      other entity which engages in the course  of  its  business,  either  on
      behalf  of  itself or others, in delivering packages, parcels, papers or
      articles of any type by bicycle. Nothing contained in this section shall
      be construed as applying to persons under the age of sixteen who  use  a
      bicycle only to deliver daily newspapers or circulars.
        b.  A  business  using a bicycle for commercial purposes shall provide
      identification of  such  business  by  requiring  every  bicycle  to  be
      identified by affixing to the rear of each bicycle, bicycle seat or both
      sides  of the delivery basket, a metal or plastic sign measuring no less
      than three inches by five inches, with the name of the business  and  an
      identification number unique to that particular bicycle in lettering and
      numerals no less than one inch in height so as to be plainly readable at
      a  distance  of  not  less  than  ten  feet and maintaining same in good
      condition thereon. A sign is no  longer  in  good  condition  if  it  is
      missing  any  of  its  component  parts or is otherwise damaged so as to
      impair its functionality.
        c. Every business using a bicycle for commercial purposes must  assign
      to  every  bicycle  operator  employed  by  such  business a three digit
      identification  number.  Such  business  must  issue  to  every  bicycle
      operator  an  identification  card  which contains the name, three digit
      identification number and photo of the bicycle operator  and  the  name,
      address  and  telephone  number  of  the  business  by which the bicycle
      operator  is  employed.   Such   business   shall   ensure   that   such
      identification  card  is  carried  by  the  bicycle  operator while such
      bicycle operator is making deliveries, or otherwise riding a bicycle  on
      behalf  of  the  business,  and  such  bicycle operator shall carry such
      identification  card  while  operating  a  bicycle  on  behalf  of  such
      business.  Such  bicycle  operator  shall  be  required  to produce such
      identification upon the demand of an authorized employee of  the  police
      department   or   department  of  transportation  or  any  other  person
      authorized by law.
        d. Every business  using  a  bicycle  for  commercial  purposes  shall
      maintain  a  roster of bicycle operators employed by such business. Such

      employee  operating  a  bicycle  on behalf of such business, the date of
      employment and discharge of each such employee,  every  such  employee's
      three  digit  identification  number,  and  whether  such  employee  has
      completed  the  bicycle  safety  course  required  by  paragraph  3   of
      subdivision e of this section. The owner of any business using a bicycle
      for  commercial  purposes  shall  be  responsible  for  maintaining such
      roster. Such roster  shall  be  made  available  for  inspection  during
      regular and usual business hours or any other such time that such entity
      is  open  for  business  upon  request  of an authorized employee of the
      police department or department of transportation or  any  other  person
      authorized by law.
        e.  (1)  The  owner  of  any  business  using a bicycle for commercial
      purposes shall provide, at its own expense, protective headgear suitable
      for each bicycle operator. Such headgear shall:
        (i) meet the standards  set  forth  by  the  consumer  product  safety
      commission in title 16, part 1203 of the code of federal regulations;
    
        (ii) be readily available at each site of the business using a bicycle
      for commercial purposes for use by each bicycle operator; and
        (iii)  be  replaced  if  such headgear is no longer in good condition.
      Headgear is no longer in good condition if it  is  missing  any  of  its
      component   parts   or   is  otherwise  damaged  so  as  to  impair  its
      functionality.
        (2) Each bicycle operator shall wear protective  headgear  that  meets
      the  requirements  of  paragraph  1  of  this  subdivision  while making
      deliveries or otherwise operating a bicycle on behalf of such  business.
      The  term  "wear  such  protective  headgear"  means having the headgear
      fastened securely upon the head with the headgear straps.
        (3) Each bicycle operator shall be  required  to  complete  a  bicycle
      safety  course.  For  purposes  of this section, "bicycle safety course"
      shall mean information provided by  the  department  of  transportation,
      regarding safe bicycling and adherence to traffic and commercial bicycle
      laws.  Such  requirement  shall  include,  but  not  be  limited to, the
      following:

      to operating a bicycle on behalf of  a  business  using  a  bicycle  for
      commercial purposes;
        (ii)  Each  business  using  a  bicycle  for commercial purposes shall
      indicate on the roster required to be maintained  by  subdivision  d  of
      this  section  that  each bicycle operator employed by such business has
      completed such bicycle safety course;
        (iii) The owner  of  any  business  using  a  bicycle  for  commercial
      purposes  shall  ensure  that  all  bicycle  operators  employed by such
      business shall complete such bicycle safety course prior to operating  a
      bicycle  on  behalf  of  such  business,  shall maintain records of such
      operators' completion of such bicycle safety course, and shall make such
      records available for inspection during regular business  hours  or  any
      other  time  such  business  is  open  for  business  upon request of an
      authorized  employee  of  the  police  department   or   department   of
      transportation or any other person authorized by law; and
        (iv)  The  commissioner of transportation shall post on the department
      of transportation's website the content of  the  bicycle  safety  course
      required  by  this  section  on  or  before  the  effective date of this
      section.
        f. The owner of any business using a bicycle for commercial  purposes,
      notwithstanding  that  a bicycle may be provided by an employee thereof,
      shall provide at its  own  expense  and  ensure  that  each  bicycle  is
      equipped  with  a  lamp;  a  bell  or  other device capable of giving an
      audible signal from a distance of at least one  hundred  feet,  provided
      however  that  a  siren or whistle shall not be used; brakes; reflective
      tires or, alternately, a reflex reflector mounted on the spokes of  each
      wheel;  as  well as other devices or material in accordance with section
      1236 of the vehicle and traffic law.
        g. Any business using a  bicycle  for  commercial  purposes  shall  be
      responsible  for  the  compliance with the provisions of this section of
      any employees it shall retain. Violation of any  of  the  provisions  of
      this section by any such business, or of any of the rules or regulations
      that may be promulgated pursuant hereto, shall be a violation triable by
      a  judge  of  the  criminal  court  of  the  city  of  New York and upon
      conviction thereof shall be punishable by a fine of not  less  than  one
      hundred  dollars nor more than two hundred fifty dollars or imprisonment
      for not more than fifteen days or both such fine  and  imprisonment.  In
      addition,  any  business  using  a  bicycle for commercial purposes that
      violates any of the provisions of this  section  or  any  of  the  rules
      promulgated  pursuant  hereto shall be subject to a civil penalty of one
    
      hundred dollars. Any such business that violates  a  provision  of  this
      section  or rule promulgated pursuant hereto more than thirty days after
      such business has already violated the same provision or rule  shall  be
      subject  to  an  additional  civil penalty of two hundred fifty dollars.
      Such civil penalties may be in addition to any criminal penalty imposed,
      and  shall  be  recoverable  against  such  business  in  an  action  or
      proceeding  in  any  court  or tribunal of competent jurisdiction or the
      environmental control board.
        h. Any person who makes deliveries or otherwise operates a bicycle  on
      behalf  of  a  business  using a bicycle for commercial purposes without
      carrying the identification sign  required  by  subdivision  b  of  this
      section   or  without  carrying  the  identification  card  required  by
      subdivision  c  of  this  section  or  who   fails   to   produce   such
      identification  sign  or card upon demand pursuant to such subdivisions,
      or who fails to wear protective headgear required by  subdivision  e  of
      this  section  or the retro-reflective apparel required by subdivision i
      of this section, shall be  guilty  of  a  traffic  infraction  and  upon
      conviction  thereof  shall  be  liable  for  a  fine  of  not  less than
      twenty-five dollars  nor  more  than  fifty  dollars.  It  shall  be  an
      affirmative  defense  to  such traffic infraction that such business did
      not  provide  the  protective  headgear,  the  identification   or   the
      retro-reflective  apparel  required by subdivisions b, c, e or i of this
      section.  Such  traffic  infraction  may  be  adjudicated  by  such   an

      vest, or other wearing apparel on the upper part of such operator's body
      as  the outermost garment while making deliveries, or otherwise riding a
      bicycle on behalf of such business, the back  of  which  shall  indicate
      such   business'   name   and   such   bicycle   operator's   individual
      identification number as assigned pursuant  to  subdivision  c  of  this
      section in lettering and numerals not less than one inch in height so as
      to be plainly readable at a distance of not less than ten feet.
        j.  The  provisions  of  this  section  shall  be  enforceable  by  an
      authorized  employee  of  the  police  department   or   department   of
      transportation or any other person authorized by law.
        k.  A  business  using  a  bicycle  for  commercial purposes shall not
      possess any motorized scooter and shall not permit any employee of  such
      business to operate such a motorized scooter on behalf of such business.
      A  business  using a bicycle for commercial purposes shall be liable for
      any violation of section  19-176.2(b)  of  this  code  committed  by  an
      employee  of  such business while such employee is operating a motorized
      scooter on behalf of  such  business.  For  purposes  of  this  section,

      bin,  the name, address and telephone number of the provider of the bin.
      This information  shall  be  printed  in  characters  that  are  plainly
      visible. In no event shall a post office box be considered an acceptable
      address for purposes of this paragraph.
        2.  No  publicly  accessible  collection bin may be placed on any city
      property or property maintained by the city, or on any  public  sidewalk
      or roadway.

      the property owner's designated agent.
        4. In addition to penalties provided for in any  other  provisions  of
      law, in the event that a publicly accessible collection bin is placed on
      city  property,  or  property  maintained  by the city, or on any public
      sidewalk or roadway, the owner of  the  publicly  accessible  collection
      bin, if the address of such owner is ascertainable, shall be notified by

      requested, that such publicly accessible collection bin must be  removed
      within  thirty  days  from  the  mailing  of such notice. A copy of such
      notice,  regardless  of  whether  the   address   of   such   owner   is
      ascertainable,   shall  also  be  affixed  to  the  publicly  accessible
      collection bin. This notice shall state that if the address of the owner
      is not ascertainable and notice is  not  mailed  by  the  department  of

      bin within the designated time period will result  in  the  removal  and
      disposal  of the publicly accessible collection bin by the department of
      sanitation. This notice shall also state that if the  owner  objects  to
      removal on the grounds that the bin is not on city property, or property
      maintained by the city, or on any public sidewalk or roadway, such owner
      may  send  written  objection  to  the  department  of sanitation at the
      address indicated on the notice within twenty days from the  mailing  of
      such  notice  or,  if the address of such owner is not ascertainable and
      notice is not mailed by the department of sanitation, within twenty days
      from the affixation of such notice,  with  proof  that  the  bin  is  on
      private  property.  Proof  that  the  bin  is  on private property shall
      include, but not be limited to, a survey of the property prepared  by  a
      licensed  surveyor  that  is  certified  to  the  record  owner  of such
      property.
