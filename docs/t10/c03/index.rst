      provisions  of  this  chapter. No person or business enterprise shall be

      shotguns  and  (2)  has  possessed  such  licenses  and  engaged in such
      businesses for at least one year.
        b. No license shall be issued or  renewed  pursuant  to  this  section
      except by the police commissioner, and then only after investigation and
      finding  that  all  statements  in a proper application for a license or

        (1) of good moral character;
        (2)  who has not been convicted anywhere of a felony or of any serious

      dealer in firearms, dealer in rifles and shotguns and, in the case of an
      application   for  renewal,  special  theatrical  dealer,  in  the  year
      preceding the application for such license or renewal, was  earned  from
      the  lease  for  theatrical purposes of such ammunition feeding devices,
      firearms, rifles, shotguns or  assault  weapons  as  the  applicant  was
      authorized  to  lease.  No  applicant  for a special theatrical dealer's
      license or renewal thereof shall  be  issued  such  license  or  renewal
      unless the gross income earned by the applicant as a dealer in firearms,
      dealer  in  rifles  and  shotguns and, in the case of an application for
      renewal,  special  theatrical  dealer,  in  the   year   preceding   the
      application  for  such  license  or  renewal,  exceeded  fifty  thousand
      dollars.
    
        d. An application for a license or renewal thereof shall  be  made  to
      the  police  commissioner.  An  application shall include the full name,
      date  of  birth,  residence,  present  occupation  of  each  person   or

      integrity of each person  or  individual  signing  the  application.  An
      application  shall  be  signed  and  affirmed  by  the  applicant.  Each
      individual signing an application shall submit one photograph of himself
      or herself and a duplicate for each required copy  of  the  application.
      Such  photographs  shall  have  been  taken  within thirty days prior to
      filing the application. The photographs submitted shall  be  two  inches
      square,  and the application shall also state the previous occupation of
      each individual signing the same and the location of the place  of  such
      business,  or  of the bureau, agency, subagency, office or branch office
      for which the license is sought, indicating the street  and  number  and
      otherwise  giving  such  apt  description as to point out reasonably the
      location  thereof.  In  such  case,  if  the  applicant  is  a  business
      enterprise,  its  name, date and place of formation, and principal place
      of business shall be stated. For a partnership, the application shall be
      signed and affirmed by each partner, and  for  a  corporation,  by  each
      officer thereof.
        With respect to an application for a license as a dealer in rifles and
      shotguns or as a special theatrical dealer, a written statement shall be
      submitted  by  the  individual  applicant,  or in the case of a business
      enterprise a responsible officer  or  agent  thereof,  stating  (a)  the
      identification  number  of  the  shotgun  and rifle permit issued to the
      individual applicant or the responsible officer or agent in the case  of
      a  business  enterprise,  (b) the address of a regular place of business
      maintained by the applicant, (c) that since the issuance  of  the  rifle
      and  shotgun  permit  the individual applicant or responsible officer or
      agent has not become disqualified for issuance of  such  a  permit,  (d)
      that he or she undertakes to supervise the acts of his or her, or in the
      case of a business enterprise, its employees, (e) that the applicant has
      not previously been refused a license as a dealer in shotguns and rifles
      or as a special theatrical dealer and that no such license issued to the
      applicant has ever been revoked.
        e.  Before  a  license  is  issued  or  renewed,  there  shall  be  an
      investigation of all statements  required  in  the  application  by  the
      police  department.  For  that purpose, the records of the department of
      mental hygiene concerning previous or  present  mental  illness  of  the
      applicant shall be available for inspection by the investigating officer
      of  the  police  department. In order to ascertain any previous criminal
      record, the  investigating  officer  shall  take  the  fingerprints  and
      physical  descriptive  data  in quadruplicate of each individual by whom
      the application is signed. Two copies  of  such  fingerprints  shall  be
      taken  on  standard  fingerprint cards eight inches square, and one copy
      may be taken on a card supplied for that purpose by the  federal  bureau
      of  investigation.  When  completed, one standard card shall be promptly
      submitted to the division of criminal justice services where it shall be
      appropriately processed. A second standard card, or the one supplied  by
      the  federal  bureau  of  investigation,  as  the  case may be, shall be
      forwarded to that bureau at Washington with a request that the files  of
      the  bureau be searched and notification of the results of the search be
      made to the police department. The failure or  refusal  of  the  federal
      bureau  of  investigation  to make the fingerprint check provided for in
      this section shall not constitute the sole basis for refusal to issue  a
    
      license pursuant to the provisions of this section. Of the remaining two
      fingerprint  cards,  one  shall  be filed with the executive department,
      division of state police, Albany, within ten days after issuance of  the
      license,  and  the  other  remain on file with the police department. No
      such fingerprints may be inspected by any  person  other  than  a  peace
      officer,  when acting pursuant to his or her special duties, or a police
      officer except on order of a judge or  justice  of  a  court  of  record
      either  upon  notice  to the licensee or without notice, as the judge or
      justice may deem appropriate. Upon completion of the investigation,  the
      police  department  shall report the results to the commissioner without
      unnecessary delay.
        f. Applications shall indicate and licenses  shall  be  issued  for  a
      gunsmith,   a  wholesale  manufacturer  of  firearms,  an  assembler  of
      firearms, a dealer in firearms, a dealer in rifles  and  shotguns  or  a
      special theatrical dealer.
        g.  The  application  for  any  license, if granted, shall be a public
      record. Such application shall be kept on file  in  the  office  of  the
      police  commissioner  and,  within  ten  days  after  the  issuance of a
      license, a duplicate copy shall be filed in  the  executive  department,
      division of state police, Albany.
        h.  No  license shall be transferable to any other person or premises.
      The license shall mention and describe the  premises  for  which  it  is
      issued and shall be valid only for such premises.
        i.  A  license  issued  pursuant  to this section shall be prominently
      displayed on the licensed premises. Failure of any  person  or  business
      enterprise  to  so  exhibit or display such license shall be presumptive
      evidence that the person or business enterprise is not duly licensed.
        j. Any license or renewal issued pursuant to this section shall expire
      on the first day of the second January following the date  of  issuance.
      Any application to renew a license that has not previously expired, been
      revoked  or cancelled shall thereby extend the term of the license until
      disposition is made of the application by the police commissioner.
        k. The conviction of a licensee anywhere of  a  felony  or  a  serious
      offense  shall operate as a revocation of the license. Written notice of
      such revocation shall be forwarded to the executive  division  of  state
      police in Albany.
        l.  The police commissioner, upon evidence of any disqualification set
      forth in subdivision b of this section,  may  at  any  time  suspend  or
      revoke  and  cancel  a  license issued pursuant to this section. Written
      notice of such suspension  or  revocation  shall  be  forwarded  to  the
      executive department, division of state police, Albany.
        m.  No  license  shall  be  issued pursuant to this section unless the
      applicant therefor possesses and exhibits all  licenses  required  under
      any federal or state law.
        n.  Records.  (1) Any person licensed under this section shall keep an
      accurate book record of every transaction involving a  firearm,  machine
      gun,  rifle, shotgun or assault weapon. Such record shall be kept in the
      manner prescribed and contain the information  required  by  the  police
      commissioner.
        (2)  The  records  required  by  this  section  shall  be  subject  to
      inspection at all times  by  members  of  the  police  department.  Such
      records  shall  be maintained on the premises mentioned and described in
      the license, and preserved for  record.  In  the  event  of  suspension,
      cancellation  or  revocation of a license, or discontinuance of business
      by a licensee, such record  shall  be  immediately  surrendered  to  the
      police commissioner.
        (3)  Any person licensed under this section as a dealer in firearms or
      special theatrical dealer shall cause a physical inventory to  be  taken
    
      within  the  first five business days of April and October of each year,
      which shall include a listing of  each  firearm  by  make,  caliber  and
      serial  number.  The  original  copy of such inventory shall be securely
      maintained on the premises for which the license was issued. One or more
      additional   copies   shall  be  forwarded  to  such  addresses  as  the
      commissioner may direct, by such means as the commissioner may direct.
        (4) With each copy of the inventory required under paragraph three  of
      this  subdivision  shall be included an affidavit signed by the licensee
      (or, if the licensee is not a natural person,  by  an  officer,  general
      manager,  or other principal of the licensee) stating under penalties of
      perjury that within the first  five  business  days  of  that  April  or
      October,  as  the  case  may  be, the signer has personally observed the
      firearms reported. The  affidavit  shall  also  describe  the  date  and
      contents of any report required to be made pursuant to section 400.10 of
      the penal law.
        (5)  In addition to the penalties specified in section 10-310, any act
      or omission that constitutes a violation of this subdivision or of rules
      and regulations issued by the commissioner  pursuant  thereto  shall  be
      grounds  for  the  revocation  of  a  license issued by the commissioner
      pursuant to this section.
        o. Rules and regulations. (1) The police  commissioner  may  make  and
      promulgate such rules and regulations regarding the issuance and renewal
      of  such  licenses  and  the reporting of inventory of firearms, loss of
      firearms, and theft of firearms and may  prescribe  such  forms  as  are
      necessary to carry out the provisions of this section.
        (2)  Such  rules  and regulations shall prescribe reasonable standards
      and conditions  under  which  firearms,  component  parts  of  firearms,
      rifles,  shotguns,  assault  weapons and ammunition shall be kept at the
      store or premises of gunsmiths,  including  store  and  plant  security,
      employment,   record   keeping  and  product  quality  control  for  the
      protection of the public  safety,  health  and  welfare.  The  foregoing
      enumeration  shall  not  be  construed  as  a  limitation  of the police
      commissioner's authority to promulgate rules and regulations hereunder.
        (3) The violation of such rules and regulations shall be triable by  a
      judge  of  the  criminal court of the city of New York and punishable by
      not more than thirty days imprisonment or by a fine  of  not  more  than
      fifty dollars, or both.

      shall be punishable as a class A misdemeanor.
        r.  No dealer in rifles and shotguns may dispose of a rifle or shotgun
      to any person unless such person produces  a  valid  rifle  and  shotgun
      permit, or proof of lawful authority as a police or peace officer, or is
      an exempt person as provided in this chapter.
        s.  Any  suspension, denial or revocation of a license may be appealed
      by the applicant or licensee pursuant to procedures established  by  the
      police commissioner for administrative review.

      or  shotgun  if  such  person has acquired a rifle or shotgun within the
      previous ninety days. For purposes of this subdivision when  a  firearm,

      entity, it shall be considered to have been  acquired  by  each  natural
      person  who  is  an officer, director or other principal of such entity,
      unless the firearm, rifle or shotgun  is  acquired  on  behalf  of  such
      entity  by a person who is licensed by the commissioner as gun custodian
      or special gun custodian, or  acquired  on  behalf  of  an  organization
      possessing  an organization registration certificate, as those terms are
      used in title thirty-eight of the rules of the city of New York.
        c. Before disposing of any firearm,  rifle  or  shotgun  to  a  person
      licensed  by  the  commissioner to possess firearms, rifles or shotguns,

      shall  contact  the  police  department  to  ensure  compliance with the
      requirements of this section.
        d. Any dealer in firearms, dealer in  rifles  and  shotguns  or  other
      person  who  disposes  of  any  firearm,  rifle  or  shotgun to a person
      licensed  by  an  authority  other  than  the  commissioner  to  possess
      firearms,  rifles  or  shotguns shall make reasonable efforts to contact
      such licensing authority and  to  ascertain  the  most  recent  date  of
      acquisition by such licensee of a firearm, in the case of disposition of
      a  firearm,  or  of  a rifle or shotgun, in the case of disposition of a
      rifle or shotgun.
        e. Any dealer in firearms or dealer in rifles or shotguns who disposes
      of any firearm, rifle or  shotgun  shall,  before  or  at  the  time  of
      disposing  of such firearm, rifle or shotgun, record, in the record book
      required to be kept by subdivision n of section 10-302, the efforts made
      by such dealer to  ensure  compliance  with  the  requirements  of  this
      section,  any exception or exemption set forth in this section that such
      dealer reasonably believes would authorize the disposal of such firearm,
      rifle or shotgun, and the grounds for such  dealer's  belief  that  such
      exception or exemption applies.
        f.  Exceptions.  The provisions of this section shall not apply to the

      shotguns only, organizations  possessing  an  organization  registration
      certificate,  as that term is used in title thirty-eight of the rules of
      the city of New York.
        g. Exempt transactions. The requirements of  this  section  shall  not
      apply  to:  (i)  any  transaction  in which a person acquires a firearm,
      rifle or shotgun by operation of law, or because of the death of another

        (v) the sale of a firearm by a dealer in firearms to  a  person  whose

Section 10-303 ::    
        
     
        ยง  10-303  Permits for possession and purchase of rifles and shotguns.
      It shall be unlawful to dispose of any rifle or shotgun  to  any  person
      unless said person is the holder of a permit for possession and purchase
      of  rifles  and shotguns; it shall be unlawful for any person to have in
      his or her possession any rifle or shotgun unless  said  person  is  the
      holder  of  a  permit  for  the  possession  and  purchase of rifles and
      shotguns.
        The disposition of a rifle or  shotgun,  by  any  licensed  dealer  in
      rifles  and shotguns, to any person presenting a valid rifle and shotgun
      permit issued to such person, shall be conclusive proof of the  legality
      of such disposition by the dealer.
        a.  Requirements.  No  person shall be denied a permit to purchase and
      possess a rifle or shotgun unless the applicant:
        (1) is under the age of twenty-one; or
        (2) is not of good moral character; or
        (3) has been convicted anywhere of a felony; of a serious  offense  as

      the  ten  years  preceding  the submission of the application; or of any
      three misdemeanors as defined in local, state or  federal  law,  however
      nothing  in  this  paragraph shall preclude the denial of a permit to an
      applicant with fewer than three misdemeanor convictions; or
        (4) has not stated whether he or she  has  ever  suffered  any  mental
      illness  or  been  confined  to  any  hospital or institution, public or
      private, for mental illness; or
        (5) is not now free from any mental  disorders,  defects  or  diseases
      that  would  impair  the  ability  safely  to  possess or use a rifle or
      shotgun; or
        (6) has been the subject of a suspension or ineligibility order issued
      pursuant to ยง 530.14 of the New York State Criminal Procedure Law  or  ยง
      842-a of the New York State Family Court Act; or
        (7) who is subject to a court order that
        (a)  was  issued  after a hearing of which such person received actual
      notice, and at which such person had the opportunity to participate;
        (b) restrains such person from harassing, stalking, or threatening  an
      intimate  partner  of  such  person or child of such intimate partner or
      person, or engaging in  other  conduct  that  would  place  an  intimate
      partner in reasonable fear of bodily injury to the partner or child; and
        (c)(i)  includes  a  finding  that  such  person represents a credible
      threat to the physical safety of such intimate partner or child; or
        (ii) by its terms explicitly prohibits  the  use,  attempted  use,  or
      threatened  use of physical force against such intimate partner or child
      that would reasonably be expected to cause bodily injury;
        (d) For purposes of this section only, "intimate partner" means,  with
      respect  to  a  person, the spouse of the person, a former spouse of the
      person, an individual who is a parent of a child of the person,  and  an
      individual who cohabitates or has cohabitated with the person; or
        (8)  has been convicted of violating section 10-303.1 of this chapter;
      or
        (9) unless good cause exists for the denial of the permit.
        b. Application. Application for a rifle and shotgun  permit  shall  be
      made  to  the  police  commissioner, shall be signed and affirmed by the
      applicant and  shall  state  his  or  her  full  name,  date  of  birth,
      residence, physical condition, occupation and whether he or she complies
      with  each  requirement  specified in subdivision a of this section, and
      any other information required by the police commissioner to process the
    
      application. Each applicant shall submit with his or her  application  a
      photograph  of  himself  or  herself in duplicate, which shall have been
      taken within thirty days prior to the filing  of  the  application.  Any
      willful  or material omission or false statement shall be a violation of
      this section and grounds for denial of the application.
        c. Before a permit is issued or renewed, the police  department  shall
      investigate  all  statements  required  in  the  application.  For  that
      purpose, the records of the  department  of  mental  hygiene  concerning
      previous  or  present mental illness of the applicant shall be available
      for inspection by the investigating officer of the police department. In
      order to ascertain  any  previous  criminal  record,  the  investigating
      officer  shall  take  the  fingerprints and physical descriptive data in
      quadruplicate of each individual by whom the application is signed.  Two
      copies of such fingerprints shall be taken on standard fingerprint cards
      eight  inches  square,  and one copy may be taken on a card supplied for
      that purpose by the federal bureau of investigation. When completed, one
      standard card shall be promptly submitted to the  division  of  criminal
      justice  services  where  it  shall be appropriately processed. A second
      standard  card,  or  the  one  supplied  by  the   federal   bureau   of
      investigation,  as the case may be, shall be forwarded to that bureau at
      Washington with a request that the files of the bureau be  searched  and
      notification  of  the  results  of  the  search  be  made  to the police
      department.  The  failure  or  refusal  of   the   federal   bureau   of
      investigation to make the fingerprint check provided for in this section
      shall  not  constitute  the  sole  basis  for  refusal to issue a permit
      pursuant to the  provisions  of  this  section.  Of  the  remaining  two
      fingerprint  cards,  one  shall  be filed with the executive department,
      division of state police, Albany, within ten days after issuance of  the
      permit, and the other remain on file with the police department. No such
      fingerprints  may be inspected by any person other than a peace officer,
      when acting pursuant to his or her special duties, or a police  officer,
      except  on order of a justice of a court of record either upon notice to
      the permittee or without notice,  as  the  judge  or  justice  may  deem
      appropriate. Upon completion of the investigation, the police department
      shall  report the results to the police commissioner without unnecessary
      delay.
        d. Fees. The fee for an application for a rifle and shotgun permit  or
      renewal thereof shall be one hundred forty dollars.
        e. Issuance. (1) Upon completion of the investigation, and in no event
      later  than  thirty  days from the submission of the application, unless
      the  police  commissioner  determines  more  time  is  needed   for   an
      investigation  and then it shall not exceed sixty days, the commissioner
      shall issue the permit or shall notify the applicant of  the  denial  of
      the  application and the reason or reasons therefor. The applicant shall
      have the right to appeal said denial pursuant to procedures  established
      by the police commissioner for administrative review.
        (2)  Any person holding a valid license to carry a concealed weapon in
      accordance with the provisions of the penal law, shall  be  issued  such
      permit  upon  filing  an application and upon paying the established fee
      therefor, without the necessity of any further investigation, affidavits
      or fingerprinting, unless the police commissioner has reason to  believe
      that  the  status of the applicant has changed since the issuance of the
      prior license.
        f. Validity. Any person to whom a rifle and shotgun  permit  has  been
      validly  issued pursuant to this chapter may possess a rifle or shotgun.
      No permit shall  be  transferred  to  any  other  person.  Every  person
      carrying  a  rifle  or  shotgun shall have on his or her person a permit
      which shall be exhibited for inspection to any peace officer  or  police
    
      officer upon demand. Failure of any such person to so exhibit his or her
      permit  shall  be  presumptive  evidence  that  he  or  she  is not duly
      authorized to possess a rifle or shotgun and the same may be  considered
      by the police commissioner as cause for revocation or suspension of such
      permit. A permit shall be valid for three (3) years and shall be subject
      to automatic renewal, upon sworn application, and without investigation,
      unless  the police commissioner has reason to believe that the status of
      the applicant has changed since the previous application.
        g. Revocation or suspension.  A  permit  shall  be  revoked  upon  the
      conviction  in  this state, or elsewhere, of a person holding a rifle or
      shotgun permit, of a felony or  a  serious  offense.  A  permit  may  be
      revoked   or   suspended   at  any  time  upon  evidence  of  any  other
      disqualification set forth  in  subdivision  a  of  this  section.  Upon
      revocation  or  suspension  of  a  permit  for  any  reason,  the police
      commissioner shall immediately notify the New  York  state  division  of
      criminal  justice  services.  The police commissioner shall from time to
      time send a notice and supplemental report hereof, containing the names,
      addresses and permit numbers of each  person  whose  rifle  and  shotgun
      permit  has  been revoked or suspended to all licensed dealers in rifles
      and shotguns throughout the city  for  the  purpose  of  notifying  such
      dealers  that  no rifles or shotguns may be issued or sold or in any way
      disposed of to any such persons. The police commissioner or  any  police
      officer  acting  at  the police commissioner's direction shall forthwith
      seize any rifle and shotgun permit which has been revoked  or  suspended
      hereunder and shall seize any rifle or shotgun possessed by such person,
      provided  that the person whose rifle or shotgun permit has been revoked
      or suspended, or such person's appointee or legal representative,  shall
      have  the right at any time up to one year after such seizure to dispose
      of such rifle or shotgun to any licensed  dealer  or  any  other  person
      legally  permitted  to  purchase  or  take  possession  of such rifle or
      shotgun. The permittee shall have the right to appeal any suspension  or
      revocation  pursuant  to  procedures established by the commissioner for
      administrative review.
        h. Non-residents. Non-residents of the city of New York may apply  for
      a  rifle  or  shotgun permit subject to the same conditions, regulations
      and requirements as residents of the city of New York.

        e.  Disposition  of assault weapons by non-permittees. Any person who,
      on or after the effective date of  this  local  law,  shall  possess  an
      assault  weapon  and  who  is  not  the  holder  of  a  valid permit for

      registration  for  such assault weapon, shall peaceably surrender his or
      her assault weapon pursuant to subdivision f of section 10-305  for  the
      purpose of destruction of such weapon by the commissioner, provided that
      the commissioner may authorize the use of such weapon by the department,
      and  provided  further  that  heirs  and legatees may dispose of assault
      weapons pursuant to subdivision f of this section.
        f. Disposition of assault weapons by heirs and  legatees.  Any  person
      who  acquires  an  assault weapon on or after the effective date of this

      permittee for  unlawful  possession  or  disposition  of  such  weapons.
      Failure  by  the commissioner to send, or the permittee to receive, such
      notice, shall not excuse  such  permittee  for  unlawful  possession  or
      disposition of such weapons.
        h.   Surrender   of   firearms.   At  the  discretion  of  the  police
      commissioner, any person convicted of  violating  this  section  may  be

      such statute, law or regulation to be obtained from purchasers;
        (3) The manufacturer or dealer provides access to  the  aforementioned

      statutes, laws and regulations governing the transfer of firearms; and
        (6) The manufacturer or dealer has not transferred a  firearm  to  any
      other  manufacturer or dealer in circumstances in which the manufacturer
      or dealer transferring such firearm knew or should have known that  such
    
      manufacturer  or dealer had not complied with the standards set forth in
      this subdivision.
        c. Exceptions. (1) No action may be commenced pursuant to this section
      by  any  person  injured or killed by the discharge of a firearm that is

      or killed by the discharge of a firearm was committing or attempting  to
      commit a crime (whether or not such crime is actually charged); (ii) the
      unlawful transfer or possession of the firearm is solely a result of the

      (iii)  prior  to  the  injury  or  death caused by the firearm, a lawful

      dealer lawfully transferred the firearm  to:  (i)  a  public  agency  in
      furtherance  of  official  business;  (ii)  a  law  enforcement  officer
      employed by a public agency; (iii) a private security firm, holding  any

      proves  by  a  preponderance of the evidence that the injury or death is
      not directly or indirectly related  to  any  act  or  omission  by  such
      manufacturer  or dealer, including but not limited to any failure by the
      manufacturer or dealer  to  comply  with  the  standards  set  forth  in

Section 10-304 ::    
        
     
        ยง 10-304 Certificates of registration. a. It shall be unlawful for any
      person to have in his or her possession any rifle or shotgun unless said
      person  is the holder of a certificate of registration for such rifle or
      shotgun.
        b. It shall be unlawful for any person who is not a licensed dealer to
      dispose of any rifle or shotgun for which such person does  not  have  a
      certificate  of  registration  unless  such person files with the police
      commissioner a declaration in duplicate,  signed  and  affirmed  by  the
      declarant  which shall list by caliber, make, model, manufacturer's name
      and serial number, or  if  none,  any  other  distinguishing  number  or
      identification  mark,  of  each  rifle  and  shotgun  possessed  by  the
      declarant. Upon receipt of acknowledgement of said  declaration  by  the
      police  commissioner,  the  declarant  may  lawfully  sell, transfer, or
      otherwise dispose of such rifles or shotguns to a licensed dealer or any
      other person legally permitted to purchase or take  possession  of  such
      rifles or shotguns.
        Any  willful  or  material  omission  or  false  statement  shall be a
      violation of this section.
        c. Exhibition of certificate. Every person carrying a rifle or shotgun
      shall have on his or her person a certificate of registration valid  for
      such weapon. Upon demand, the appropriate certificate shall be exhibited
      for  inspection  to  any peace officer or police officer. Failure of any
      person to so  exhibit  his  or  her  certificate  shall  be  presumptive
      evidence  that he or she is not duly authorized to possess such rifle or
      shotgun and may be considered by the police commissioner  as  cause  for
      revocation or suspension or such person's permit.
        d.  Revocation.  The  revocation  of  a  rifle or shotgun permit shall
      automatically be deemed to  be  a  revocation  of  all  certificates  of
      registration for rifles and shotguns held by the person whose permit has
      been revoked.
        e.   Disposition  of  rifles  and  shotguns.  No  person  lawfully  in
      possession of a rifle or shotgun shall  dispose  of  same  except  to  a
      licensed dealer in firearms, licensed dealer in rifles and shotguns, the
      holder  of  a  valid  rifle  and  shotgun  permit,  an  exempt person as
      enumerated in this chapter, or a non-resident of the city  of  New  York
      not subject to the permit requirements of this chapter.
        Any  person  so  disposing  of  a  rifle  or  shotgun shall report the
      disposition on forms provided by  the  commissioner  setting  forth  the
      rifle  and shotgun permit number of both seller and purchaser, the make,
      caliber, type, model and serial number, if any, and if the seller  is  a
      licensed  dealer  the  certificate  of  registration number, of all such
      rifles and shotguns. Such form  shall  be  signed  by  both  seller  and
      purchaser and the original shall be forwarded to the police commissioner
      within  seventy-two hours of the disposition, one copy shall be retained
      by the seller, another by the purchaser.
        1. If the seller is a licensed dealer, he or she shall at the time  of
      the  sale  issue a certificate of registration to the purchaser provided
      to the dealer for that purpose by  the  police  commissioner  and  shall
      forward  to the police commissioner the duplicate thereof, together with
      the report of disposition.
        2. If the seller is not a licensed  dealer,  the  police  commissioner
      shall,  if  the purchaser's rifle permit is valid, issue the certificate
      of  registration  within  ten  days  of  the  receipt  by   the   police
      commissioner  of  the  report  of  disposition.  Pending  receipt of the
      certificate, but in no event for any longer than fourteen days from  the
      date  of  purchase, the copy of the report of disposition shall serve in
      lieu of the purchaser's certificate of registration.
        f. No fee shall be charged for a certificate of registration.
    
        g. Notwithstanding any other provision of this section concerning  the
      transfer,  receipt,  acquisition, or any other disposition of a rifle or
      shotgun, a rifle and shotgun  permit  shall  not  be  required  for  the
      passing  of a rifle or shotgun upon the death of an owner, to his or her
      heir  or  legatee, whether the same be by testamentary bequest or by the
      laws of intestacy, except that  the  person  who  shall  so  receive  or
      acquire  said  rifle or shotgun shall be subject to all other provisions
      of this chapter, provided further that if the heir  or  legatee  of  the
      owner  of  such  rifle or shotgun does not qualify to possess same under
      this chapter, the rifle or shotgun may  be  possessed  by  the  heir  or
      legatee  for  the  purpose  of  sale  as otherwise provided herein for a
      period not exceeding one hundred eighty days or for such further limited
      period beyond the one hundred eighty days as  may  be  approved  by  the
      commissioner,  said  extensions  in no event to exceed a total of ninety
      days.

      organization; nor shall that member  be  exempt  from  registering  such
