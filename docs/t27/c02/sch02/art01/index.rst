      in good repair,  and  shall  be  responsible  for  compliance  with  the
      provisions  of  this code, except to the extent otherwise agreed between

Section 27-2006 ::    
        
     
        §  27-2006  Duties  of  tenant.  a.  A  tenant  shall,  in addition to
      complying with all provisions of this code and the multiple dwelling law
      applicable to him or her, be responsible for violations of this code  to
      the  extent  that he or she has the power to prevent the occurrence of a
      violation. A tenant has  the  power  to  prevent  the  occurrence  of  a
      violation if:
        (1)  It  is caused by his or her own wilful act or that of a member of
      his or her family or household, or a guest; or
        (2) It is the result of such tenant's  gross  negligence,  neglect  or
      abuse,  or  the gross negligence, neglect or abuse of a member of his or
      her family, or household or a guest.
        b. The tenant, any member of his or her family or household, or his or
      her guest shall, with respect to the public parts of  the  premises,  be
      liable  if  a violation is caused by such tenant's own wilful act, gross
      negligence, neglect or abuse.
        c. The fact that a tenant is or may be liable for a violation of  this
      code or any other law or is found liable for civil or criminal penalties
      does  not  relieve  the  owner  of  his  or  her  obligation to keep the
      premises, and every part thereof, in good repair.

        §  27-2008  Owner's  right of access. No tenant shall refuse to permit
      the owner, or his or her agent  or  employee,  to  enter  such  tenant's
      dwelling unit or other space under his or her control to make repairs or
      improvements  required  by  this  code  or  other law or to inspect such
      apartment or other space to determine compliance with this code  or  any

      a tenant for violation of this code which:
        (1)  Results  from  wilful  or  grossly  negligent  conduct and causes
      substantial damage to the dwelling units; or

      dwelling unit to the owner or his or  her  agent  or  employee  for  the
      purpose  of  making repairs or improvements required by this code, shall
      constitute grounds for summary  proceedings  by  the  owner  to  recover
      possession of such dwelling unit from the tenant.
    
    
    
    
    
    
    

Section 27-2009.1
-----------------

Section 27-2009.1 ::    
        
     
        §  27-2009.1  Rights  and  responsibilities  of  owners and tenants in
      relation to pets. a. Legislative declaration. The council  hereby  finds
      that  the enforcement of covenants contained in multiple dwelling leases
      which prohibit the harboring of household pets  has  led  to  widespread
      abuses by building owners or their agents, who knowing that a tenant has
      a  pet  for  an extended period of time, seek to evict the tenant and/or
      his or her pet  often  for  reasons  unrelated  to  the  creation  of  a
      nuisance.  Because  household  pets  are  kept for reasons of safety and
      companionship and under the existence of a continuing housing  emergency
      it  is  necessary to protect pet owners from retaliatory eviction and to
      safeguard the health, safety and welfare  of  tenants  who  harbor  pets
      under  the  circumstances  provided  herein, it is hereby found that the
      enactment of the provisions of this  section  is  necessary  to  prevent
      potential hardship and dislocation of tenants within this city.
        b.  Where a tenant in a multiple dwelling openly and notoriously for a
      period of three months or more following taking possession  of  a  unit,
      harbors  or has harbored a household pet or pets, the harboring of which
      is not prohibited by the multiple dwelling law, the housing  maintenance
      or the health codes of the city of New York or any other applicable law,
      and  the  owner or his or her agent has knowledge of this fact, and such
      owner fails within  this  three  month  period  to  commence  a  summary
      proceeding  or  action  to  enforce  a  lease  provision prohibiting the
      keeping of such household pets, such lease  provision  shall  be  deemed
      waived.
        c.  It  shall be unlawful for an owner or his or her agent, by express
      terms or otherwise, to restrict a tenant's rights as  provided  in  this
      section.  Any such restriction shall be unenforceable and deemed void as
      against public policy.
        d. The waiver provision of this section  shall  not  apply  where  the
      harboring  of  a  household  pet  causes  damage to the subject premise,
      creates a nuisance or interferes substantially with the  health,  safety
      or  welfare  of  other  tenants  or  occupants  of  the same or adjacent
      building or structure.
        e. The New York city  housing  authority  shall  be  exempt  from  the
      provisions of this section.
