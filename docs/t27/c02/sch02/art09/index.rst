        b.  No  person  shall  install  or maintain in any dwelling unit a gas
      fuel-fired space or water heater unless the  heater  obtains  combustion
      air directly from the outside of the building. In the alternative, a gas
      fuel-fired water heater that does not obtain its combustion air directly
      from  the  outside  of the building may be installed, provided that such
      installation is in compliance with the conditions of  subdivision  i  of

      installed.
        d. No person  shall  install  or  maintain  in  any  dwelling  unit  a
      gas-fueled  water heater so designed and arranged that it heats water in
      pipe coils placed at a distance from the hot water storage tank.
        e. Every gas fuel-fired space or water heater shall be  (i)  currently
      listed  by  an  independent laboratory acceptable to the commissioner of
      buildings, (ii) approved  by  the  department  of  buildings  and  (iii)
      approved   by  the  department  of  health  and  mental  hygiene.    All
      accessories or control devices for use  with  such  heaters  shall  have
      proof of such listing.
        f.  Each  heater shall be equipped with an effective device which will
      automatically shut off the gas supply to the heater if its  pilot  light
      or other constantly burning flame is extinguished, or in the event of an
      interruption  of  the  gas supply to the heater, and will not permit the
      heater to be relighted  unless  such  shut-off  device  is  first  reset
      manually.
        g.  Each heater shall be rigidly connected to the gas piping supplying
      gas in the premises.
        h. Each heater shall be connected to a flue or outlet pipe  conforming
      to  the provisions of the building code. No heater shall be vented to an
      inner court. A flue or outlet pipe may be extended to an inner court  if
      the  flue  or  pipe  is connected with an outside chimney which conforms
      with the provisions of the building code.
