      alternative  to a central supply of heat or hot water, shall be governed
      by the provisions of this section.

      and the multiple dwelling law.
        d.   Gas-fueled  heaters  shall  comply  with  article  nine  of  this
      subchapter and with applicable provisions of the building code  and  the
      multiple dwelling law, but any such heater lawfully in existence on July

      subdivision b of section 27-2034 of  article  nine  of  this  subchapter
      shall  comply  with  such  section  by July fourteenth, nineteen hundred

        f. Notwithstanding any provision of prior law, it shall be the duty of
      the  owner  to  keep  each such heater in good repair and good operating
      condition, regardless of the identity of the person originally owning or
      installing the heater.
        g. The owner shall instruct each successive tenant of an apartment  in
      which  such  heaters are installed as to safe and proper method of using
      and operating such heaters.
        h. The department may make and enforce  regulations  supplementary  to
      the  provisions  of  this section and article nine of this subchapter to
      secure an adequate supply of heat and  hot  water  and  to  protect  the
