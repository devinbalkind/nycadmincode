      control of a dwelling shall provide and maintain metal  cans,  or  other
      receptacles jointly approved as to specifications by the department, the
      department  of  sanitation  and  the  department  of  health  and mental
      hygiene, for the exclusive use of  each  building,  which  shall  be  of
      sufficient  size  and  number  to contain the wastes accumulated in such
      building during a period of seventy-two hours. No  receptacle  shall  be
      filled to a height so as to prevent the effective closure thereof and no
      receptacle  shall  weigh  more  than one hundred pounds when filled. The
      receptacles shall be so constructed as to hold  their  contents  without
      leakage.  Metal  cans  shall  be  provided with tight-fitting covers and
      other receptacles shall be effectively closed.  When  requested  by  the
      department  of  sanitation,  the  owner  or  occupant  in  control shall
      separate and place in separate receptacles, ashes, organic and inorganic
      wastes.  Nothing  contained  in  this  subdivision  shall  prevent   the
      department,  the  department  of sanitation and the department of health
      and mental hygiene from jointly approving  as  to  specifications  other
      systems  for  the  disposal of waste utilizing containers of larger size
      and different construction as may be appropriate for such systems.
        b. Metal cans shall be kept within the dwelling or as required by  the
      department  until the time for removal of their contents when they shall
      be placed in front of the dwelling. When  inside  storage  is  required,
      receptacles  of  other  materials  shall  be  kept  in  a metal can or a
      rat-proof and fireproof room until the time of their removal  when  they
      shall  be  removed  from the metal can and be neatly stacked in front of
      the dwelling. After the contents have been removed by the department  of
      sanitation,  any  receptacles  remaining  shall  be returned promptly to
      their place of storage. Metal cans shall be kept covered  at  all  times
      and  shall  be  disinfected  regularly  and  maintained  in  a  sanitary
      condition. Yard sweepings, hedge cuttings, grass, leaves, earth,  stone,
      or bricks shall not be mixed with household wastes.
        c.  Newspapers,  wrapping  paper,  or other inorganic wastes which are
      likely to be blown or scattered about  the  streets  shall  be  securely
      bundled,  tied  or  packed  before  being  placed  for  collection. Such
      material shall be kept and placed for collection in the same  manner  as
      the receptacles.
