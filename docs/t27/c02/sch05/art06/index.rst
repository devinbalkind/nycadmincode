      applicable law in any multiple dwelling or  any  part  of  its  premises
      constitutes a serious fire hazard or is a serious threat to life, health
      or  safety, it may, upon failure of the owner to comply with an order to
      correct such conditions issued pursuant to section  27-2125  of  article

        §  27-2131  Notice  to  owner,  mortgagees  and  lienors.  a.  If  the
      department intends to seek the appointment of a receiver  to  remove  or

      upon the owner, along with the order  pursuant  to  section  27-2125  of
      article  five of this subchapter, a notice stating that in the event the

      for the appointment of a receiver of the rents, issues  and  profits  of
      the  property  with  rights  superior  to  those  of  the  owner and any
      mortgagee or lienor.
        b. Within five days after service of the order  and  notice  upon  the
      owner,  the  department  shall serve a copy of the order and notice upon
      every mortgagee and lienor of record, personally  or  by  registered  or
      certified  mail,  at  the  address set forth in the recorded mortgage or
      lien. If no address appears therein, a copy shall be sent by  registered
      mail to the person at whose request the instrument was recorded.
        c.  The  department  shall  file a copy of the notice and order in the
      office of the county  clerk  in  which  mechanics  liens  affecting  the

---------------

Section 27-2132 ::    
        
     
        §  27-2132 Order to show cause. a. The department, upon failure of the
      owner to comply with an order 27-2131 of this article  within  the  time
      provided   therein,  may  thereafter  apply  to  a  court  of  competent
      jurisdiction in the county where the property is situated for  an  order
      directing  the  owner  and  any  mortgagees or lienors of record to show
      cause why the  commissioner  of  housing  preservation  and  development
      should not be appointed receiver of the rents, issues and profits of the
      property and why the receiver should not remove or remedy such condition
      and obtain a lien in favor of the department of housing preservation and
      development against the property having the priority provided in article
      eight  of  this  subchapter to secure repayment of the costs incurred by
      the receiver in removing such conditions. Such application shall contain
      (a) proof by affidavit that an order of the department has been  issued,
      served  on  the  owner, mortgagees and lienors, and filed, in accordance
      with section 27-2131 of this article; (b) a  statement  that  a  serious
      fire  hazard or a serious threat to life, health, or safety continued to
      exist in said dwelling after the time fixed in the department order  for
      correction  of  the  condition,  and  a  description of the dwelling and
      conditions involved; (c) a brief description of the nature of  the  work
      required  to  remove  or  remedy the condition and an estimate as to the
      cost thereof.
        b. The order to show cause shall be returnable not less than five days
      after service is completed.
        c. A copy of the order to show cause, and the papers on  which  it  is
      based,  shall be served on the owner, mortgagees of record, and lienors.
      If any such persons cannot  with  due  diligence  be  served  personally
      within  the city within the time fixed in the order, then service may be
      made by posting a copy of the  order  in  a  conspicuous  place  on  the
      premises,  and by sending a copy thereof by registered mail to the owner
      at the  last  address,  if  any,  registered  by  such  owner  with  the
      department,  or  to  his  or  her  last  address,  if  any, known to the
      department, or, in the case of a mortgagee or lienor, to the address set
      forth in the  recorded  mortgage  or  lien,  and  by  publication  in  a
      newspaper  of  general circulation in the county where such premises are
      located. Service shall be deemed complete on filing proof thereof in the
      office of the clerk of the court in which application for such order  is
      made.
    
    
    
    
    
    
    

Section 27-2133
---------------

Section 27-2133 ::    
        
     
        §  27-2133  Temporary  appointment of receiver. a. If the condition of
      the premises is such that unless immediately  cured  irreparable  damage
      may  be  caused  to the building or it constitutes an imminent danger to
      its occupants or the occupants of adjoining properties, then  the  order
      to  show  cause may be returnable in the discretion of the court in less
      than five days, and in such case, service may be made by posting a  copy
      of  the  order  in  a conspicuous place on the premises and by mailing a
      copy to the owner at the address registered with the department  and  to
      the  mortgagees  and  lienors  at  their  respective  addresses. But any
      appointment of a receiver without service pursuant to subdivision  c  of
      section  27-2132  of this article shall be temporary only and expire not
      more than thirty days thereafter unless, prior to the expiration of  the
      thirty  days,  the department shall serve notice on the owner, mortgagee
      and lienors in the manner provided  for  in  subdivision  c  of  section
      27-2132  of  this  article  of intention to apply to the court at a date
      fixed in such notice and not less than five days after  the  service  of
      such notice, for an extension of the receivership. Upon such service the
      period   of   the   appointment  of  the  temporary  receiver  shall  be
      automatically extended for a further period of fifteen days. The  notice
      shall  also  contain,  in  addition  to  the order to show cause and the
      papers on which it is based, a statement of  any  expenditures  made  or
      obligations  incurred  by  the  receiver during the period of his or her
      temporary appointment. On the date fixed in the notice, the court  shall
      determine  whether  or  not  to  extend the period of receivership. Such
      determination shall be made as if the application were an  original  one
      for the appointment of a receiver.
        b.  A  temporary receiver shall have the powers and duties provided in
      section 27-2135 of this article,  except  that  he  or  she  shall  not,
      without  express order of the court, make any repairs or improvements to
      the property or incur any expenses in the operation thereof  during  the
      period  of  his  or  her  temporary  appointment  except  such as may be
      necessary (1) to remedy or remove the immediate condition or  conditions
      which  called  for  his  or  her  appointment,  and  (2) to the ordinary
      operation and maintenance of the property. For such specific purpose the
      receiver shall be entitled to let  such  contracts  and  undertake  such
      expenses as may be necesssary to accomplish the specific results without
      advertisements and without procuring competitive bids.
    
    
    
    
    
    
    

Section 27-2134
---------------

Section 27-2134 ::    
        
     
        §  27-2134  Proceedings  on  return  of order to show cause. a. On the
      return of the order to show  cause,  determination  thereof  shall  have
      precedence over every other business of the court unless the court shall
      find  that  some  other  pending  proceeding, having a similar statutory
      preference, has priority.
        b. If the court finds that the facts stated in the application warrant
      the granting thereof, then it shall appoint the commissioner of  housing
      preservation  and  development receiver of the rents, issues and profits
      of the property.
        c.  Notwithstanding  subdivision  b  of  this   section,   if,   after
      determination  of  the  issue,  the owner, or any mortgagee or lienor or
      other person having an interest in the  property,  shall  apply  to  the
      court  to  be  permitted to remove or remedy the conditions set forth in
      the department's application  and  shall  (1)  demonstrate  the  ability
      promptly  to  undertake the work required; and (2) post security for the
      performance thereof within the time,  and  in  the  amount  and  manner,
      deemed  necessary by the court, then the court may in lieu of appointing
      a receiver issue an order permitting such person  to  perform  the  work
      within  a time fixed by the court. If at the time fixed in the order the
      work has not been satisfactorily done,  the  court  shall  appoint  such
      receiver.  If  after  the  granting  of  an order permitting a person to
      perform the work but  before  the  time  fixed  by  the  court  for  the
      completion  thereof  it  shall  appear to the department that the person
      permitted to do the same is not proceeding with due diligence, then  the
      department  may  apply to the court, on notice to those persons who have
      appeared in the  proceeding,  for  a  hearing  to  determine  whether  a
      receiver shall be appointed immediately. On the failure of any person to
      complete  the  work  in accordance with the provisions of an order under
      this subdivision, the department, or any receiver  thereafter  appointed
      shall  be  reimbursed  for  costs  incurred by him or her in removing or
      remedying the condition and other charges herein provided for out of the
      security posted by such person.
    
    
    
    
    
    
    

Section 27-2135
---------------

Section 27-2135 ::    
        
     
        §  27-2135  Powers  and  duties  of  receiver. a. A receiver appointed
      pursuant to this article shall have all of the powers and  duties  of  a
      receiver  appointed  in  an  action  to  foreclose  a  mortgage  on real
      property, together with such additional  powers  and  duties  as  herein
      granted  and  imposed.  Such  receiver shall not be required to file any
      bond.
        b. The receiver shall with all reasonable speed remove  violations  in
      the  dwelling  and  its  premises,  including  those constituting a fire
      hazard or a threat to life, health or safety. He or  she  may  also,  in
      addition  to  ordinary  repairs, maintenance and replacement, make other
      improvements to effect a rehabilitation of the property, in such fashion
      as is consistent with maintaining safe and habitable conditions over the
      remaining useful life of the dwelling. He or she shall have the power to
      let  contracts  or  incur  expenses  therefor  in  accordance  with  the
      provisions  of  law applicable to contracts for public works except that
      advertisement  shall  not  be   required   for   each   such   contract.
      Notwithstanding  any provision of law, the receiver may let contracts or
      incur expenses for individual items of repairs, improvements or supplies
      without the procurement of competitive bids where the  total  amount  of
      any such individual item does not exceed twenty-five hundred dollars.
        c.  The  receiver shall collect the accrued and accruing rents, issues
      and profits of the dwelling and apply  the  same  to  the  cost  of  the
      repairs  and improvements authorized in subdivision (b) of this section,
      to the payment of expenses reasonably necessary to the proper  operation
      and  management of the property, including insurance and the fees of the
      managing agent, and the necessary expenses  of  his  or  her  office  as
      receiver,  the  repayment  of all moneys advanced to the receiver by the
      department of housing preservation and development to  cover  the  costs
      incurred  by  the receiver and interest thereon; and then, if there be a
      surplus, to unpaid taxes, assessments,  water  rents,  sewer  rents  and
      penalties  and  interest  thereon, and then to sums due to mortgagees or
      lienors. If the income of the property shall be  insufficient  to  cover
      the  cost  of  the  repairs  and improvements or the expenses reasonably
      necessary to the proper operation and management  of  the  property  and
      other  necessary  expenses  of  the  receiver, the department of housing
      preservation and development shall advance  to  the  receiver  any  sums
      required  to cover such cost and expense and thereupon shall have a lien
      against the property having the priority provided in  article  eight  of
      this subchapter for any such sums so advanced with interest thereon.
        d.  The  receiver  shall be entitled to the same fees, commissions and
      necessary expenses as receivers in actions to foreclose mortgages.  Such
      fees  and  commissions  shall  be paid into the fund created pursuant to
      section 27-2111 of article one of this subchapter. The receiver shall be
      liable only in his or her official capacity for  injury  to  person  and
      property  by  reason  of  conditions  of the premises in a case where an
      owner would have been liable; such receiver shall not have any liability
      in his or her personal capacity. The personnel  and  facilities  of  the
      department  of  housing preservation and development and the corporation
      counsel shall be availed of by the receiver for the purpose of  carrying
      out  his or her duties as receiver, and the costs of such services shall
      be deemed a necessary expense of the receiver.
    
    
    
    
    
    
    

Section 27-2136
---------------

Section 27-2136 ::    
        
     
        § 27-2136 Discharge of receiver. The receiver shall be discharged upon
      rendering  a  full and complete accounting to the court when the repairs
      and improvements herein authorized are completed and  the  cost  thereof
      and  all other costs authorized herein have been paid or reimbursed from
      the rents and income of the dwelling and the surplus money, if any,  has
      been  paid over to the owner or the mortgagee or lienor as the court may
      direct. However, at any time, the receiver may be discharged upon filing
      his or her account as  receiver  without  affecting  the  right  of  the
      department of housing preservation and development to its lien. Upon the
      completion  of the repairs and improvements, the owner, the mortgagee or
      any lienor may apply for the discharge of the receiver upon  payment  to
      the receiver of all moneys expended by him or her therefor and all other
      costs  authorized by section 27-2135 of this article which have not been
      paid or reimbursed from the rents and income of the dwelling.
    
    
    
    
    
    
    

Section 27-2137
---------------

Section 27-2137 ::    
        
     
        §  27-2137  Recovery of expenses of receivership; lien of receiver. a.
      The expenditures made by the receiver pursuant  to  section  27-2135  of
      this  article  shall, to the extent that they are not recovered from the
      rents and income of the property collected by the receiver, constitute a
      debt of the owner and a lien upon the building and  lot,  and  upon  the
      rents  and income thereof. Except as otherwise provided in this section,
      the provisions of article eight of  this  subchapter  shall  govern  the
      effect  and enforcement of such debt and lien; references therein to the
      department shall, for purposes of this article be deemed to refer to the
      receiver and, after such receiver's discharge, the department of housing
      preservation and development.
        b. Failure to serve a copy of the order and  notice  required  in  the
      manner specified by section 27-2131 of this article, or failure to serve
      any  mortgagee  or  lienor  with  a  copy  of the order to show cause as
      required by subdivision c of section 27-2132 of this article, shall  not
      affect  the validity of the proceeding or the appointment of a receiver,
      but the rights of the department of housing preservation and development
      or of the receiver shall not in such event be superior to the rights  of
      any mortgagee or lienor who has not been served as provided therein.
        c.  Any  mortgagee  or  lienor  who  at his or her expense remedies or
      removes the conditions to the satisfaction of the court pursuant to  the
      provisions  of  subdivision  c  of section 27-2134 of this article shall
      have and be entitled to enforce a lien equivalent to the lien granted to
      the receiver in favor of the  department  of  housing  preservation  and
      development  hereunder.  Any  mortgagee  or  lienor  who,  following the
      appointment of a receiver by the court, shall reimburse the receiver and
      the department of housing preservation and development for all costs and
      charges as hereinabove provided shall be entitled to  an  assignment  of
      the  lien  granted to the receiver in favor of the department of housing
      preservation and development.
    
    
    
    
    
    
    

Section 27-2138
---------------

Section 27-2138 ::    
        
     
        §  27-2138 Obligations of owner not affected. Nothing herein contained
      shall be deemed to relieve the owner of any civil or criminal  liability
      incurred  or  any  duty imposed by law by reason of acts or omissions of
      the owner prior to the appointment of a  receiver,  nor  shall  anything
      contained  herein  be  construed  to suspend during the receivership any
      obligation of the owner for the payment of taxes or other operating  and
      maintenance  expenses  of  the  dwelling  nor  of the owner or any other
      person for the payment of mortgages or liens.
