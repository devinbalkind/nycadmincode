Section 27-2123 ::    
        
     
        § 27-2123 Court order of access to inspect premises. a. A judge of any
      civil  court of competent jurisdiction may, upon appropriate application
      by the department supported by an affidavit  or  affirmation,  issue  an
      order  directing  that  access be provided to an officer or inspector of
      the department to any premises or part thereof, whenever  an  inspection
      of  any  premises or part thereof is required or authorized by any state
      or local law or regulation or  entry  to  such  area  is  necessary  for
      correction of a condition violating such law or regulation.
        b.  If  the  application  is found appropriate, the court may issue an
      order to show cause why the order of access should not be issued. If the
      respondent cannot with due diligence be  served  personally  within  the
      time  fixed in such order, service may be made on such person by posting
      a copy thereof in a conspicuous place in the premises to which access is
      sought and by sending a copy thereof by certified mail,  return  receipt
      requested, to such person at his or her last known address.
        c. The court shall set in the order of access specific dates and times
      for access.
        d.  The  person,  officer  or  inspector  gaining access shall, before
      entry, give notice of his or her authority and purpose to  any  occupant
      of  the premises and show such occupant the order or a copy thereof upon
      request.
        e. Notwithstanding any other provision contained in section 27-2118 of
      article three of this subchapter,  a  person  who  after  service  of  a
      certified  copy of the order upon such person does not provide access or
      refuses to allow access to the person authorized to enter may  be  found
      guilty  of  contempt  of  court  and  may be required to pay a fine of a
      maximum of two hundred fifty dollars for willfully failing to provide or
      refusing to allow access. Service of the order shall  be  as  the  court
      directs  or  by  personal  service  but  if such cannot be made with due
      diligence within five days, service may be made by posting a copy of the
      order in a conspicuous place in the premises which is the subject of the
      order, and by sending a copy thereof by certified mail,  return  receipt
      requested,  to such person at his or her last known address. Such person
      shall not be in contempt of court or be required to pay a fine if he  or
      she  establishes  good and sufficient reason for a failure to be present
      when access was demanded.
        f. Nothing herein shall be deemed to authorize an officer or inspector
      of the department to enter any premises or part thereof if a  person  to
      whom an order is directed does not provide or refuses access.
        g.  Nothing herein shall affect the validity of inspections authorized
      and conducted under any other  provision  of  law,  rule  or  regulation
      without  the  issuance  of  an  inspection  warrant  as provided in this
      article.
