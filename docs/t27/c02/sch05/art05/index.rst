Section 27-2125 ::    
        
     
        ยง  27-2125  Power  to  cause  or  order  corrections of violations. a.
      Whenever the department determines that because of any violation of this
      chapter or other applicable law, any dwelling or part of its premises is
      dangerous to human life and safety or detrimental to health, it may
        (1) correct such conditions, or
        (2) order the owner of the dwelling  or  other  responsible  party  to
      correct such conditions.
        b.  Where the department determines that any violation of this chapter
      or other applicable law exists in any dwelling or part of its  premises,
      it  may  order  the  owner of the dwelling or other responsible party to
      correct such conditions.
        c. An order issued pursuant to the preceding subdivisions shall  state
      the violations involved and the corrective action to be taken, and shall
      fix  a time for compliance, which shall be not less than twenty-one days
      from the date of service of the order, except  that  where  a  condition
      dangerous to human life and safety or detrimental to health exists or is
      threatened, a shorter period for compliance may be fixed.
        d.  Any  order not complied with within the stated time for compliance
      may be executed by the department. Where a multiple  dwelling  has  been
      declared a public nuisance pursuant to section 27-2114 of article one of
      this subchapter, and an order to correct the conditions constituting the
      nuisance  has  not  been complied with, the department shall execute the
      order pursuant to this subdivision or institute proceedings pursuant  to
      article six of this subchapter.
    
    
    
    
    
    
    

Section 27-2127
---------------

Section 27-2127 ::    
        
     
        ยง 27-2127 Corrective action pursuant to court order. a. The department
      may  elect  to  proceed  to take action to correct violations under this
      article pursuant to a prior court order. If the department so elects, it
      may serve, with any order served pursuant  to  subdivision  a  or  b  of
      section  27-2125  of  this article, a notice that upon failure to comply
      with the order within the stated time the department  may  apply  for  a
      court order directing it to execute the repair order.
        b.  Upon failure to comply with the repair order within the time fixed
      therein, the department may apply to a court of  competent  jurisdiction
      for an order directing the owner and any mortgagees or lienors of record
      to  show  cause why the department should not be directed to execute the
      order, and obtain a lien for the costs of  such  execution  which  shall
      have  priority  over  all  other liens and encumbrances. The application
      shall identify the dwelling, describe  the  violations  covered  by  the
      repair  order,  the  work  required  to  remedy  such  violations and an
      estimate of the cost thereof, and contain proof of service of the repair
      order as required by this section.
        c. The order to show cause shall be served in  the  manner  prescribed
      for  service  of  an order to show cause in a receivership proceeding by
      subdivision c of section 27-2132 of article six of this subchapter.
        d. On the return date  of  the  order  to  show  cause,  determination
      thereof  shall  have  precedence  over every other business of the court
      unless the court shall find that some other pending  proceeding,  having
      similar  statutory preference, has priority. If the court finds that the
      facts stated in the application warrant the granting thereof,  it  shall
      issue an order directing the department to proceed to execute its repair
      order, or such part thereof as remains unexecuted.
        e.  If  the owner or any mortgagee or lienor of record or other person
      having an interest in the property, shall  apply  to  the  court  to  be
      permitted  to  remove  or  remedy the violations specified in the repair
      order and shall: (1) demonstrate the ability promptly to  undertake  the
      work  required; and (2) post security for the performance thereof within
      the time, and in the amount and manner, deemed necessary by  the  court,
      then  the court in lieu of issuing an order as provided in subdivision d
      of this section, may issue an order permitting such  person  to  perform
      the work within a time fixed by the court.
        f.  If,  after  issuance of an order pursuant to subdivision e of this
      section, but before the time fixed in such order for the  completion  of
      the  work prescribed therein, it shall appear to the department that the
      person permitted to do the same is not proceeding  with  due  diligence,
      the  department  may  apply  to the court on notice to those persons who
      have appeared in the hearing under subdivision d of this section  for  a
      hearing  to determine whether an order should be rendered immediately as
      provided in subdivision g of this section.
        g. If, upon a hearing authorized in subdivision f of this section, the
      court shall determine that  such  person  is  not  proceeding  with  due
      diligence,  or  upon  the failure of such person to complete the work in
      accordance with the provisions of said order, the court shall order  the
      department  to  execute  or  complete  the execution of said order. Such
      order shall direct the department to apply the security to the  expenses
      incurred  in  the  execution of the repair order. In the event that such
      security should exceed the amount required  to  remove  or  remedy  such
      violations,  such  order  shall  direct  the department to file with the
      court, upon completion of the work prescribed therein, a full accounting
      of the amount of such security and the  expenditures  made  pursuant  to
      such  order, and to turn over such surplus to the person who posted such
      security, together with a copy of such accounting.

      department pursuant to  section  27-2125  or  section  27-2127  of  this
      article  shall  constitute  a debt recoverable from the owner and a lien
      upon the building and lot, and upon the rents and other income  thereof.
      The  provisions  of  article  eight  of this subchapter shall govern the
      effect and enforcement of such debt and lien.

Section 27-2129 ::    
        
     
        ยง  27-2129  Statement of account. Whenever the department has incurred
      expenses for the repair of a dwelling or  for  the  elimination  of  any
      dangerous  or  unlawful  conditions therein, pursuant to this article or
      any other provision of the administrative code or any  other  applicable
      provision  of law, the department, its authorized representative, or the
      department of finance may send to the owner or his or  her  designee  in
      the  manner  provided  in  section  11-129  of the administrative code a
      statement of account with the expense incurred and a demand for  payment
      thereof.  If  the owner does not notify the department in writing of his
      or her objection to the  first  statement  of  account  containing  such
      charge  before  the  date  that  such  charge becomes due and payable as
      provided in subdivision b of section 27-2144 of article  eight  of  this
      subchapter,   such   owner   may  not  in  any  subsequent  judicial  or
      administrative  proceeding  contest  the  expense  contained   in   such
      statement.  The  department  will  only  review such objections that are
      received by it in writing on or prior to the due and  payable  date  for
      the  charge  provided on the second statement of account containing such
      charge.
