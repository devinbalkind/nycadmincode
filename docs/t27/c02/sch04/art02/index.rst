        ยง  27-2098  Registration  statement;  contents.  a.  The  registration
      statement shall include the following information:
        (1) An identification of the premises by block and lot number, and  by
      the  street numbers and names of all streets contiguous to the dwelling,
      or by such other description as will enable the department to locate the
      dwelling. If the dwelling is a garden-type maisonette  dwelling  project
      required  to  register  pursuant to paragraph four of subdivision (b) of
      section  27-2099  of  this  article,  the  owner  who  files  the  first
      registration  statement  with the department for such project shall list
      on the registration statement the street numbers for  each  dwelling  in
      the  project  and  shall  designate  an  address  by  which  the project
      dwellings are to be identified by the department.
        (2) An identification of the owner by  name,  residence  and  business
      address. If the owner is a corporation, the identification shall include
      the  name  and  address  of  such  corporation  together with the names,
      residences and business addresses of the officers. If  the  owner  of  a
      multiple  dwelling  is  a  corporation,  the  identification  shall also
      include the names and addresses of any person whose share  of  ownership
      of the corporation exceeds twenty-five percent. For the purposes of this
      subdivision,  any person owning a share of a parent corporation shall be
      deemed to be an owner of a share of a subsidiary  corporation  equal  to
      the  product  of  the  percentage  of his or her ownership of the parent
      corporation multiplied by the percentage  of  the  parent  corporation's
      ownership  of  the  subsidiary  corporation.  If the owner of a multiple
      dwelling is a partnership, the identification shall include the name and
      business address  of  such  partnership  together  with  the  names  and
      business  addresses of each general partner and for each limited partner
      whose share of ownership of the partnership exceeds twenty-five percent,
      the names and business addresses of all such limited  partners.  If  the
      owner is under the age of eighteen years or has been judicially declared
      incompetent, his or her legal representative shall file the registration
      statement.
        (3)  If the dwelling is a multiple dwelling, the name and address of a
      managing agent  designated  by  the  owner  to  be  in  control  of  and
      responsible  for  the  maintenance and operation of such dwelling and to
      authorize, on behalf of the  owner,  the  correction  of  any  emergency
      conditions or the making of any emergency repairs for which the owner is
      responsible  under  the  provisions of the multiple dwelling law or this
      code. To qualify for such designation,  an  agent  shall  be  a  natural
      person over the age of twenty-one years and shall reside within the city
      or  customarily and regularly attend a business office maintained within
      the city. An owner or corporate officer who  meets  such  qualifications
      may be designated to serve and registered as the managing agent.
        (4)  If  the  dwelling  is a multiple dwelling or a one- or two-family
      dwelling where neither the owner nor  any  family  member  occupies  the
      dwelling,  the  number  of  a  telephone within the greater metropolitan
      area, as identified by the department, where an owner or officer, if the
      owner is a corporation, or the managing agent may reasonably be expected
      to be reached at all  times.  The  telephone  number  contained  in  the
      registration statement shall not constitute a public record and shall be
      accessible  only  to  duly  authorized  employees  or  officers  of  the
      department and used exclusively by such personnel in connection with  an
      emergency  arising  on  the  premises for which the owner is responsible
      under the provisions of the multiple dwelling  law  or  this  code.  The
      department  may  promulgate  regulations  to implement the provisions of
      this paragraph.
        (5) If the dwelling is a one- or two-family dwelling and  neither  the
      owner  nor any family member occupies the dwelling, the name and address
    
      of a natural person who is over  the  age  of  twenty-one  years  and  a
      resident  of  the  city,  designated  by the owner to receive service of
      notices, orders or summonses issued by the department.
        (6)  For  the purposes of this section, a United States postal service
      mail delivery box, a mail delivery box maintained  through  a  privately
      operated  mail  handling  facility  or  the address at which any similar
      service is provided shall be deemed an invalid business address and  the
      department  shall  not  accept  for  filing  any  registration statement
      containing only such an address.
        b. The registration statement shall be signed by the owner or, if  the
      owner  is a corporation, by any officer. In the appropriate case, either
      the managing agent or  the  designee  described  in  paragraph  five  of
      subdivision  a  of  this  section  shall  sign the statement to indicate
      consent to the designation except that such consent is not  required  if
      an  owner  or  officer  of  a  corporation is registered as the managing
      agent.
        c. The registration statement shall be filed on forms to be prescribed
      by the department and shall be accompanied by a filing fee  of  thirteen
      dollars.  In  the  case  of  an  owner  previously  registered  with the
      department, no new filing fee shall be required  for  the  filing  of  a
      supplemental registration.
        d.  The  department  may require that a multiple dwelling registration
      statement contain such other information, in addition to the information
      specifically required by this article, which it deems to be  related  to
      the ownership or management of such dwelling.

Section 27-2099 ::

      When the owner of a dwelling, who is required  to  register  under  this
      article, conveys title to the dwelling to another, the transferor shall,
      on  the  day  of such transfer, notify the department by regular mail of
      the name, residence and business address of the new owner,  or,  if  the
      new owner is a corporation, of the name and address of such corporation.
      The  registration  statement  in accordance with section 27-2098 of this
      article shall be presented by  the  new  owner  to  the  office  of  the
      register  of  the  city  of New York, or the county clerk as required by
      subdivision c of this section if such owner records such deed, or to the
      department if the deed is not recorded, and in no event more  than  five
      days  from  the  date  of taking of title; however, the failure by a new
      owner to file such registration statement shall not impair the  validity
      of his or her title.
        b.  When  the ownership of a dwelling changes by operation of law, the
      new owner, if required to register, shall file a registration  statement
      in  accordance with section 27-2098 of this article not more than thirty
      days from the date that title devolved upon him or her.
        c. The office of the register of the city of New York or county  clerk
      shall  not record or accept for recording any deed transferring title to
      real property or a lease or memorandum of lease of  an  entire  multiple
      dwelling  unless  such  instrument  is  accompanied  by the registration
      statements required under this article, with their appropriate fees,  or
      an affidavit stating that the deed, or lease or memorandum of lease does
      not  affect  a  multiple dwelling and such registration is not required.
      Such registration statements and the fees therefor shall be forwarded to
      the department for filing and acceptance.
        d. (1) Notwithstanding any other provision of law, after  thirty  days
      have elapsed from the date that title to a dwelling is conveyed to a new
      owner or devolves upon a new owner by operation of law, if the new owner
      has not filed a registration statement in relation to such dwelling, the
      department may invalidate the former owner's last valid registration for
      such  dwelling  upon  application  by  such former owner for the limited
      purpose of service of notices or orders  authorized  or  required  under
      this  code to be served by the department upon the last registered owner
      or last registered managing agent. To effect such limited  invalidation,
      the  former  owner shall submit such documentation as is satisfactory to
      the department that the ownership of the dwelling has changed  and  that
      such  former  owner no longer owns the dwelling; provided, however, that
      such  registration  shall  remain  valid  for  all  purposes  until  the
      department  informs  such former owner in writing that such registration
      has been invalidated for such limited purpose.
        (2) Where a notice or order is authorized or required under this  code
      to  be  served  by the department upon the last registered owner or last
      registered managing agent and the department has  invalidated  the  last
      valid registration pursuant to paragraph one of this subdivision for the
      limited  purpose  of  service  of notices or orders, such service may be
      made by personal delivery of the notice or order to a person  in  direct
      or  indirect control of the premises or by mailing a copy thereof to the
      attention of "owner" or "managing agent"  at  such  dwelling;  provided,
      however,  that such manner of service is authorized only until such time
      as a valid registration is subsequently filed for the dwelling.

      date.  Such  notice  shall  include,  but  need  not  be limited to, the
      following  information:  (i)  the  name  of  the   mortgagee   plaintiff
      commencing  such  action  and  the mailing address, telephone number and

        2. A mortgagee shall notify the department within fifteen days of  the
      discontinuance  of  an action for which notice pursuant to paragraph one
      of this subdivision has been received by the department, the issuance of
      a judgment in such action, or the sale of the real property as a  result
      of such action.
        3.  The  department  shall  maintain  on  its  website  a  list of all
      properties with twenty or more units, identified by block and lot number
      along with the  name,  mailing  address  and  telephone  number  of  the
      mortgagee  plaintiff  and  the  name  of  the defendant for which notice
      pursuant to paragraph one of this subdivision has  been  received.  Such
      list  shall  be  updated  at a minimum on the first business day of each
      month. The department shall report on its website each three months: (i)

      provided to it pursuant to paragraphs one and two of this subdivision to
      one or more agencies for  which  the  department  determines  that  such
      information  furthers such agency or agencies' duties, including but not
      limited to the enforcement of section 28-210.1 of this code  or  related
      provisions, and to any other city agency upon request by such agency.
        b. Any mortgagee who fails to notify the department in accordance with
      subdivision  a  of  this  section  shall  be  liable for a civil penalty
      enforceable by the department. Such civil penalty shall not  exceed  one
      thousand  dollars  for  each week that there is a failure to notify. The
      failure to notify shall not be deemed to affect in any way  any  pending
      legal proceeding related to such residential real property.
    
        c.  The  provisions of this section shall not apply to any foreclosure
      actions brought by a governmental entity.
