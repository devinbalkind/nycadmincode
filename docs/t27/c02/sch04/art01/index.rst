        1. Such order may be issued to an owner of a building that  meets  the
      criteria promulgated by the department in rules.
        2.  The  department  may  file  such order in the office of the county
      clerk in the county in which the building is located. Where  such  order

      or orally at a designated location.
        (3) Upon the  expiration  of  such  thirty  day  comment  period,  the
      commissioner  may  (i)  determine that no harassment has occurred within
      the stated period of time and forthwith grant such  certification,  (ii)
      determine  that  a  waiver  of  certification may be granted pursuant to
      subdivision e of this section and forthwith grant such waiver, or  (iii)
      deny  such  certification  without  a  prior hearing if there has been a
      finding by the office of rent  control,  the  conciliation  and  appeals
      board  or  any court having jurisdiction that there has been harassment,
      unlawful eviction or arson by or on behalf of the owner at the  multiple
      dwelling  for  which certification is sought during the stated period of
      time; or (iv) where there has been no prior determination of harassment,
      unlawful eviction or arson by or on behalf of the owner, provide that  a
      hearing  be  held  in  the  manner  provided  in section 27-2092 of this
      article if  the  commissioner  has  reasonable  cause  to  believe  that
      harassment  has  occurred  within  such stated period of time and that a

      of  the  multiple dwelling for which such certification is sought, shall

      review pursuant to article seventy-eight of the civil practice  law  and

      unless the applicant submits a sworn statement,  in  such  form  as  the
      commissioner shall prescribe, by all the owners of the multiple dwelling
      representing  that  there will be no harassment of the occupants of such
      multiple dwelling by or  on  behalf  of  such  owners.  The  corporation
      counsel may institute any action or proceeding in any court of competent
      jurisdiction that may be appropriate or necessary for the enforcement of
      this  representation  and  agreement.  Nothing  contained  herein  shall
    
      preclude an occupant of such multiple dwelling from applying on  his  or
      her own behalf for similar relief.
        *  (6)  The  commissioner  shall  promulgate  rules and regulations to

      during  the  thirty-six month period prior to the date of the submission
      of  an  application  for  a  certification  of  no  harassment  if   the
      commissioner finds that:
        (1)  (a)  the owner of record of the multiple dwelling with respect to
      which such certification is sought was  the  owner  of  record  of  such
      multiple  dwelling  prior to May fifth, nineteen hundred eighty-three or
      had entered into a contract of sale for the purchase  of  such  multiple
      dwelling  which  was  recorded  prior to such date or, with respect to a
      certification proceeding where the alterations sought  to  be  performed

      period of time in which such harassment occurred and  did  not  at  such
      multiple   dwelling   (i)   otherwise  engage  or  participate  in  such
      harassment; or (ii) with intent that harassment be performed, agree with
      one or more persons to engage in or cause the performance of harassment;
      or (iii) with intent that another person engage in conduct  constituting
      harassment, solicit, request, command, importune or otherwise attempt to
      cause such person to engage in conduct constituting harassment; and
        (c) such owner acquired title pursuant to a bona fide transaction that
      is not intended to evade the provisions of this section; or
        (2)  the  owner  acquired  the  multiple  dwelling by sale pursuant to
      foreclosure of a mortgage or pursuant to a deed in lieu  of  foreclosure
      of  a  mortgage; provided, however, that such conveyance was a bona fide

      evade the provisions of this section and either
        (i)  a  certification  of  no harassment or waiver thereof was granted
      with respect to such multiple dwelling within a sixty day  period  prior
      to  the  date  of  the  recording  of such mortgage and no suspension or
      rescission thereof was recorded prior to such date; or

        (3)  In  determining  whether  such  transaction  was  bona  fide, the
      commissioner may consider whether at such multiple dwelling or any other
      such  multiple  dwelling  such  owner  did  (i)  otherwise   engage   or
      participate  in  harassment;  or  (ii)  with  intent  that harassment be
      performed, agree with one or more persons to  engage  in  or  cause  the
      performance  of  harassment;  or  (iii)  with intent that another person

        (4) A waiver of a certification pursuant  to  this  subdivision  shall
      state the findings of the commissioner.
        f.  (1)  The commissioner may rescind a certification of no harassment

      occurred   at   the   multiple  dwelling  with  respect  to  which  such
      certification or waiver thereof was issued  after  the  period  of  time
      covered   by  such  certification  but  prior  to  the  commencement  of
      substantial work pursuant to an alteration permit or  demolition  permit
      issued on the basis of such certification or waiver thereof.
        (2)  If  the  commissioner  has  reasonable cause to believe that such
      harassment  has   occurred,   the   commissioner   shall   suspend   the
      certification of no harassment or waiver thereof and upon the request of
      the  commissioner,  the  commissioner of buildings shall not approve any
      plans or issue an alteration or demolition permit with  respect  to  the
      alteration  or  demolition  of  such multiple dwelling or, if such plans
      have been approved and an  alteration  or  demolition  permit  has  been
      issued  with respect to such alteration or demolition, issue a stop-work
      notice and order pursuant to section 27-227 of  article  twenty-four  of
      subchapter  one of the building code. Notice of such suspension shall be
      mailed to the owner of record of such multiple  dwelling  and  shall  be
      filed with the city register.
        (3)  As  soon  as  reasonably possible, but not later than thirty days
      after such suspension, the commissioner shall  hold  a  hearing  in  the
      manner  provided  in  section  27-2092  of this article upon appropriate
      notice and  shall  determine  whether  to  rescind  such  certification;
      provided,  however,  that  if,  prior to the commencement of substantial
      work, the owner has been found  by  the  office  of  rent  control,  the
      conciliation and appeals board or any court having jurisdiction, to have
      engaged  in  harassment,  unlawful  eviction  or  arson  at the multiple
      dwelling,  the  commissioner  may  rescind  such  certification  without
      holding  a hearing.  At such hearing the owner shall have an opportunity
      to be heard by the commissioner or a designee of the commissioner.
        (4) If the commissioner determines not to rescind such  certification,
      the  commissioner  shall  notify  the  commissioner of buildings of such
      determination  and  any  stop-work  notice  and  order  issued  by   the
      commissioner  of buildings pursuant to paragraph two of this subdivision
      shall be vacated immediately. Notice  of  such  determination  shall  be
      mailed  to  the owner of record of such multiple dwelling and filed with
      the city register.
        (5) If the commissioner determines that such  certification  shall  be
      rescinded,  notice of such determination accompanied by written findings
      indicating the grounds for such determination shall be provided  to  the
      commissioner  of buildings and shall be mailed to the owner of record of
      such  multiple  dwelling  and  filed  with  the  city   register.   Such
    
      determination   shall   be   subject   to  review  pursuant  to  article
      seventy-eight of the civil practice law and rules.
        (g)  For  the  purpose of any subsequent certification proceeding with
      respect to such multiple dwelling pursuant to this section, the granting
      of a certification of no harassment or a waiver thereof for  any  period
      of  time shall be conclusive proof only for the purposes of this section
      that either no harassment occurred within the  time  period  covered  by
      such  certification  or  that  the waiver of such certification for such
      period of time was appropriate.
        h. The commissioner is authorized to establish and collect  reasonable
      fees  and  charges  from  applicants  for  the  administrative  expenses
      incurred by the department for the certification proceedings  prescribed
      in this section, including costs for publication and notices.

      subchapter,  by  mailing  a  copy  thereof  to  the  latest  business or
      residence  address  of  such  managing  agent  set  forth  in  any  such
      registration  statement  or  designation  filed  by  the  owner  of such
      dwelling;
        (iii) If service is to be made on an owner of a dwelling who  has  not
      filed  such a registration statement in relation to such dwelling, or on
      a managing agent of any such dwelling who has not been designated  under
      the  applicable provisions of article two of this subchapter, by posting
      a copy of such notice or order in a conspicuous place in such  dwelling,
      or  by  delivering  a  copy  thereof  to  any person of suitable age and
      discretion in charge of or apparently in charge of such dwelling, or  by
      mailing a copy thereof to such owner or managing agent at the last known
      business or residence address of such owner or managing agent.
        b. Any such notice directed to an owner of a dwelling or tenant of any
      space therein need not designate such owner or tenant by name, but shall
      refer  to  such  dwelling  or  space  by  a  description  which shall be
      sufficient to identify same and shall state that it is directed  to  the
      owner of such dwelling or tenant of such space, as the case may be.
        c.  Where  a  designation  of  a  managing  agent under the applicable
      provisions of article two of this subchapter is currently in  effect  as
      to  any multiple dwelling, any notice mentioned in subdivision a of this
      section which is directed to the owner of such multiple  dwelling  shall
      also  be  directed  to  such  managing agent, and shall be served by the
      department on both such owner and managing agent.
        d. If a  mortgagee  or  lienor  has  registered  with  the  department
      pursuant  to  the  provisions  of section 27-2109 of article two of this
      subchapter, any notice of  violation  or  other  notice,  or  any  order
      authorized  or  required  to  be  served  by  the  department  under the
      provisions of this code on the owner of a dwelling may also be mailed to
      such mortgagee or lienor no later than five days  after  the  date  upon
      which   such  notice  or  order  is  served  upon  the  owner,  but  the
      department's failure to mail such notice or order to such  mortgagee  or
      lienor  shall  not  in  any  way  affect the validity of service of such
      notice or order upon the owner.
