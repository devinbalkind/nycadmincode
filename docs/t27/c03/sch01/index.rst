        b. Examination of Applicant.
        1.   Every   application   for   a  master  electrician's  or  special

      Business, generally.
        1.  Every  master electrician business shall at all times have a place
      of business at a specified address in the city at which the licensee may
      be contacted by the public and the  department  by  mail,  telephone  or
      other  modes  of communication, located in a business zone in conformity
      with the zoning regulations and kept  open  during  the  usual  business
      hours unless other means acceptable to the commissioner is provided.
        2.  At such place of business, there shall at all times be prominently
      displayed a permanent sign of a minimum size of one hundred fifty square
      inches, stating the name of such license holder, the license  number  of
      such  licensee,  and  the  words  "licensed  electrician"  or  "licensed
      electrical contractor" on a plate glass  window  and  the  name  of  the
      master  electrician  business  if different than the name of the license
      holder; or an  outside  sign  of  permanent  construction  fastened  and
      readily  visible  to  pedestrians;  or  if  such place of business be an
      office, commercial or industrial building, the names shall be  indicated
      on  the  entrance door of the particular portion of the premises or on a
      bulletin board on the main floor.
        3. All business vehicles, advertising, websites and stationery used in
      connection with electrical work required to be performed under a license
      issued to a master  electrician  shall  display  prominently  the  words
      "N.Y.C.  Licensed  Electrician",  the  license number of the responsible
      representative of such business and of  all  other  master  electricians

      electrician business and  the  business  address.  If  the  business  is
      conducted  under  a  trade name, or is a partnership or corporation, the
      trade name, partnership, or corporate name shall contain the  root  word
      "electric" and be displayed prominently.
        4. The applicant for approval of a master electrician business under a
      license  issued  to  a  master  electrician  shall  have  filed with the
      commissioner, in such form as the commissioner may  direct,  proof  that
      such  applicant carries all insurance required by law including, but not
      limited to, workers' compensation, disability and one million dollars of
      general  liability  insurance  listing  the  department  as  certificate
      holder, and that the applicant business is financially responsible. Each
      policy  of  insurance  shall contain a provision of continuing liability
      notwithstanding any recovery under such policy.
        5. The applicant shall indicate the name and  license  number  of  the
      master  electrician who shall serve as the responsible representative of
      such business, and, if the business is a partnership or corporation, the
      names of all other master electricians associated  with  such  business.
      Upon  approval  of  such  application  the  commissioner  shall issue an
      authorization number to the business. The authorization number shall  be
      included  on  all  applications  for  permits  and  any  other documents
      required to be filed with the department.
        6. The office or other place where the master electrician business  is
      to  be  conducted  may  be  shared  by  one  or  more master electrician
      businesses.   However, each business whether  in  the  form  of  a  sole
      proprietorship,   partnership  or  corporation,  shall  distinguish  its
      identity from any other business sharing the  same  office  space.  Such
      distinctions  shall  be  maintained  in  a  manner  satisfactory  to the
      department.
        b. Business Conduct
        1. A master electrician business shall be principally engaged  in  the
      business  of  performing electrical work in or on buildings, premises or
      lots in the city.
    
        2. In the case of a partnership or corporation, a master electrician's
      license may be separately held by more than one partner or officer as  a
      representative  of  such  partnership  or corporation; however, only one
      master electrician shall  be  the  responsible  representative  of  such
      corporation  or  partnership.  Under  no  circumstances  shall  any  one
      licensee represent more than one business at any one time.
        3. A master electrician representing  a  master  electrician  business
      shall,  during  the  hours the business is engaged in the performance of
      electrical work, devote his or her full time to the  operation  of  such
      business.
        4.  (i)  Applications  for  permits  and  any  other document that the
      commissioner may require to be filed with the department, shall bear the
      stamp of the master electrician's seal as well as the signature  of  the
      responsible representative of the master electrician business or, if the
      business  is  a  partnership  or corporation, such document may bear the
      stamp of the seal and the signature of a master electrician who files on
      behalf of such business acting pursuant to a written  delegation,  filed
      with  the  department,  from  the  responsible  representative  of  such
      business. For applications and other documents submitted electronically,
      the digital signature and imprint of the seal  may  be  submitted  in  a
      manner authorized by the commissioner.
        (ii)  The  responsible  representative  of a business may not delegate
      such authority to a master electrician who is not  an  officer  of  such
      corporation  or  a  partner  of  such  partnership.  Such  person  shall
      personally sign applications for permits. The responsible representative
      of a business shall have the authority to make final determinations  and
      shall have full responsibility for the manner in which the work is done,
      except  that  where  work  is  done under a permit issued pursuant to an
      application bearing the signature  and  seal  of  a  master  electrician
      acting   pursuant   to   a   written  delegation  from  the  responsible
      representative of such business, both the responsible representative  of
      such  business  and the master electrician who signed and affixed his or
      her seal to the  application  for  such  permit  shall  be  jointly  and
      severally responsible for the manner in which the work is done.
        c. Changes to Business.
        1.  The  holder  of  a  master  electrician's  license shall report in
      writing to the license board any change in the place of business  within
      thirty  (30) days of the change. If such change occurs prior to issuance
      of the license, an applicant shall report  the  change  to  the  license
      board within fourteen (14) days of the change.
        2. The approval of a master electrician business is valid only as long
      as  the  responsible  representative  identified  on the application for
      approval of the master electrician business actively participates in the
      actual  operation  of  the  business.  In  the   event   a   responsible
      representative   leaves   a   master   electrician  business,  both  the
      representative and the business must notify  the  license  board  within
      thirty (30) days of the change.
        (i)  A corporation or partnership must notify the license board of the
      death of a responsible representative within thirty (30) days after such
      death. Failure to do so shall be deemed sufficient cause for  suspending
      or  revoking  the  approval  to  do  business  of the master electrician
      business  or  the  license  of  the  master  electrician.  The  decedent
      licensee's  legal  representative  may, with the commissioner's consent,
      retain the licensee's license and seal for the purpose of completing all
      unfinished work of such licensee for which plans have been approved  and
      permits  issued,  provided  that  such work is performed by or under the
      direct supervision of a licensed electrician.
    
        (ii) Except as  otherwise  provided  by  rule,  a  master  electrician
      business  whether  in the form of a corporation, a partnership or a sole
      proprietorship, may continue to engage in  the  business  of  performing
      electrical  work  only so long as the responsible representative of such
      business  identified  on  the  application  for  approval  of the master
      electrician business remains an officer of such corporation,  a  partner
      of such partnership or the proprietor of such sole proprietorship unless
      the  department  approves  a change in the responsible representative as
      provided  in  this  section.  The  commissioner  may  promulgate   rules
      providing  for the continuation of a master electrician business pending
      the approval of a new responsible representative.
        (iii) Except as otherwise provided  in  such  rules,  the  revocation,
      suspension,   license   deactivation   or   non-renewal  of  the  master
      electrician's license of the  responsible  representative  of  a  master
      electrician  business  automatically revokes its approval to do business
      and cancels any  delegation  of  authority  given  by  such  responsible
      representative  to  another  master  electrician  associated  with  such
      business pending the approval by the department  of  a  new  responsible
      representative.
        3. Except as otherwise provided by rule, a master electrician business
      shall  not  change  its  name,  form  or  designate  a  new  responsible
      representative without the prior approval of the license board. Approval
      of an application for a change is conditional upon the following: filing
      the necessary forms, payment of the prescribed fee and full  payment  of
      all fees incurred with respect to such business prior to the date of the
      change.  Except  as otherwise provided by rule, a requested change shall
      not be approved if  there  are  any  outstanding  fees  related  to  the
      licensee's  or  master  electrician business's professional dealings due
      and  owing  to  the  department   or   outstanding   violation   notices
      attributable to the licensee or the master electrician business.
        4.  A master electrician's license and a special electrician's license
      and seal shall not be held by any person at the same time.
        5. The  holder  of  a  master  electrician's  license,  upon  entering
      employment  as a special electrician, shall deactivate his or her master
      electrician's  license  and  seal  and  change   over   to   a   special
      electrician's  license  and  seal  to  cover the building, buildings, or
      parts thereof, for which he or she will be employed.
        6. Nothing in this chapter shall be construed to prevent two  or  more
      master  electrician  businesses  from  entering  into a joint venture of
      limited duration for a particular project in accordance with  the  rules
      of the department. An application for a permit involving a joint venture
      shall  so  indicate  on  the  application  and shall identify all of the
      master electrician businesses that are parties to such joint venture  by
      name  and  authorization number and the names and license numbers of the
      responsible representatives of such businesses. The application shall be
      signed by the responsible representative of one of the  parties  to  the
      joint  venture  on  behalf  of  all such parties and all of such parties
      shall be jointly and severally liable for any fees due with  respect  to
      electrical  work  performed  by such joint venture and for violations of
      this chapter and the rules of the department arising out of such work.

      expiration,   the  commissioner  may,  upon  submission  of  a  complete
      application  for  late  renewal  within  ninety  (90)  days  after   the
      expiration of such license, permit the issuance, without examination, of
      a  new license and seal upon payment of the prescribed fees for such new
      license  and  seal  within  said  ninety  days.  The  commissioner   may
      promulgate  rules  authorizing the renewal of a license up to six months
      after the expiration of such license for extenuating circumstances.
        2. No license shall be renewed and no new license and  seal  shall  be
      issued  unless  all outstanding fees required by section 27-3018 of this
      code have been paid.
        3. Renewal  shall  also  be  subject  to  the  licensee's  good  moral
      character.    As  provided in department rule, the licensee's failure to
      clear open violations in a timely manner may result in  the  refusal  to
      renew a license until the violations are resolved.
        4.  The commissioner may promulgate rules requiring applicants for the
      renewal of master or special electrician's licenses to submit proof,  in
      such  form  as  he  or  she  shall  determine, that, in each year of the
      license  term,  such  applicant  completed  at  least  eight  hours   of
      continuing  education  courses  approved  by  the department. Such proof
      shall be submitted with the license renewal application.
        b. If a master  electrician's  or  special  electrician's  license  is
      suspended  for  cause,  and  the restoration thereof is conditional upon
      some action to be taken by the holder of  the  master  electrician's  or
      special electrician's license and the holder fails to take action before
      the  expiration  of  the  license,  such  failure shall be cause for the
      denial of the subsequent application to renew the license and seal.

      installation of an additional branch circuit;
        (x) installation of motors of fractional horsepower;
        (xi)  installation  of transformers rated at one thousand volt amperes
      or less.
        2. Notwithstanding any other provision of this chapter, an  electrical
      sign-off  by  the  department  shall not be required for electrical work
      performed pursuant to a permit for minor electrical work.
        3.  Notwithstanding  any  other  provision  of   this   chapter,   the
      commissioner  may promulgate a rule providing that minor electrical work
      may be performed without a permit or the payment  of  a  fee  under  the
      conditions to be prescribed in such rule.
        i.  The  department  shall  not  issue  a permit or, if applicable, an
      electrical  sign-off  pursuant  to  an  application  that  involves  the
      energizing of a meter in a one-, two-, three-, or four-family residence,
      if  the department finds that such action will cause the total number of
      meters for the building to exceed the number of dwelling units specified
      for such building in the certificate of occupancy, or  if  there  is  no
      certificate  of  occupancy,  as  determined by the department, except as
      permitted herein. A building specified as a one-family residence in  the
      certificate of occupancy or, if there is no certificate of occupancy, as
      determined  by  the  department,  may  have  only  one electric meter. A
      building in which two or more dwelling units have  been  constructed  in
      accordance  with  the  certificate  of  occupancy,  or  if  there  is no
      certificate of occupancy, as determined by the department, may have  one
      meter  for  each  dwelling  unit and one additional meter for the common
      areas of  the  building,  provided  that  smoke  detecting  devices  are
      installed   in   all   common  areas  in  accordance  with  departmental
      requirements. Such common areas may include boiler rooms, shared hallway
      lighting, shared stairway lighting, and outdoor perimeter  lighting  but
      shall  not  include  any  habitable space. In the event that a meter has
      been found to have been installed or  to  exist  in  violation  of  this
      section,  the department may take action leading to the disconnecting of
      such meter in accordance with  the  notice  requirements  set  forth  in
      section 27-3020 of this chapter.
        j.  Any application for a permit filed with the department in relation
      to a request for  the  authorization  to  power  or  energize/electrical
      wiring  or  appliances  or power generation equipment, or in relation to
      work that will result in the issuance of a new or amended certificate of
      occupancy  must  include  a  statement,  signed  and   sealed   by   the
      electrician,   that   the  building  owner  or  his  or  her  authorized
      representative has authorized in writing the work to be performed.  This
      signed  authorization  must be available upon request by the department.
      In addition,  any  electrical  application  filed  with  the  department
      involving  the energizing of a meter, must include as well, a statement,
      signed and sealed by the electrician, that the building owner or his  or
      her  authorized representative has indicated in writing the intended use
      or purpose of such meter and  has  affirmed  that  such  meter  will  be
    
      maintained  in  compliance  with  the provisions of this section.   This
      statement must be available upon request by the department.
        k.  Any  authorization  to  power  or  energize  electrical  wiring or
      appliances issued by the department shall expire ninety days  after  the
      date  of issuance unless a sign-off has been issued by the department or
      an extension of such authorization has been granted by  the  department.
      In the event no such sign-off has been issued or extension authorization
      granted,  the department may take action leading to the disconnecting of
      such meter(s) in accordance with the notice requirements  set  forth  in
      section 27-3020 of this chapter.
        l.  Any permit application filed with the department that requires the
      selective coordination of overcurrent protective  devices  must  include
      documentation  from  a professional engineer demonstrating how selective
      coordination was achieved, including but not limited  to  short  circuit
      overlay  curves  and calculations. Such documentation shall be submitted
      to the department prior to sign off.
        m. For permit applications requiring compliance  with  the  applicable
      energy conservation code, documentation demonstrating compliance must be
      available upon request by the department.
        n.  The  provisions  of  this  section  shall not apply to low voltage
      electrical work.
        o. An application for a work permit may be amended by filing with  the
      department a post-approval amendment in a form prescribed by rule of the
      department.

        § 27-3019 Modification, suspension or revocation, electrical sign-off,
      permit or other authorization. a. The commissioner may at any time by an
      order  in  writing  for  good cause shown, modify, suspend or revoke any
      sign-off, permit or other authorization issued pursuant to this  chapter
      for  failure  to  comply  with  the  provisions  of  this  code or other
      applicable laws or rules; or whenever there has been any false statement
      or any misrepresentation as to a material fact  in  the  application  or
      submittal documents upon the basis of which such approval was issued; or
      whenever  a permit has been issued in error and conditions are such that
      the permit should not have been issued. Such  notice  shall  inform  the
      permit holder of the reasons for the proposed action and that the permit
      holder  has  the  right  to  present  to  the commissioner or his or her
      representative within ten business days of delivery  of  the  notice  by
      hand  or  fifteen  calendar  days  of  the  posting  of  notice by mail,
      information as to why the permit should not be  modified,  suspended  or
      revoked. A copy of any such order shall be served in the manner provided
      in  this subchapter. No person other than the commissioner or an officer
      or  employee  of  the  department,  duly  authorized  thereto   by   the
      commissioner,  shall  alter  or  amend  any  sign-off,  permit  or other
      authorization issued pursuant to  this  chapter  or  the  rules  of  the
      department.
        b.  Immediate  suspension in cases of imminent peril. The commissioner
      may immediately suspend any permit without prior notice  to  the  permit
      holder  when  the  commissioner has determined that an imminent peril to
      life or property exists. The commissioner shall immediately  notify  the
      permit  holder  that  the  permit  has  been  suspended  and the reasons
      therefore, that it is proposed to be revoked, and that the permit holder
      has  the  right  to  present  to  the  commissioner  or   his   or   her
      representative  within  ten  business  days of delivery of the notice by
      hand or  fifteen  calendar  days  of  the  posting  of  notice  by  mail
      information as to why the permit should not be revoked.

        §  27-3020  Supplying or discontinuing electrical energy. a. Except as
      otherwise provided in this code, no person, partnership  or  corporation
      shall  supply,  or  cause  to be supplied or used, electrical energy for
      light, heat or power, signaling,  alarm  or  data  transmission  to  any
      wiring  or  appliance  in  any  building  unless  a  sign-off  or  other
      authorization as set forth in the rules of  the  department  authorizing
      the  use  of  said  wiring  or  appliance  shall have been issued by the
      commissioner.
        b. If, in the judgment of the commissioner, after due inspection,  the
      continued use of any electric wiring or appliances in or on any building
      or  structure  shall  be unsafe or dangerous to persons or property, the
      commissioner may cause such wires or appliances to be disconnected  from
      the supply of electrical energy and to seal the wiring and appliances so
      disconnected.  Thereafter,  no  person  shall cause or permit electrical
      energy to be supplied to the wiring or appliances so  sealed  until  the
      same  shall have been made safe and the commissioner shall have issued a
      certificate to  that  effect;  provided,  however,  that  no  wiring  or
      appliances shall be disconnected pursuant to this section until a notice
      in   writing,  stating  specifically  the  reason  why  such  wiring  or
      appliances must be disconnected, shall have been served, as provided  in
      this  chapter,  and a duplicate thereof shall have been delivered to the
      person supplying the electrical energy to such wiring or appliances.

Section 27-3021.1 ::    
        
     
        §  27-3021.1  Electric  meter  installation;  restriction.  No  public
      utility shall supply electricity to a one, two,  three  or  four  family
      residence  building,  nor  shall  such  utility energize more electrical
      meters in a building than the number of distinct and separate residences
      in  such  building  as  authorized  in  the  certificate  of   occupancy
      applicable  thereto,  or  if  there  is  no certificate of occupancy, as
      determined by the department, without first receiving  a  sign-off  from
      the department.  In the event that an owner of a one, two, three or four
      family  building  wants  to install an additional electrical meter other
      than provided for herein, approval shall be obtained in writing from the
      department.  A  public  utility  shall  not  install   such   additional
      electrical  meter without such approval. A building in which two or more
      dwelling units have been constructed in accordance with the  certificate
      of  occupancy, or if there is no certificate of occupancy, as determined
      by the department, may have one meter for each  dwelling  unit  and  one
      additional  meter  for  the  common areas of the building, provided that
      smoke detecting devices are installed in all common areas in  accordance
      with  departmental  requirements.  Such  common areas may include boiler
      rooms, shared hallway lighting, shared stairway  lighting,  and  outdoor
      perimeter  lighting  but  shall  not include any habitable space. In the
      event that a meter has been found to have been installed or to exist  in
      violation  of this section, the utility must report such findings to the
      department, which may take action leading to the disconnecting  of  such
      meter  in  accordance  with the notice requirements set forth in section
      27-3020 of this code.
