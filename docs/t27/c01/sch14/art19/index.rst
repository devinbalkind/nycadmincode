      Notes:
        {1} Spacers  and  ties shall be of noncombustible material. No spacers
      or ties shall be used directly behind appliance or conductor.
    
        {2} With all clearance reduction systems using a ventilated air space,
      adequate air circulation shall be provided. There shall be  at  least  2
      in.  between  the  clearance  reduction system and combustible walls and
      ceilings for clearance reduction systems using a ventilated air space.
        {3} Mineral wool batts (blanket or board) shall have a minimum density
      of 8 lb. per ft{3} and have a minimum melting point of 1500°F.
        {4} Insulation  material  used  as  part of clearance reduction system
      shall have a thermal conductivity of 1.0(BTU-In.)/(Sq ft-Hr-°F) or less.
      Insulation board shall be formed of noncombustible material.
        {5} If a single wall connector passes through a masonry wall used as a
      wall shield, there shall be at least 1/2 in.  of  open,  ventilated  air
      space between the connector and the masonry.
        {6} There  shall  be  at  least  2  in.  between the appliance and the
      protector. In no case shall the clearance between the appliance and  the
      wall surface be reduced below that allowed in the table.
        {7} Clearances in front of the loading door and/or ash removal door of
      the appliance shall not be reduced from those in Section 8-6.
        {8} All clearances and thicknesses are minimums: larger clearances and
      thicknesses  are  acceptable.  Clearances are not to be less than 12 in.
      from appliances.
        {9} To  calculate  the  minimum  allowable  clearance,  the  following
      formula  may  be  used:  C{pr} = C{un} x (1-R/100). C{pr} is the minimum
      allowable clearance. C{un} is the required clearance with no protection,
      and R is the maximum allowable reduction in clearance.
        {10} Refer to Figures 14-11 and 14-12  for  other  reduced  clearances
      using materials (a) through (h).

        (2)  Connection  to  masonry fireplace flue. A factory-built fireplace
      stove or room heater or insert may use a masonry fireplace flue when the
      following conditions are met:
        a. There is a connector which extends from the fireplace stove or room
      heater to the flue liner.
        b. The cross-sectional area of the flue is no more  than  three  times
      the  cross-sectional  area  of  the  flue  collar  of  the factory-built
      fireplace, fireplace stove or room heater.
        c. There is a  noncombustible  seal  below  the  entry  point  of  the
      connector if the appliance vents directly through the chimney wall above
      the smoke chamber.
        d. The chimney system can be inspected and cleaned.
        e.  Air  from  the  habitable  space  is not used to dilute combustion
      products in the chimney flue.
