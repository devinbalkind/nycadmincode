      the tank and shall parallel the fill pipe and terminate at the fill pipe
      terminal with an unthreaded end. Such tell-tale lines shall be  provided
      with  a  check valve set to prevent flow of surface water to the storage
      tank.
        (e) Fill pipes.
        (1) Fill pipes shall terminate outside the buildings,  with  the  fill
      pipe  terminal  located  at  or  above grade, at least two feet from any
      building opening and five feet from any subway grating at or  below  the
      level  of  the  fill  pipe terminal. No fill pipe shall be less than two
      inches in diameter, and no fill pipe for no. 6 oil shall  be  less  than
      three  inch in diameter. Where no. 6 oil is used, the fill pipe terminal
      shall be located  within  three  feet  of  the  curb,  unless  otherwise
      required  by  the department of transportation or the transit authority.
      Where there are facilities for the delivery tank truck to drive onto the
      premises, the fill terminal may be located elsewhere than at  the  curb,
      provided  that the location complies with the other requirements of this
      subchapter.
        (2) Each storage tank shall be provided with  a  separate  fill  pipe,
      except  that  where  a battery of tanks is installed containing the same
      grade of oil, a common fill and header pipe may be installed.
        (3) Where the top of the storage tank is above the fill pipe terminal,
      the fill pipe shall be connected to the top of  the  tank  and  provided
      with  a  shut-off  valve  and  swing  check valve both of which shall be
      located at the fill pipe  terminal.  However,  the  shut-off  and  check
      valves may be installed in an accessible location inside the building at
      or below the level of the fill pipe terminal.
        (4) All fill pipe terminals shall be of an approved type, and shall be
      provided  with  lugs  for  embedding in concrete. In lieu of lugs, a set
      screw or threads to fasten the terminal to the fill pipe  may  be  used.
      The  outer  flange  of  the  fill pipe terminal or the seal cap shall be
      permanently marked "fuel oil". The fill pipe terminal shall be  threaded
      or  provided  with  other  equivalent means to receive the seal cap. The
      seal cap shall be suitably slotted for receiving an opening wrench,  and
      an  oilproof gasket inserted in a groove in the fill pipe terminal shall
      be provided so as to make the seal cap leakproof. A strainer  shall  not
      be  required  but,  if  used, shall be of at least one-eighth inch mesh.
      Where a storage system for volatile flammable oil and a  storage  system
      for  fuel  oil  are to be used in the same premises, the terminal of the
      fuel oil pipe shall be provided with a left-handed thread and  the  fill
      pipe  fitting  shall  be  of a different size than that required for the
      fill pipes to the tanks containing the volatile flammable oil.
        (f) Piping from transfer pump to equipment or to storage  tanks  above
      the lowest floor.
        (1)  The  piping from a transfer pump to equipment at levels above the
      lowest floor or to storage tanks at levels above  the  lowest  floor  in
      buildings,  the  return  piping,  and  vent piping shall comply with the
      applicable provisions of subdivisions (a) and (d) of  this  section  and
      shall  be  enclosed  in  a  shaft  constructed  of four inch concrete or
      masonry having a four inch clearance from all  pipe  or  pipe  covering,
      except  that  no  such  enclosures  shall  be  required  within the room
      containing the pump, tank,  or  equipment  where  such  room  is  itself
      enclosed with construction and materials having at least a two hour fire
      resistance  rating.  Provision  shall  be  made  for expansion in piping
      without the use of expansion joints.
        (2) Where it is necessary to make horizontal  offsets  in  the  supply
      piping  and  pipe  shafts  such  piping shall be enclosed in a sleeve of
      other piping of at least no. 10 U.S.  standard  gage  steel,  two  sizes
    
      larger  and  arranged to drain into the shaft. Horizontal piping offsets
      shall be further  enclosed  in  construction  having  a  two  hour  fire
      resistance rating, except that no such enclosure or pipe sleeve shall be
      required  within  the room containing the pump, tank, or equipment where
      such room is itself enclosed with construction and materials  having  at
      lease a two hour fire resistance rating.
        (3)  A  drain  pipe shall be installed at the base of shafts enclosing
      the supply and overflow piping. The pipe shall lead  to  an  open  sight
      drain or to an open sump.
        (4)  Oil lines for equipment or tanks shall be steel pipe ASTM A-53 or
      A-106, grade B seamless, schedule 40 with welded connections up  to  the
      oil  tank  or  equipment, except that fittings at the tank or equipment,
      shut off valves and other fuel oil  flow  and  control  devices  may  be
      screwed or flanged.
        (5)  Pipe shafts shall not be penetrated by or contain other piping or
      ducts.
        (6) The piping shall be located and secured from  movement  so  as  to
      prevent  undue  stress  on  the  piping  and  to isolate the piping from
      vibrations from any equipment.
        (7) Pipe connections to the main header (supply or  return)  shall  be
      made  from  the  top  of  the  header,  except  for systems described in
      paragraph (11) of this subdivision.
        (8) Required air vents and vacuum breakers shall be designed for their
      required use.
        (9) All air vents and vacuum breakers shall be hard piped to a curb or
      pan as provided for in subdivision (b) of section 27-829.
        (10) In systems with equipment  above  the  lowest  floor  where  such
      equipment  is designed to operate utilizing fuel stored above the lowest
      floor, piping diameters shall not exceed four inches. However, where  an
      applicant  demonstrates  by  the  inclusion of calculations on the plans
      that a greater diameter is necessary to ensure the proper flow  for  the
      functioning  of  the system, such greater diameter may be permitted. All
      oil stored above the lowest floor  shall  be  in  tanks  complying  with
      subdivision (b) of section 27-829 of this code; piping shall not be used
      for fuel storage purposes.
        (11)  In  systems  with  equipment  above  the lowest floor where such
      equipment is designed to operate utilizing fuel pumped  as  needed  from
      the  lowest floor and without utilizing fuel oil stored above the lowest
      floor, piping diameters throughout such systems  shall  not  exceed  the
      design  flow  (three  times the maximum firing rate as calculated by the
      engineer  or  architect).  However,  piping   diameters   within   rooms
      containing  such  equipment  may  exceed the calculated design flow pipe
      size to provide limited reservoir storage to prime  equipment,  provided
      such  reservoir  storage  is  counted  toward  the  maximum  two hundred
      seventy-five gallons of  oil  storage  per  story  as  provided  for  in
      subdivision b of section 27-829 of this code.
        (g)  Heating  coils  in  storage  tanks. The heating of oil in storage
      tanks shall be by means of coils using low pressure hot water or  steam,
      or by means of electric heaters approved for use in oil storage tanks.
        (h) Valves and devices to control the flow of oil.
        (1)  Where  more than one storage tank is connected to a common supply
      line, a shut-off valve shall be provided in  the  supply  line  at  each
      tank.  Where  more  than  one  burner  is  connected  to a supply line a
      shut-off valve shall be provided at each burner. Where a single tank and
      a single burner are installed, a shut-off valve shall be required in the
      supply line at the tank and another at the burner. Valves shall be brass
      or equivalent in corrosion and  fire  resistance,  shall  provide  tight
    
      shut-off,  and  shall be rated at one hundred twenty-five psi or greater
      as required by the pressure in the system.
        (2)  Where  a  storage  tank is located so that the top of the tank is
      above the oil inlet to the burner or to the fuel pump, and  the  storage
      tank  capacity  is  greater  than  two hundred seventy-five gallons, the
      supply line to the burner shall be provided with an approved anti-syphon
      device. The device shall be located at the highest point in  the  supply
      line.  Where  an approved foot valve is used in the tank and the tank is
      constructed with a manhole, an anti-syphon device shall not be required.
      No anti-syphon device shall be required where no. 6 fuel oil is used.
        (3) The pressure in oil lines to  burners  located  above  the  lowest
      floor  of a building shall not be more than is required to circulate oil
      to and from the burners, and all  parts  of  the  oil  system  shall  be
      capable of withstanding the maximum working pressure in that part of the
      system.
        (4)  A remote control shall be provided to stop the flow of oil to any
      burner. Such control shall be located outside the entrance to  the  room
      in  which  the  burner  is  located  and  as  close  to such entrance as
      practicable, except that when an outside location is impracticable, such
      control may be located immediately inside the room in which  the  burner
      is  located, provided such location is accessible at all times. All such
      controls shall be permanently labeled "remote control for  oil  burner."
      On  storage  tanks  of  sixty gallon or less capacity used with manually
      operated burners, such remote control may be  installed  in  the  supply
      lines between tank and burner.
        (5)  Pressure  in  a  storage  tank for the purpose of discharging oil
      shall be prohibited.
        (6) In systems where either steam or air is  used  for  atomizing  the
      oil, the oil and the atomizing supply shall be interlocked so that where
      the  supply  of  either  is interrupted, the supply of the other will be
      immediately cut off.
        (i) Oil level indicating devices and test wells.
        (1) All tanks located inside buildings shall be provided with  an  oil
      level indicating device. Test wells shall be prohibited in tanks located
      inside of buildings. Unused tank openings shall be permanently sealed to
      prevent the removal of plugs or cover.
        (2)  Oil level indicating devices shall be designed and constructed of
      substantial materials so that there can be no  leakage  of  oil  or  oil
      vapor.
        (3)  Test wells in storage tanks located outside of buildings shall be
      capped oil tight and kept closed when not in use.
