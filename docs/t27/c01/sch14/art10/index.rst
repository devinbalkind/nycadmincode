Section 27-809 ::    
        
     
        ยง 27-809 Insulation and clearances. All accessible piping in habitable
      and   occupiable  rooms  carrying  steam,  water,  or  other  fluids  at
      temperatures exceeding one hundred sixty-five degrees  Fahrenheit  shall
      be  insulated  to  prevent  the  temperature at the outer surface of the
      insulation from exceeding sixty degrees  Fahrenheit  above  the  ambient
      temperature.  The  openings  for  insulated  piping  through combustible
      floors, walls, partitions, ceilings and other  combustible  construction
      shall   include   clearance  and  insulation  adequate  to  satisfy  the
      requirements of section 27-792 of article one of this subchapter.  Where
      accessible  piping  carries  a  fluid  not  exceeding  two hundred fifty
      degrees Fahrenheit and insulation would interfere with  the  functioning
      of  the  system,  such  piping  may  be  uninsulated provided sufficient
      clearance is maintained from the combustible construction  so  that  the
      temperature  limitation  of  section  27-792  of  article  one  of  this
      subchapter is not exceeded, and all uninsulated piping shall be provided
      with at least one-half inch clearance from combustible materials.

        ยง   27-811   Insulation   materials.   All  insulations  shall  be  of
      noncombustible materials. All coverings, vapor  barriers  and  adhesives
      shall  have a flame spread rating no higher than twenty-five and a smoke
      developed rating no higher than fifty.  Adhesives  and  mastic  finishes
      shall be tested in sufficient bulk to produce maximum burning, and shall
      be tested in accordance with reference standard RS 14-11.
