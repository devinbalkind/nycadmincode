        ยง 27-793 Boilers. (a) Acceptance tests. Boilers shall not be placed in
      operation upon completion of construction until they have been inspected
      and  tested  and  an  equipment  use  permit  has  been  issued  by  the
      commissioner. All final inspections  and  tests  for  boilers  shall  be
      subject  to  the  provisions  for  controlled  inspection as provided in
      subchapter one of this chapter, except that such inspections  and  tests
      shall  be  made  by  a  qualified  boiler inspector in the employ of the
      department or a duly authorized insurance company as provided in section
      two hundred four of the labor law. Equipment having a Btu input  of  not
      more than three hundred fifty thousand Btu per hour shall be exempt from
      this requirement.
        (b) Periodic boiler inspections.
        (1)  Except  as  provided  in  paragraph  two of this subdivision, all
      boilers, as defined in section  two  hundred  four  of  the  labor  law,
      excepting  those  boilers  listed in subdivision five of such section of
      the labor law,  shall  be  inspected  at  least  once  a  year  by  duly
      authorized  insurance  companies  or  other  qualified inspectors in the
      manner  set  forth  in  rules  and  regulations   promulgated   by   the
      commissioner. Such inspections shall also include the chimney connectors
      described  in  article  three of subchapter fifteen of this chapter. All
      boiler inspectors who perform  periodic  inspections  pursuant  to  this
      subdivision  shall  be  qualified  under section two hundred four of the
      labor law and rules and regulations promulgated by the  commissioner  of
      labor.
        (2)  Each  owner  of  a  high-pressure  boiler, as defined in sections
      26-160 and 27-795 of this code, may choose to  have  the  annual  boiler
      inspection conducted by the department or by a duly authorized insurance
      company.
        (c) Owners annual statement.
        (1)  The  owner  of each boiler that is subject to periodic inspection
      shall  file  an  annual  written  statement   with   the   commissioner,
      specifying:
        a. The location of each boiler.
        b.  Whether  or  not  the  owner,  agent, or lessee has had the boiler
      inspected by a duly authorized  insurance  company  or  other  qualified
      inspector in accordance with the requirements of subdivision (b) of this
      section,  setting forth the name and address of the insurance company or
      other qualified inspector, the date of inspection, and the policy number
      covering the boiler.
        (2) If the periodic boiler inspection has been  performed  by  a  duly
      authorized  insurance  company  or other qualified inspector pursuant to
      subdivision  (b)  of  this  section,  the  annual  statement  shall   be
      accompanied by a signed copy of the report of each boiler inspection, on
      such forms and in such manner as required by the commissioner.
        (3) The statement shall be filed within thirty days after installation
      of  a boiler. Thereafter, it shall be filed on or before the last day of
      December of the year of each annual inspection.
        (d) Removal or discontinuance notice. The owner of a  boiler  that  is
      removed  or  discontinued  from  use shall file a written notice of such
      removal or discontinuance with the commissioner within  thirty  days  of
      the date of removal or discontinuance.
        (e)  Failure  to  file statements and notices. If an owner of a boiler
      shall fail to file any statement or notice required under this  section,
      such  owner  shall  be  liable  for  a civil penalty pursuant to section

Section 27-794 ::    
        
     
        ยง 27-794 Fuel burning and fuel storage installations. (a) Field tests.
        (1)  All  liquid  fuel  piping  and  fuel  oil  storage tanks shall be
      hydrostatically tested for tightness by  the  contractor  who  made  the
      installation  before  the  work  is  closed  in and before the system is
      operated. The piping shall be tested  at  one  and  one-half  times  the
      maximum  working  pressure  applicable to that part of the piping system
      but at a pressure less than the test pressure required for  the  storage
      tank.  The  minimum pressure for testing tanks shall be one and one-half
      times the maximum working pressure applicable to the tank but in no case
      less than twenty-five psi. The hydrostatic pressure shall be  maintained
      until all joints and connections have been visually inspected for leaks,
      but  in no case for less than one-half hour. The tank shall not show any
      permanent deformation as a result of the test. A record shall be kept of
      the pressure tests showing the name of the contractor and the  pressures
      at which the piping and the tank were tested.
        (2)  Gas  distribution  piping  shall  be  tested for tightness by the
      contractor who made the installation before the work is  closed  in  and
      before  the  system  is operated, in accordance with the requirements of
      section 27-922 of article seven of subchapter sixteen of  this  chapter.
      For gas storage tanks see chapter four of this title.
        (b)   Inspections.  Fuel  burning  equipment  shall  be  inspected  in
      accordance  with  the  requirements  for   controlled   inspections   in
      subchapter  one, except that the inspections may be made by an architect
      or engineer who need not  be  in  the  employ  of  the  owner  or  by  a
      representative of the commissioner.
        (c)  Temporary  use  permit.  A  temporary  equipment  use  permit, as
      provided in subchapter one, may  be  issued  by  the  commissioner  upon
      receipt   of   a  statement  signed  by  the  contractor  who  made  the
      installation, certifying that:
        (1) The portions of the work completed conform with all provisions  of
      the code listing at the same time any items still to be completed.
        (2)  All  required  pressure tests have been successfully completed on
      the portion of the work installed and giving the pressures at which  the
      tests were made.
        (d)  Instruction cards. For oil burning systems, cards giving complete
      instructions for the care and operation of the system shall be furnished
      and shall be permanently located in an  easily  visible  and  accessible
      location near the equipment.
        (e)  Exceptions. An equipment use permit shall not be required for any
      installation for which a work permit is  not  required  as  provided  in
      section 27-189 of article eighteen of subchapter one of this chapter.
