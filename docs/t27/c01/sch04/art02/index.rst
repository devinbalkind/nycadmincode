      battery park city authority prior to September first,  nineteen  hundred
      eighty-seven, when such application was required by law or regulation to
      be  approved  by  such agency; provided, however, that such waiver would
      not significantly adversely affect provisions  for  health,  safety  and
      security  and  that  equally safe and proper alternatives are prescribed
      and, further, that such waiver is based upon  a  specific  finding  that
      strict compliance with the requirement:
        (a) would create an undue economic burden; or
        (b) would not achieve its intended objective; or
        (c) would be physically or legally impossible; or
        (d)  would  be  unnecessary  in light of alternatives which insure the
      achievement of the intended objective or which, without a  loss  in  the
      level  of  safety,  achieve  the  intended  objective  more efficiently,
      effectively or economically; or
        (e) would entail a  change  so  slight  as  to  produce  a  negligible
      additional benefit consonant with the purposes of this code.
        (2)  Each  application  for  a  waiver  under  subdivision one of this
      section shall be made to the commissioner in writing, setting forth each
      requirement sought to be waived  and  the  specific  reason  or  reasons
      therefor.   The   commissioner   shall   determine,  under  all  of  the
      circumstances presented by such application, which of such  requirements
      may   appropriately  be  waived.  The  commissioner  shall  render  such
      determination  in  a  writing  which  shall  set  forth  in  detail  the
      commissioner's findings and conclusions with respect to each requirement
      sought  to  be  waived.  A  copy  of such written determination shall be
      forwarded to the applicant. Such written determination  shall  be  filed
      with the department and shall be available for public inspection.
        (3)  The  mayor's  office  for the handicapped or its successor agency
      shall be consulted by and shall advise the commissioner concerning  each
      application for a waiver under subdivision (1) of this section.
