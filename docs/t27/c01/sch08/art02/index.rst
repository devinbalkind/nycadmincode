      feet on centers, provided such aisle  serves  only  the  rows  of  seats
      adjacent to it.
        (3)  TAPERED  AISLES.  Tapered  aisles  shall  be used where egress is
      provided only at one end of the aisle, except that uniform aisles may be
      used when their width for the entire length will accommodate eighty  per
      cent  of  the  total  occupant  load served by the aisle. Tapered aisles
      shall be widened gradually so that their width at the point of discharge
      provides for the entire occupant load of the aisle.
        (4) UNIFORM AISLES. Aisles of uniform width shall be used where egress
      is provided at both ends of an aisle by  either  cross  aisles  or  exit
      doors.  The  width of uniform aisles shall not be less than required for
      sixty per cent of the total occupant load served by the aisles.
        (5) AISLE WIDTH AT OPENINGS. When an aisle or cross  aisle  discharges
      directly  into exit openings, a space shall be provided in front of such
      openings that is at least as wide as such openings and at least as  deep
      as the width of the aisle or cross aisle.
        (6)  CROSS AISLES. Cross aisles, at any point shall not be closer than
      twelve feet to a stage area using scenery or scenic elements.  Steppings
      shall not be permitted in cross aisles.
        (7)  AISLE  GRADIENTS AND STEPPINGS. The floors of aisles shall have a
      gradient of not more than one in  eight.  Where  differences  in  levels
      require  a  greater  gradient,  steps  shall be used, complying with the
      following:
        a. When one riser only is used between levels of platforms, its height
      shall not exceed eight inches, and where more than one  riser  is  used,
      none shall exceed seven and three-quarter inches.
        b. No riser shall be less than four inches high.

        § 27-533 Travel distance. At least one exit opening shall be available
      from  every attached seat or standee space in an assembly space, or from
      the most remote point in the space when movable seats are  provided  or,
      when   no  seats  are  provided,  within  the  primary  travel  distance
      limitation listed in table 8-1. In addition, an alternate  exit  opening
      shall  be  available  from every attached seat or standee space, or from
      the most remote point when attached seats are not  provided  within  the
      secondary travel distance limitation listed in table 8-1. Such alternate
      exit  openings  may serve to satisfy the requirements for primary travel
      distance for other seats or  locations.  Exit  openings  satisfying  the
      primary  and  secondary travel distance requirements for any one seat or
      location shall be separated from each other by a distance  of  at  least
      twenty-five feet.
        (a)  Travel  distance shall be the measured distance along centerlines
      of paths of travel to the centerline of the exit opening, as adjusted by
      penalties for multi-directional or stepped travel as provided below.
        (1) No path of travel shall be permitted through rows of seating other
      than the first leg of travel from a seat to an aisle.
        (2) The first thirty-five feet of a  primary  path  of  travel  and  a
      secondary  path  of  travel may be common to each other except that this
      distance may be increased to fifty feet in F-2 places of assembly.
        (3) Not more than three  changes  in  direction  of  travel  shall  be
      permitted  in  the  path  of  travel  to  an  exit  opening. A change in
      direction shall be deemed to  occur  when  it  is  necessary  to  change
      direction  by  a  forty-five degrees or greater angle, measured from the
      preceding line of travel, except that it shall not be  considered  as  a
      change  in  direction when it is necessary in an aisle or cross aisle to
      travel in another direction not more than seven feet.
        (4) Travel distance shall be the sum of the distances of all  segments
      of travel to the exit, computed as follows:
     
                Segment                           Length
        First leg of travel                  Measured distance
        Second leg of travel after first     Measured distance
          change in direction
        Third leg of travel after second     1.25 times measured distance
          change in direction
        Fourth leg of travel after third     1.40 times measured distance
          change in direction
        Any leg of travel with four or       1.25 times length of segment as
          more steps                           computed above

      comply with the following:
        (a) Capacity. The capacity of exit openings  shall  be  listed  as  in
      table  8-1,  based  on  the  number  of  occupants  for whom the opening
      satisfies the primary travel distance requirement.
        (b) Width. Exit openings shall be at least thirty-six inches wide  for
      single   doors   and  at  least  sixty-six  inches  but  not  more  than
      eighty-eight inches wide for doors swinging in  pairs,  except  that  in
      assembly  spaces  having an occupant load of over three hundred persons,
      single door openings shall be at least forty-four inches wide.
        (c) Classification.  Exit  openings  from  assembly  spaces  shall  be
      classified as follows:
        Class  1. Exit openings that are used for normal entry to the assembly
      space, and that open directly to a safe area  or  to  an  open  exterior
      space.
        Class  2.  Exit  openings  that  are  not used for normal entry to the
      assembly space, and that open directly to a safe  area  or  to  an  open
      exterior space.
        Class  3.  Exit  openings  that  open  from  the  assembly  space into
      corridors, exit passageways, or vertical exits.
        (d) Distribution of classes.  The  required  exit  capacity  from  F-2
      places  of assembly, and from all other assembly spaces in which the net
      floor area, exclusive of stage area, is twelve square feet or  more  per
      person  may be provided by exit openings of any class. The required exit
      capacity from assembly spaces in which the net floor area, exclusive  of
      stage  area,  is  less  than  twelve  square  feet  per  person shall be
      distributed so that exit openings of each class are provided  to  comply
      with the following requirements:
        1.  For assembly spaces in which the mean floor level is not more than
      fifteen feet above or below the  adjoining  grade  elevation,  the  exit
      capacity  shall  be distributed as follows: Class 1--not less than forty
      per cent
        Class 2--not more than sixty per cent
        Class 3--not more than forty per cent
        2. For assembly spaces in which the mean  floor  level  is  more  than
      fifteen  feet,  but  not  more  than  thirty  feet,  above  or below the
      adjoining grade elevation, the exit capacity  shall  be  distributed  as
      follows:
        Class 1--not less than sixty per cent
        Class 3--not more than forty per cent
        3.  For  assembly  spaces  in  which the mean floor level is more than
      thirty feet above or below  the  adjoining  grade  elevation,  the  exit
      capacity shall be distributed as follows:
        Class 1--not less than one hundred per cent
        (e)  Location. No exit opening shall be closer than twelve feet to any
      part of a stage using scenery or  scenic  elements.  All  exit  openings
      shall  be  clearly  identifiable and shall not be disguised as part of a
      wall or covered in any way to obscure them from view. Where, because  of
      the configuration of the assembly space enclosure an exit opening is not
      visible  from  all seats using it as a means of egress, directional exit
      signs shall be placed on the enclosure alongside  the  exit  opening  to
      indicate  its  location.  These  signs  shall  be  in  addition to those
      required over the exit opening.
        (f) Locking. No exit door shall be locked so as to prevent egress from
      an assembly space while it is occupied.

        § 27-535 Safe areas. Safe areas shall comply with the following:
        When provided to serve class one or class two exit openings safe areas
      shall  be  separated from assembly spaces by noncombustible construction
      having a two hour fire-resistance rating, and shall serve as  transition
      areas  in  the  line  and direction of exit travel. They shall serve for
      normal entry to the  assembly  space  and  may  be  used  as  corridors,
      lobbies,  or  lounges. No room or space classified in occupancy group A,
      B-1, D-1, or D-2 shall open upon a safe area. Safe areas shall be  at  a
      level not more than six feet above or below the level at which egress is
      made from the assembly space, except that a separate safe area shall not
      be  required for any assembly space having an occupant load of less than
      one hundred fifty persons and which is served by a safe area of  another
      assembly  space,  when  such  safe  area  is in the direction of egress.
      Ventilating systems for safe areas shall not  be  connected  to  systems
      serving  any  other  spaces,  unless separated from such systems by fire
      dampers  actuated  by   smoke   detectors   meeting   the   construction
      requirements of subchapter thirteen of this chapter.

      areas shall be located within six feet above or below the assembly space
      nearest to grade.
        (2) OCCUPANT LOAD. The occupant load of  a  safe  area  shall  be  the
      aggregate  occupant  load of all exit openings discharging directly into
      it. The occupant load of a collecting safe area shall be  the  aggregate
      occupant  load  of  all exit openings discharging directly into it, plus
      fifty per cent of the occupant load of other safe areas discharging into
      it.
        (3) DIMENSIONS.  Except  as  provided  in  subdivision  four  of  this
      section,  the  clear  unobstructed floor area of each safe area shall be
      sufficient to accommodate the total occupant load of the  safe  area  on
      the basis of two square feet per person, not including space occupied by
      furniture or equipment. The minimum dimension of such unobstructed space
      shall  be  eight  feet.  The  width  of  the unobstructed space shall be
      measured at right angles to the direction of travel to an exit and shall
      not be less than required for the occupant load, on  the  basis  of  the
      exit  capacity listed in table 8-1. The height of safe areas shall be at
      least eight feet at all points.
        (4) SAFE AREAS NEAR GRADE. When a safe area provides egress to an open

      need  not  provide  the floor area required by subdivision three of this
      section when the level of discharge from  the  safe  area  to  the  open
      exterior  space  is  not more than four feet above or below the grade of
      the open exterior space.
        (5) RAMPS AND STEPS. Ramps in safe areas shall have a gradient of  not
      more  than  one  in  twelve,  except that when not exceeding six feet in
      length, the gradient may be not greater than one in ten. Steps  in  safe
      areas shall comply with the following requirements:
        a.  No  riser  shall  be  less than six inches nor more than seven and
      one-half inches high.
        b. No riser shall vary in height from the riser immediately  above  or
      below it.
        c.  Treads  in  flights  of  steps  shall be at least ten and one-half
      inches wide exclusive of nosing, and, except as provided in paragraph  d

      shall be at least twenty-four inches but not more than  twenty-five  and
      one-half inches.
    
        d.  No change in levels shall have less than three risers, except that
      where  the  intervening  tread  is  between  twenty-eight   inches   and
      thirty-six inches, two risers may be used when the edge of each tread is
      marked by a contrasting color stripe.
        e.  Where  exit openings from an assembly space are above or below the
      level of the safe area, a platform shall be provided at the  same  level
      as  that  of  the  exit opening. The platform shall be at least one foot
      wider on each side than the exit opening, and shall extend a minimum  of
      six  feet  in the direction of exit travel. The sides of such platforms,
      and of steps or ramps leading from them, shall be protected by guards at
      least three feet high.
        (6) EXITS FROM SAFE AREAS. The capacity of exits from safe areas shall
      be as listed in table 8-1. Exit openings from safe areas shall discharge
      into exit types as provided in subchapter six of this chapter.
