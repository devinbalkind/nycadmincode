Article 4 - LIVE LOAD REDUCTION
===============================

Section 27-565
--------------

Section 27-565 ::    
        
     
        ยง 27-565 Roof loads. No reduction shall be permitted.
    
    
    
    
    
    
    

Section 27-566
--------------

Section 27-566 ::    
        
     
        ยง 27-566 Floor live loads. The uniform live load to be used for design
      shall  be  the  basic  value  established  in  reference standard RS 9-2
      multiplied by the percentages given in subdivisions (a) through  (d)  of
      this section.
        (a)  Except  as  provided  in  subdivisions  (b),  (c),  and  (d), the
      percentages in table  9-1  shall  apply.  Contributory  areas  shall  be
      computed in accordance with section 27-567 of this article.
        (b)  No  live  load  reduction  shall  be permitted for the following:
      members  and  connections  (other  than  columns,  piers,   and   walls)
      supporting  floor  areas used for storage (including warehouses, library
      stacks, and record storage); areas used for  parking  of  vehicles;  and
      areas  used  as  place of assembly, for manufacturing, and for retail or
      wholesale sales. For columns, piers, and  walls  supporting  such  floor
      areas the maximum live load reduction shall be twenty per cent.
        (c)  No  live  load reduction shall be permitted for calculating shear
      stresses at the heads of column in flat slab or flat plate construction.
        (d) In lieu of the percentages given  in  table  9-1,  the  live  load
      reductions for columns, piers and walls may be taken as fifteen per cent
      of the live load on the top floor, increased successively at the rate of
      five  per  cent on each successive lower floor, with a maximum reduction
      of fifty per cent; and for girders supporting two hundred square feet or
      more of floor area, the live load reduction may be taken as fifteen  per
      cent.  The  limitations of subdivisions (b), (c) and (d) of this section
      shall apply.

      Note:
        * For intermediate values  of  live  load/dead  load,  the  applicable
      percentages of live load may be interpolated.
    
    
    
    
    
    
    

Section 27-567

Section 27-567 ::    
        
     
        ยง 27-567 Contributory floor areas. For purposes of computing live load
      reduction, contributory floor areas shall be determined as follows:
        (a)  For  the  design of one-way and two-way slabs: the product of the
      shorter span length and a width  equal  to  one-half  the  shorter  span
      length. Ribbed slabs shall be considered as though the slabs were solid.
        (b)  For  the design of slabs in flat plate or flat slab construction:
      one-half the area of the panel.
        (c) For the design of columns and  girders  or  trusses  framing  into
      columns:  the  loaded  area directly supported by the column, girder, or
      truss. For columns supporting more than one floor, the loaded area shall
      be the cumulative total area of all the floors that are supported.
        (d) For the design of joists and similar multiple members framing into
      girders or trusses, or minor framing around openings: twice  the  loaded
      area directly supported but not more than the area of the panel in which
      the framing occurs.
    
    
    
    
    
    
    

Section 27-568
--------------

Section 27-568 ::    
        
     
        ยง  27-568  Foundations  and  column  supports.  The  live  load  to be
      supported by the foundation  or  by  trusses  or  girders  that  support
      columns  shall  be  the  total  column  reaction  reduced as provided in
      section 27-566 and section 27-567 of this article.
