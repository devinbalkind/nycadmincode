        ยง  27-571  Bins  and  bunkers.  Loads  on  component parts of bins and
      bunkers  may  be  reduced  for  friction  on  sidewalls,  provided  that
      sidewalls  and  supports  are  proportioned  for  the increased vertical
      loads. Where stresses would be increased in any component by arching  of
      the fill, the effect of such arching shall be considered.
