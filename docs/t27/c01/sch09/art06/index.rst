Article 6 - OTHER LOADS
=======================

Section 27-570
--------------

Section 27-570 ::    
        
     
        §  27-570  Earth  pressures  and  foundation  loads. The provisions of
      article three of subchapter eleven of this chapter shall apply.
    
    
    
    
    
    
    

Section 27-571
--------------

Section 27-571 ::    
        
     
        §  27-571  Bins  and  bunkers.  Loads  on  component parts of bins and
      bunkers  may  be  reduced  for  friction  on  sidewalls,  provided  that
      sidewalls  and  supports  are  proportioned  for  the increased vertical
      loads. Where stresses would be increased in any component by arching  of
      the fill, the effect of such arching shall be considered.
    
    
    
    
    
    
    

Section 27-572
--------------

Section 27-572 ::    
        
     
        §  27-572 Prestressing forces. Prestressing forces shall be considered
      in the design of  prestressed  concrete  structures,  cable  structures,
      guyed structures, and multiple intersecting truss webs utilizing tension
      members.
    
    
    
    
    
    
    

Section 27-573
--------------

Section 27-573 ::    
        
     
        §  27-573 Construction loads. The provisions of subchapter nineteen of
      this chapter shall apply.
    
    
    
    
    
    
    

Section 27-574
--------------

Section 27-574 ::    
        
     
        §  27-574  Fluid  pressures.  The  design of building components shall
      consider pressures, both positive and negative, of confined  fluids  and
      gases.
    
    
    
    
    
    
    

Section 27-575
--------------

Section 27-575 ::    
        
     
        § 27-575 Ice. The weight of a one-half inch radial thickness of ice on
      all  surfaces shall be considered as part of the live load in the design
      of open framed or guyed towers.
    
    
    
    
    
    
    

Section 27-576
--------------

Section 27-576 ::    
        
     
        §  27-576  Thermal  forces. The design of enclosed buildings more than
      two hundred fifty feet in plan dimension shall provide  for  the  forces
      and/or  movements resulting from an assumed expansion corresponding to a
      change in temperature of forty degrees F. For exterior  exposed  frames,
      arches,  or  shells  regardless  of  plan  dimensions,  the design shall
      provide for the  forces  and/or  movements  resulting  from  an  assumed
      expansion  and  contraction  corresponding to an increase or decrease in
      temperature of forty degrees F for concrete or masonry construction  and
      sixty  degrees  F  for  metal  construction.  For  determining  required
      anchorage for piping, the forces shall be determined  on  the  basis  of
      temperature  variations  for  the  specific service conditions. Friction
      forces in expansion bearings shall be considered.
    
    
    
    
    
    
    

Section 27-577
--------------

Section 27-577 ::    
        
     
        § 27-577 Shrinkage. The design of reinforced concrete components shall
      provide  for the forces and/or movements resulting from shrinkage of the
      concrete in the amount of 0.0002 times the  length  between  contraction
      joints for standard weight concrete, and 0.0003 times the length between
      contraction  joints  for  lightweight concrete. The design of arches and
      similar  structures  shall  provide  for  effects  of  shrinkage,   plus
      rib-shortening, plus plastic flow.
