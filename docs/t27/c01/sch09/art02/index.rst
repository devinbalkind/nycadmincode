Article 2 - DEAD LOADS
======================

Section 27-553
--------------

Section 27-553 ::    
        
     
        ยง   27-553   Construction   materials   and   assembled   elements  of
      construction.  Except as provided in section 27-555 of this article, the
      dead load shall be the  actual  weight  of  the  building  materials  or
      construction  assemblies to be supported, computed from the unit weights
      given  in  reference  standard  RS  9-1.  Where  unit  weights  are  not
      established  in  reference  standard  RS  9-1, the actual weights may be
      determined by analysis  or  from  data  in  manufacturers'  drawings  or
      catalogs.  Unit  weights  less than those given in reference standard RS
      9-1 may be used only with approval of the commissioner.
    
    
    
    
    
    
    

Section 27-554
--------------

Section 27-554 ::    
        
     
        ยง 27-554 Service equipment. Provision shall be made for the weights of
      all  building  service  equipment  including  plumbing  stacks,  piping,
      heating and air conditioning equipment, electrical equipment, elevators,
      elevator machinery, flues, and similar fixed equipment. The  weights  of
      such  equipment  (or  the  allowances therefor) shall be included in the
      dead load. The weight of equipment that is part of the  occupancy  of  a
      given  area  shall be considered as live load. See also paragraph two of
      subdivision (b) and subdivision (d) of section 27-557 of  article  three
      of this subchapter.
    
    
    
    
    
    
    

Section 27-555
--------------

Section 27-555 ::    
        
     
        ยง   27-555  Partition  loads.  Weights  of  all  partitions  shall  be
      considered, using either actual weights at locations shown on the  plans
      or the equivalent uniform load given in subdivision (b) of this section.
        (a) Actual loads. Where actual partition weights are used, the uniform
      design  live load may be omitted from the strip of floor area under each
      partition.
        (b) Equivalent uniform load. The equivalent uniform partition loads in
      reference standard RS 9-1 may  be  used  in  lieu  of  actual  partition
      weights except for bearing partitions or partitions in toilet room areas
      (other  than in one- and two-family dwellings), at stairs and elevators,
      and similar areas where partitions  are  concentrated.  In  such  cases,
      actual  partition  weights  shall be used in design. Except as otherwise
      exempted,  equivalent  uniform  loads  shall  be  used  in  areas  where
      partitions  are  not  definitely located on the plans, or in areas where
      partitions are subject to rearrangement or location.
