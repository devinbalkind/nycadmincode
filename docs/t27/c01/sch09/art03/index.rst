Section 27-556
--------------

Section 27-556 ::    
        
     
        §  27-556 General. In addition to the applicable dead, wind, and other
      loads, the building shall  be  designed  for  uniform  live  loads,  for
      concentrated  live  loads, or for concurrent combinations of uniform and
      concentrated live loads, whichever produce the greatest stress.
    
    
    
    
    
    
    

Section 27-557
--------------

Section 27-557 ::    
        
     
        §  27-557  Floor live loads. (a) Uniformly distributed live loads. The
      minimum design values established  in  reference  standard  RS  9-2  for
      various  occupancies  or uses shall be used subject to the provisions of
      subdivision (d) of this section. Where the occupancy or use of  a  space
      does  not  conform  to  any  of  those  listed, the design load shall be
      determined by the architect or  engineer  subject  to  approval  by  the
      commissioner.
        (b) Concentrated live loads.
        (1)   The   building  framing  shall  be  capable  of  supporting  the
      concentrated live loads established in reference standard RS 9-2, placed
      so as to produce maximum stress.
        (2)  Floors  that  support  any  items  of  machinery,  electrical  or
      mechanical  equipment,  or other concentrated live load in excess of one
      thousand pounds (including the  weights  of  pads  or  bases)  shall  be
      designed  to  support  such  weight  as  a concentrated load or group of
      concentrated loads.
        (c) Nonconcurrence.
        (1)  When  a  concentrated  live  load  is  present,   the   uniformly
      distributed load may be considered to be omitted in the area occupied by
      the concentrated load.
        (2)  Where  reference  standard RS 9-2 indicates that the concentrated
      live load is nonconcurrent with the uniform live load, it may be assumed
      that the total concentrated load is to be omitted when the uniform  load
      is  present  and  that  the total uniform load is to be omitted when the
      concentrated load is present.
        (d) Conformance. For purposes of determining that the magnitude of the
      actual live load conforms to or is less than  the  minimum  design  live
      load  established in this section, the actual uniform live load shall be
      approximated by  averaging  the  total  load  actually  applied  over  a
      rectangular  area  of  one hundred fifty square feet having no side less
      than eight feet.

Section 27-558 ::    
        
     
        §  27-558  Live  loads  for  sidewalks,  driveways,  and railings. (a)
      Sidewalks and driveways.
        (1) When supported on grade,  all  sidewalks  for  new  buildings  and
      alterations  shall  be  subject  to  inspection  and  acceptance  by the
      commissioner. Portions of such sidewalks that are  located  between  the
      curb  line  and  the street line shall be constructed in compliance with
      the  specifications  for  concrete  sidewalks  of  the   department   of
      transportation.
        (2)   All  sidewalks  and  driveways  or  portions  thereof  that  are
      structurally supported shall be designed for a live load of one  hundred
      psf  uniformly  distributed  and  in  accordance  with the provisions of
      subchapter ten of  this  chapter.  Where  subject  to  intentionally  or
      accidentally imposed wheel loads of vehicles, such portions of sidewalks
      and  driveways shall be designed for a uniformly distributed load of six
      hundred psf or for the  maximum  vehicular  wheel  load  that  could  be
      imposed thereon, whichever develops the greater stresses.
        (3)  Appurtenant  components  of  sidewalks  and  driveways, including
      manholes,  manhole  covers,  vault  covers,  gratings,  etc.,  shall  be
      designed  for the loads prescribed in paragraph two of this subdivision,
      or  shall  conform  to  the  standards  of  the   city   agency   having
      jurisdiction.
        (b) Railings and parapets.
        (1)  Railings and parapets around stairwells, balconies, areaways, and
      roofs, and other railings in similar  locations  other  than  those  for
      places  of  assembly,  shall  be  designed  to  resist  the simultaneous
      application of a lateral force of forty plf and a vertical load of fifty
      plf, both applied to the top of the railing. For railings  and  parapets
      at  the front of theater balconies and in similar locations in places of
      assembly, the lateral force shall be increased  to  fifty  plf  and  the
      vertical  load  to one hundred plf. An exception is made for railings in
      one- and two-family dwellings, which shall be  designed  for  a  lateral
      force  of twenty plf plus a vertical load of twenty plf, both applied at
      the top of the railing. The total lateral force and total vertical  load
      shall be at least two hundred pounds each.
        (2)  Intermediate and bottom rails, if provided, shall be designed for
      the simultaneous application of forty plf applied horizontally and fifty
      plf applied vertically; however, lateral and vertical  design  loads  on
      intermediate  and  bottom  rails need not be considered in the design of
      posts and anchorages. For railings having solid panels, the panels shall
      be designed for a uniform lateral load of twenty psf.
        (3) Where railings or parapets support fixtures,  allowance  shall  be
      made for the additional loads imposed thereby.
        (4)  Railings,  bumpers,  or  similar devices used in parking areas to
      resist the impact of moving vehicles  shall  be  designed  to  resist  a
      lateral  load  of  three  hundred plf applied at least twenty-one inches
      above the  roadway;  but  in  no  case  shall  the  load  be  less  than
      twenty-five hundred pounds per vehicle.
    
    
    
    
    
    
    

Section 27-559
--------------

Section 27-559 ::    
        
     
        § 27-559 Columns in parking areas. Unless specially protected, columns
      in  parking areas subject to impact of moving vehicles shall be designed
      to resist the lateral  load  due  to  impact  and  this  load  shall  be
      considered a load of infrequent occurrence. For passenger vehicles, this
      lateral  load  shall be taken as a minimum of twenty-five hundred pounds
      applied  at  least  twenty-one  inches  above  the  roadway  and  acting
      simultaneously with other design loads.
    
    
    
    
    
    
    

Section 27-560
--------------

Section 27-560 ::    
        
     
        § 27-560 Stage areas using scenery or scenic elements. Scenery battens
      and suspension systems shall be designed for a load of thirty pounds per
      linear  foot  of batten length. Loft block and head block beams shall be
      designed to support vertical and horizontal  loads  corresponding  to  a
      four  inch  spacing  of  battens  for  the entire depth of the gridiron.
      Direction and magnitude of total forces shall  be  determined  from  the
      geometry  of  the rigging system including load concentrations from spot
      line rigging. Locking rails shall be designed for a  uniform  uplift  of
      five  hundred psf with a one thousand pound concentration. Impact factor
      for batten design shall be seventy-five per cent and for loft  and  head
      block  beams  shall be twenty-five per cent. A plan drawn to a scale not
      less than one-quarter inch equals one foot shall  be  displayed  in  the
      stage  area  indicating  the  framing  plan  of the rigging loft and the
      design loads for  all  members  used  to  support  scenery  or  rigging.
      Gridirons   over  stages  shall  be  designed  to  support  a  uniformly
      distributed live load of fifty psf in  addition  to  the  rigging  loads
      indicated.
    
    
    
    
    
    
    

Section 27-561
--------------

Section 27-561 ::    
        
     
        §  27-561  Roof  loads. Roofs and marquees shall be designed for wind,
      live, and other loads as prescribed in subdivisions (a) through  (d)  of
      this  section. It may be assumed that maximum wind load occurs with zero
      live load and that maximum live load occurs with  zero  wind  load.  For
      dwellings  an exception is made for awnings, canopies, and patio covers,
      which may be designed for a  live  load  of  twenty  psf  of  horizontal
      projection.
        (a) Live load. Minimum design live loads shall be as follows:
        (1)  For roofs with slopes up to and including twenty degrees from the
      horizontal, thirty psf of horizontal projection.
        (2) For roofs  with  slopes  greater  than  twenty  degrees  from  the
      horizontal,  thirty psf of horizontal projection, reduced by one psf for
      each degree of slope in excess of twenty degrees.
        (3) For valleys, live loadings  shall  be  increased  to  provide  for
      accumulations  of  snow.  The loading intensity shall be assumed to vary
      from forty-five psf at the low point to fifteen psf at the ridge.
        (4) For roofs having curved or pyramidal  shapes,  the  proposed  live
      load  shall  be  established  by  the  architect or engineer, subject to
      approval by the commissioner.
        (b) Wind load. The provisions of section 27-569  of  article  five  of
      this subchapter shall apply.
        (c)  Concentrated  loads. The provisions of subdivision (b) of section
      27-557 of this article shall apply.
        (d) Special loads.
        (1) When used for purposes such as promenades, assembly areas, or roof
      gardens, design shall be  made  for  live  loads  corresponding  to  the
      particular  usage, as indicated in reference standard RS 9-2. Such loads
      shall be considered as nonconcurrent with the wind load or with the live
      load specified in subdivision (a) of this section. The design  live  and
      wind  loads  for roofs, as specified elsewhere in this subchapter, shall
      be deemed to provide for incidental use of the roof of a building by the
      occupants thereof.
        (2) Where roofs are intended for the ponding of water, the roof  shall
      be  designed for the maximum possible depth of water which may be ponded
      thereon as determined by the relative levels of roof deck  and  overflow
      weirs  or  scuppers.  Such  load  need  not  be  considered as occurring
      simultaneously with wind or live load.
        (3) Girders and roof trusses (other than  joists)  over  garage  areas
      regularly  utilized  for  the  repair of vehicles and over manufacturing
      floors or storage floors used for commercical purposes shall be  capable
      of  supporting,  in  addition  to  the  specified live and wind loads, a
      concentrated live load of two thousand pounds applied at any lower chord
      panel point for trusses, and at  any  point  of  the  lower  flange  for
      girders.
        (4)  Where  roofs  are landscaped, the uniform design live load on the
      landscaped portions shall be thirty psf. The weight of  the  landscaping
      materials  shall be considered as dead load and shall be computed on the
      basis of saturation of the earth. The areas adjacant to  the  landscaped
      portions   shall  be  considered  as  assembly  areas,  unless  specific
      provision is made to prevent such use.
        (5) Where equipment is placed on roofs, the design shall  provide  for
      the support of such equipment.
    
    
    
    
    
    
    

Section 27-562
--------------

Section 27-562 ::    
        
     
        § 27-562 Moving loads. Where applicable to the use or occupancy of the
      building, the design shall consider the moving loads described below.
        (a)  General.  The  loads  established  in subdivisions (a) and (b) of
      section 27-557 of this article shall be assumed to include allowance for
      ordinary impact conditions.
        (b) Passenger vehicles. Areas used for,  and  restricted  by  physical
      limitations  of  clearance  to,  the  transit  or  parking  of passenger
      vehicles  shall  be  designed  for   the   uniformly   distributed   and
      concentrated  loads  for  parking areas for such vehicles as provided in
      reference standard RS 9-2, applied without impact. An exception is  made
      for  members  or  constructions  which, because of physical limitations,
      cannot be subjected to direct load from the vehicle or from  a  jack  or
      hoist   used   to   raise  or  suspend  the  vehicle.  Such  members  or
      constructions shall be designed  for  the  loads  corresponding  to  the
      actual usage.
        (c)  Truck  loads.  Minimum  loads  (including  vertical, lateral, and
      longitudinal) and the distribution thereof  shall  meet  the  applicable
      requirements  of  reference standard RS 9-3, except that impact shall be
      taken as ten per cent of the vertical reaction.
        (d) Railroad equipment. Minimum loads  (including  vertical,  lateral,
      longitudinal,  and  impact)  and the distribution thereof shall meet the
      applicable requirements of reference standard RS 9-4.
        (e) Crane runways and supports.
        (1) VERTICAL LOADS. Actual maximum  wheel  loads  occurring  when  the
      crane  is  lifting its capacity load shall be used. To allow for impact,
      the lifted load shall be increased twenty-five per  cent  or  the  wheel
      loads  increased  fifteen  per  cent  whichever  produces greater stress
      condition.
        (2) HORIZONTAL LOADS.
        a. Lateral load (due to crane trolley travel) shall be twenty per cent
      of the sum of the capacity load and the trolley weight, applied one-half
      at the top of each rail and acting in either  direction  normal  to  the
      runway rail.
        b. Longitudinal load (due to crane travel) shall be twenty per cent of
      the  maximum  total  reaction  (not  including impact) on the rail being
      considered, applied at the top of the rail and acting  parallel  to  the
      runway.
        (f) Monorail beams and supports.
        (1)  Vertical  loads shall be the sum of the capacity load and trolley
      weight. To allow for impact, the lifted load shall be increased ten  per
      cent  for  hand-operated  and twenty-five per cent electrically-operated
      trolleys.
        (2) Longitudinal loads shall be twenty per cent  of  the  sum  of  the
      capacity load and the weight of the trolley.
        (3)  Lateral  load shall be twenty per cent of the sum of the capacity
      load and the weight of the trolley.
        (4) Centrifugal forces shall be considered for curved tracks.
        (g) Loads on supports for elevators, dumbwaiters, and escalators.  The
      provisions of subchapter eighteen of this chapter shall apply.
        (h) Loads on machinery supports. Unless machinery is isolated from the
      support  framing,  the  reactions  of reciprocating or heavy powerdriven
      units shall be increased at least fifty per cent and reactions of  light
      shaft- or motor driven units shall be increased at least twenty-five per
      cent to provide for impact.
        (i)  Assembly  structures. Seating areas in grandstands, stadiums, and
      similar assembly structures shall be designed to resist the simultaneous
      application of a horizontal swaying load of at least twenty-four plf  of
      seats applied in a direction parallel to the row of the seats, and of at
    
      least  ten  plf  of seats in a direction perpendicular to the row of the
      seats. When this load is used  in  combination  with  wind  for  outdoor
      structures, the wind load shall be one-half of the design wind load, and
      the  provisions of subchapter ten of this chapter relating to infrequent
      stress conditions shall apply to this loading condition.
        (j) Heliports and helistops.
        (1) CONCENTRATED LOADS.
        a. Landing area. Helicopter landing areas shall be designed for either
      of the following vertical loads acting at any location:
        1. A single concentrated load equal to three  quarters  of  the  gross
      weight of the helicopter and acting on an area of one square foot.
        2.  Concentrated  loads  representing the gross wheel reactions of the
      helicopter acting simultaneously and increased one-third for impact.
        b. Taxiing  area  Helicopter  taxiing  areas  shall  be  designed  for
      concentrated loads in accordance with clause two of this subparagraph.
        (2)  UNIFORM LIVE LOAD. The landing and taxiing areas shall be capable
      of supporting a uniformly distributed live  load  of  forty  psf  acting
      nonconcurrently with the concentrated loads.
    
    
    
    
    
    
    

Section 27-563
--------------

Section 27-563 ::    
        
     
        §  27-563 Partial loading conditions. (a) Uniformly distributed loads.
      In continuous framing and  cantilever  construction,  the  design  shall
      consider  live  load  on all spans and arrangements of partial live load
      that will produce  maximum  stresses  in  the  supporting  members.  The
      simplifications   given   in   paragraphs  one  through  three  of  this
      subdivision are permissible.
        (1) FLOOR AND ROOF FRAMING.
        a. For vertical live load applied to the  level  under  consideration,
      the far ends of the columns above and below that level may be assured as
      fixed.
        b. Combinations of live load may be limited to the following:
        1. Live load placed on two adjacent spans.
        2.  Live  load  placed on alternate spans. The effects of live load on
      spans more than two spans away from the span under consideration may  be
      neglected.
        (2) ARCHES AND GABLED FRAMES.
        a. Live load placed on 1/2 span adjacent to one support.
        b. Live load placed on the center 1/4 span.
        c. Live load placed on 3/8 the span adjacent to each support.
        (3)  COLUMNS. Moments due to vertical loads may be calculated from the
      live load on the  largest  single  adjacent  span  of  the  floor  under
      consideration.  This  moment  shall  be assumed to act concurrently with
      live load on all other floors.
        (b) Moving concentrated loads. Structural  members  supporting  moving
      concentrated  loads  shall  be  designed  for  only those loads that can
      physically occur simultaneously and  are  arranged  to  produce  maximum
      stresses.

      requirements shall conform to the  requirements  of  section  27-225  of
      article twenty-three of subchapter one of this chapter.
        (b) Data required. The following floor load data shall be shown:
        (1)  The uniformly distributed design live load for each floor or part
      thereof.
        (2) The weight of any piece of machinery or  equipment  weighing  more
      than one thousand pounds, and its identifying description and location.
        (3)  The  maximum  design  wheel  load and total maximum weight of any
      vehicle that may be brought into the building.
        (4) The equivalent uniform partition loads or,  in  lieu  of  this,  a
      statement  to  the  effect  that  the  design  was  predicated on actual
      partition loads.
