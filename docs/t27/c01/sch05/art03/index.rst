Section 27-324 ::    
        
     
        §  27-324 Protection of structural members. Columns, girders, trusses,
      beams, lintels, etc. that are required to be fire  protected,  and  that
      support  only  one  floor  or a roof, and/or a non-bearing wall not more
      than one story high, shall be individually encased  on  all  sides  with
      materials  having  the  required  fire-resistance  rating;  or  shall be
      protected by a ceiling as specified in section 27-327  of  this  article
      having  the  required fire-resistance rating; or shall be protected by a
      combination of both a ceiling and individual encasement which, together,
      provide the required fire-resistance rating. Columns, girders,  trusses,
      beams,  lintels,  etc.  that are required to be fire protected, and that
      support more than one floor or support a bearing wall or wall more  than
      one  story  high,  shall  be individually encased on all sides for their
      entire  length  or   height   with   materials   having   the   required
      fire-resistance  rating.  Trusses  that  support only two stories or one
      story and a roof may be fire protected by an envelope  that  encompasses
      the entire truss with materials of the required fire-resistance rating.
        (a) Embedments and enclosures. Pipes, wires, conduits, ducts, or other
      service facilities shall not be embedded in the required fire protection
      of  a  structural  member  that  is required to be individually encased;
      except that pipes, wires, and conduits may be  installed  in  the  space
      between   the   required  fire  protection  and  the  structural  member
      protected, provided that where such facilities pierce the required  fire
      protection,  the area of the penetrations does not exceed two percent of
      the area of the fire protection on any one face,  the  penetrations  are
      closed  off  with  close-fitting  metal  escutcheons  or  plates and the
      concealed space shall be firestopped at each story  in  accordance  with
      the provisions of section 27-345 of article five of this subchapter.
        (b)  Impact  protection.  Where  the  fire  protective  covering  of a
      structural member is subject to impact damage from moving vehicles,  the
      handling of merchandise, or other activity, the fire protective covering
      shall  be protected by corner guards or by a substantial jacket of metal
      or other noncombustible material, to a height adequate to  provide  full
      protection.  Where  applicable,  such  protection  shall  be designed in
      accordance with the requirements of section 27-558 of article  three  of
      subchapter nine of this chapter.
        (c) Structural members in cavity walls. Where structural members occur
      within exterior cavity walls, portions of such structural members facing
      the  exterior need not be individually fire protected if the outer width
      of the cavity wall provides the required fire-resistance rating  and  is
      located  not  more  than  two  and  one-half inches from such structural
      members, and  if  all  surfaces  of  the  structural  members  are  fire
      protected  from  the  interior  of  the building by materials having the
      required fire-resistance rating.
        (d) Prestressing steel. Minimum covering of prestressing  steel  shall
      comply with the requirements of reference standard RS 5-15.
        (e) Exterior Exposed Structural Members. Structural members exposed to
      the  outdoors on buildings that do not exceed two stories or thirty feet
      in height, which are required by table 3-4  to  have  a  fire-resistance
      rating  not exceeding one hour, need not be protected on any face of the
      member that has an exterior separation of thirty feet or more,  provided
      the  outdoor area within the thirty feet separation distance is not used
      for storage of materials, or for motor vehicle parking.
        (f) Inspection of fire protection. The installation  of  all  required
      sprayed-on fire protection of structural members except those encased in
      concrete  shall  be subject to the controlled inspection requirements of
      section 27-132 of article seven of subchapter one of this code.
        (g)  Inspection  of  existing  sprayed-on   fire   protection   during
      alterations  in office spaces and in occupancy group E spaces. In office
    
      spaces and spaces classified in occupancy group E, where  an  alteration
      exposes  any  required sprayed-on fire protection of structural members,
      or where, pursuant to an alteration persons are  required  to  enter  or
      access  areas  in  which  such  sprayed-on fire protection is capable of
      being observed, the existing required spray-on fire protection shall  be
      subject  to  the controlled inspection requirements of section 27-132 of
      this code. Such controlled inspection shall require a determination  (i)
      that  the  existing  sprayed-on fire protection as originally applied or
      installed complies  with  the  applicable  requirements  of  this  code,
      including  those  for  installation  methods,  materials,  thickness and
      coverage; and (ii) that, since its original application,  the  integrity
      of  the  existing  sprayed-on  fire protection has not been compromised,
      damaged  or  displaced  by  the  current  alteration  or  by  any  prior
      alteration or other event.

Section 27-326 ::    
        
     
        §  27-326  Lintels.  Lintels  over  openings  wider  than four feet in
      masonry walls, other than in walls  of  masonry  veneer  on  wood  frame
      structures,  shall  be  fire  protected as required by section 27-324 of
      this article for structural members, when the full load over the opening
      is not relieved by a masonry arch of required strength. The  members  of
      an  assembled  metal lintel that support only outer face masonry that is
      securely bonded or anchored to  backing  need  not  be  fire  protected,
      provided  that  the  inner members of the assembly support the full load
      imposed  upon  the  lintel  and  are  fire  protected  as  required  for
      structural members supporting masonry.
        (a)  Stone  Lintels.  The use of stone lintels on spans exceeding four
      feet shall not  be  permitted  unless  supplemented  by  fire  protected
      structural members or masonry arches of the required strength to support
      the superimposed loads.
    
    
    
    
    
    
    

Section 27-327
--------------

Section 27-327 ::    
        
     
        §  27-327  Ceilings.  (a)  Ceilings  that  contribute  to the required
      fire-resistance rating of a floor or roof assembly shall  be  continuous
      between  exterior  walls,  vertical  fire  divisions,  fire separations,
      corridor partitions or any other partitions having  at  least  the  same
      fire-resistance  rating  as  the ceiling. All such fire-rated partitions
      shall be constructed as set forth in section 27-340 or  subdivision  (a)
      of  section  27-341,  as  appropriate.  The  concealed  space above such
      ceiling shall be firestopped into areas  not  exceeding  three  thousand
      square  feet  with materials listed in section 27-345 of this subchapter
      for the full  height  of  the  concealed  space.  Access  to  each  such
      concealed  space may be through one or more openings, not exceeding nine
      square feet and protected by self-closing opening protectives having the
      fire-protection rating required by table 5-3.
        (1) Firestopping shall not be required where  the  structural  members
      within  the  concealed  space  are individually protected with materials
      having the required fire-resistance rating, or where the ceiling is  not
      an essential part of the fire-resistive assembly; nor shall firestopping
      be  required  where  a concealed space is sprinklered in accordance with
      the construction requirements of subchapter seventeen of this chapter.
        (b) Electrical and other openings in ceilings.  Ceilings  required  to
      have   a   fire-resistance   rating   may   be  pierced  to  accommodate
      noncombustible electric outlet boxes or recessed  lighting  fixtures  if
      the  aggregate  area  of  such  openings  does not exceed sixteen square
      inches in each ninety square feet of ceiling  area  and  the  electrical
      outlet  boxes  or recessed lighting fixtures are constructed of steel at
      least  .022  inches  thick  and   sealed   tightly   at   the   ceiling.
      Noncombustible  pipes,  ducts,  and  additional  or larger electrical or
      other service facilities may pierce ceilings that are required to have a
      fire-resistance rating only when the type of ceiling to be used has been
      tested with  such  types  of  facilities  installed  in  place  and  the
      proportionate  area  of  openings for such facilities to be installed in
      the ceiling does not exceed the proportionate area of such  openings  in
      the  assembly tested, and provided no opening is larger than that in the
      assembly tested. Protection for such  openings  shall  be  the  same  as
      provided  in  the  test.  Duct openings installed in accordance with the
      foregoing  shall  be  protected  by  fire  dampers  complying  with  the
      requirements of subchapter thirteen of this chapter.

Section 27-328 ::    
        
     
        §  27-328  Fire  retardant  treated wood. (a) Material. Fire-retardant
      treated wood shall be pressure treated with fire retardant chemicals  in
      accordance  with  reference standards RS 5-3 and RS 5-4. Where used as a
      structural element or as furring, the material shall have a flame spread
      rating not greater than  twenty-five  when  tested  in  accordance  with
      reference  standard  RS 5-5 when exposed for a period of at least thirty
      minutes, with no evidence of significant progressive  combustion.  Where
      used  as interior finish or trim, the material shall have a flame spread
      rating that meets the requirements of section 27-348 of this  subchapter
      for  the location in which it is used. Subsequent to treatment, material
      two inches thick or less shall be air dried or kiln dried to an  average
      moisture content of not more than nineteen percent.
        (b)   Label.   All   fire-retardant   treated   wood  shall  bear  the
      identification of a testing laboratory or  producer  certifying  to  the
      performance  thereof,  in accordance with the acceptance requirements of
      section 27-131 of article seven of subchapter one of this chapter.
        (c) Application. Fire-retardant treated wood may  not  be  used  where
      exposed to the weather or in interior spaces where the relative humidity
      is normally eighty percent or more. There shall be no fabrication of the
      material  after  treatment,  such  as  cutting, shaping, or grooving for
      splines or ring connectors so as to expose  untreated  surfaces,  except
      that  the  material  may  be  cut  to  length, shaped, or grooved if the
      exposed surfaces or edges are tightly butted against other material that
      is noncombustible  or  that  is  fire  retardant  treated,  so  that  no
      untreated wood is left exposed to danger of ignition. Holes may be bored
      or  cut  for  plumbing or heating pipes and for electric outlets only if
      the openings are coverd with tightly-fitted  noncombustible  escutcheons
      or cover plates. The allowable working stresses of the material shall be
      ninety  percent  of  the allowable stresses for untreated lumber of like
      classification.
        (d) Where permitted in construction group  I.  Fire-retardant  treated
      wood  may  be used in buildings of construction group I in the following
      cases:
        (1) As permitted by table 3-4.
        (2) For interior non-bearing partitions that are not required to  have
      a fire-resistance rating.
        (3)  For  interior furring and blocking of exterior walls, furring and
      blocking of interior walls and  partitions,  and  framing  of  suspended
      ceilings  provided  the furring, blocking, and framing do not affect the
      integrity, or reduce the fire-resistance  rating,  of  the  construction
      element.
        (4) For interior finish and trim.
        (e)  Area  increase.  Fire-retardant  treated  wood  may  be  used  in
      construction group II buildings in  lieu  of  untreated  wood  for  wall
      studs,   bearing  partition  studs,  columns,  beams,  girders,  joists,
      rafters, trusses, sole and cap plates, subflooring and roof  decks,  and
      when  so used, the area limitations of tables 4-1 and 4-2, for buildings
      of construction group II, may be increased by thirty-three and one-third
      percent.
