Section 27-331 ::    
        
     
        §  27-331  Exterior  walls.  Exterior  walls  shall  comply  with  the
      fire-resistance rating requirements of table 3-4.  Where  provisions  of
      this  code  require a space or facility to be enclosed, the construction
      requirements for the enclosure shall not apply to any exterior wall that
      forms part of the enclosure.
        (a) Openings in exterior walls. In addition  to  the  requirements  of
      table  3-4  and  subchapters  six  and  eight  of this chapter, exterior
      openings above the third floor level of a building or above a height  of
      forty  feet,  except  buildings  in  occupancy  group  J-3, open parking
      structures, and buildings of construction classes II-D and  II-E,  shall
      have  opening  protectives when (1) any part of the opening is less than
      thirty feet distant in a direct unobstructed line not in the same plane,
      from an opening in another building or from a wood frame building or (2)
      any part of the opening is above and less than thirty feet in  a  direct
      unobstructed line from, any roof construction that has a fire-resistance
      rating  of  less  than one hour or that has unprotected openings therein
      within this distance, whether the  roof  construction  is  on  the  same
      building or on an adjacent building.
        (b)  Opening  protective  required  ratings.  In  a  building or space
      classified in occupancy  group  A,  all  opening  protectives  shall  be
      three-quarter   hour   (class   E)   opening   protectives  meeting  the
      requirements of reference standard RS 5-8.  Such  protectives  shall  be
      fixed  self-closing  or  automatic. Alternatively, these openings may be
      protected with three-quarter hour (class F)  protectives  together  with
      outside   sprinklers   installed   in   accordance   with   construction
      requirements of subchapter seventeen of this  chapter.  In  such  cases,
      there  shall  be an automatic dry pipe sprinkler head centered over each
      opening with the orifice  directed  against  the  opening.  All  opening
      protectives  required  by  table  3-4  or  by  subdivision  (a) above in
      buildings  classified  in  other  than  occupancy  group  A   shall   be
      three-quarter hour (class F) openings.
        (c)  First  story  openings. Opening protectives required by table 3-4
      may be omitted in show windows or other openings on the lowest story  of
      a building facing on a street or public space.
        (d) Nonautomatic protectives. Required opening protectives in exterior
      openings,  if not self-closing or automatic, shall be kept closed by the
      occupants at all times when not required for light or ventilation  under
      the provisions of subchapter twelve of this chapter.
        (e)  Construction of unprotected openings. Exterior windows and doors,
      including their frames and glazing, that are not required by  this  code
      to have a fire-protection rating, may be of combustible materials. Below
      a  height of seventy-five feet, slow-burning plastic glazing may be used
      in windows. Glazing in balcony doors shall comply with the  requirements
      of  paragraph  four of subdivision (g) of section 27-369 of article five
      of subchapter six of this chapter.
        (f) Vertical  separation  of  openings.  In  buildings  classified  in
      occupancy groups A, B, C, D and E, exceeding three stories or forty feet
      in  height,  openings  located  vertically above one another in exterior
      walls except in stairway enclosures, shall be separated  by  a  spandrel
      wall  at  least  three  feet high between the top of one opening and the
      bottom of the opening immediately above; or each such opening above  the
      lower one shall be protected against fire by an opening protective; or a
      fire canopy of noncombustible materials, extending out at least two feet
      horizontally  from  the  wall  and  at least as long as the width of the
      lower opening, shall be constructed between the two openings.  Spandrels
      and  fire  canopies  shall  be  constructed  to  provide  at  least  the
      fire-resistance rating required for the exterior wall, but in  no  event
      less than one hour.

        c.  Plastic.  Plastic  used  for  the  glazing of skylights other than
      skylights over stairways and shafts shall be slow burning  plastic.  The
      aggregate  area  of  skylight  openings,  other  than over stairways and
      shafts, shall not exceed thirty-nine per cent of the floor area  of  any
      room or space sheltered by the roof in which they are located. The edges
      of   plastic,   if  exposed,  shall  be  protected  by  metal  or  other
      noncombustible material. Skylights in which plastic is used, if on roofs
      having a pitch of twenty degrees to the horizontal  or  less,  shall  be
      constructed in accordance with the following:
        1.  The  area  within the curbs of each skylight shall not exceed five
      square feet, except that this area may be of any size, limited  only  by
      other  provisions  of  this  section,if  the opening is protected on all
      sides by a noncombustible railing thirty-six inches in height  complying
      with  the  provisions  of  section 27-558 of article three of subchapter
      nine of this chapter for railings; or the skylight  is  subdivided  into
      areas  of  five  square  feet  or less by noncombustible muntins or bars
      capable of supporting a live load of three hundred pounds at any  point;
      or a noncombustible screen or grid capable of supporting a load of three
      hundred  pounds  over  any  one foot by two foot area as provided above,
      integral with, or not more than three feet below the skylight, with  the
      wire or bars spaced into areas of five square feet or less (if above the
      roof, the wires shall be of corrosion resistive metal).
    
        2.  There  shall  be  a  minimum  clear distance of three feet between
      skylights.
        (3)  Separation  of skylights from structures. There shall be at least
      ten feet between a plain glass or plastic skylight and  any  door  in  a
      stair  bulkhead located above the roof in which the skylight is located,
      and at least ten feet between such a skylight and  any  opening  in  any
      roof structure or other wall above the roof not equipped with an opening
      protective. On buildings up to one hundred feet in height there shall be
      at  least  ten  feet  from  such  a  skylight  to the outside face of an
      exterior wall facing on a frontage space.
        (4) SCREENS.  Plain  glass  skylights  shall  be  protected  on  their
      underside  by  noncombustible  screens  having  a  mesh not smaller than
      three-quarters of an inch by three-quarters of an inch nor  larger  than
      one  inch by one inch of at least No. 12 B. & S. gauge wires. The screen
      shall be installed tight against the roof opening or  shall  project  on
      all  sides  for  a  distance of not less than the distance of the screen
      below the glass, and shall be of such material and construction so as to
      support a load of three hundred pounds over any one  foot  by  two  foot
      area. The provisions for wire glass or screen protection shall not apply
      to glass block skylights.
        (e)  Greenhouses.  Greenhouses  on  the  roofs of buildings other than
      buildings of construction class II-D or II-E  shall  be  constructed  of
      noncombustible  framework  and shall be glazed with plain or wire glass,
      or slow burning plastic. The floors of greenhouses shall be  constructed
      at  least  as  required  for  roof  construction  in  table  3-4 for the
      construction class of the building on which it is located.
        (f) Construction of sloping roofs. Roofs having a slope of  more  than
      sixty  degrees to the horizontal shall be constructed of material having
      the same fire-resistance rating as required for an exterior  non-bearing
      wall  of  the  building  of  which it is a part. When the slope is sixty
      degrees or less to the horizontal, the sloping roof shall be constructed
      as required for the roof of the building. Where  the  back  of  a  false
      mansard  is  exposed  to  the  outdoors,  the back shall be covered with
      noncombustible material or with roof coverings as required for the  roof
      of the building.
        (g)   Dormers.  Roofs  of  dormers  shall  be  of  the  same  type  of
      construction and have roof covering of the same class  as  required  for
      the roof of the building on which they are located. The walls of dormers
      shall be constructed of materials having the same fire resistance rating
      as required for non-bearing exterior walls of the building on which they
      are  located;  except  that  in  buildings of construction classes II-A,
      II-B, II-C, and II-D,  the  walls  may  be  constructed  of  combustible
      framing  provided that the outside face of the framing is protected with
      noncombustible sheathing and the  aggregate  area  of  all  such  dormer
      walls, including openings therein, does not exceed twenty percent of the
      roof area.
        (h) Water tanks.
        (1)  SUPPORTS. All water tanks placed in or on a building and having a
      capacity of more  than  five  hundred  gallons  shall  be  supported  on
      noncombustible  walls  or  framing. When such tank is located within the
      building, above the lowest story, its framing shall be fire protected as
      required for columns supporting one floor or the tank shall  be  located
      within  a  room  or  space  that  is enclosed with construction having a
      fire-resistance rating equivalent to that  otherwise  required  for  the
      protection of the framing.
        (i)   Cooling   towers.   Cooling   towers  shall  be  constructed  of
      noncombustible materials, except as follows:
    
        (1) Outside the fire districts,  when  located  on  a  building  three
      stories or forty feet in height or less of construction group I, cooling
      towers may be constructed of combustible materials provided they are not
      more than fifteen feet high and do not exceed seven hundred fifty square
      feet in area.
        (2)  Outside  the  fire  districts, when located on the ground and not
      exceeding three stories or forty feet in height  or  one  thousand  five
      hundred  square  feet  in  area,  cooling  towers  may be constructed of
      combustible material provided they are  protected  by  a  noncombustible
      screen,  fence, or wall at least twenty feet from the tower and at least
      seven feet high.
        (3) Filling and drift eliminators may be of combustible  materials  if
      the  towers  are  provided with automatic sprinkler protection complying
      with the construction provisions of subchapter seventeen.
        (4) Filling and drift eliminators  may  be  of  combustible  materials
      where  the  towers are not provided with automatic sprinkler protection,
      provided all of the following conditions are met:
        a. The cooling tower is constructed of noncombustible material;
        b. The cooling tower is located on a building  in  construction  group
      I-A or I-B;
        c.  The cooling tower and filling and drift eliminators are located at
      least thirty feet away from any windows or fresh air intakes  which  are
      at  an  elevation  above the roof on which the cooling tower is located,
      whether in the same building or in an adjoining building;
        d. The cooling tower is located not less than fifteen  feet  from  the
      nearest lot line; and
        e.  The  cooling  tower  is  located  not  less than ten feet from any
      chimney, except that the distance shall be not  less  than  twenty  feet
      from a chimney venting products of combustion other than from gas or oil
      fired appliances, whether on the same building or an adjoining building.
        (5)  In no event shall cooling towers or filling and drift eliminators
      be constructed of materials that contain asbestos.
        (j) Miscellaneous roof structures. The following roof  structures  may
      be  constructed  of  combustible  material if less than twelve feet high
      above the roof: antenna  supports;  flagpoles;  clothes  drying  frames;
      duckboarding or platforms that do not cover more than twenty per cent of
      the roof area at that level.
