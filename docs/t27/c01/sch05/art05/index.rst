      non-combustible materials or assembly  of  noncombustible  materials  to
      provide the fire-resistance ratings required by table 5-2. Vertical fire
      divisions  shall  be  continuous between foundation, roof, or horizontal
      fire divisions, and  through  any  concealed  space  in  floor  or  roof
      construction.  Horizontal  fire  divisions  shall  be continuous between
      exterior walls and/or vertical fire divisions.
        (a) When roof construction is combustible on both sides of a  vertical
      fire  division, the vertical fire division shall extend through the roof
      construction to a height of at least four inches above the high point at
      the roof framing. Decking shall tightly butt the  fire  division.  Above
      the  decking  of  roofs  that  are  flatter  than  twenty degrees to the
      horizontal, blocking shall be constructed to form cants on both sides of
      the fire division with slopes not steeper than 1:4. Combustible  decking
      shall not extend over the top of the fire division.
        (b)  Except  as required in subdivision (c) of this section, when roof
      construction is noncombustible on one or both sides of a  vertical  fire
      division,  the  vertical fire division may terminate at the underside of
      the noncombustible roof construction provided the junction of  the  wall
      and roof construction is made smoke tight.
        (c)  When  a vertical fire division is required by table 5-2 to have a
      fire-resistance rating of three or four hours, and the roof construction
      has a fire-resistance rating of less than two hours, the  fire  division
      shall  extend  above  the  roof  construction to form a parapet at least
      three feet high.
        (d) Fire divisions  shall  be  so  constructed  that  the  removal  or
      collapse  of  construction  on one side will not endanger the support of
      construction on the other side.
        (e) Fire divisions shall be made smoketight  at  their  junction  with
      exterior  walls.  In  buildings  of  construction  class  II-D and II-E,
      exterior walls shall be constructed of noncombustible  materials  for  a
      distance  of at least eighteen inches on each side of the fire division,
      or the fire division shall project at least twelve  inches  through  the
      exterior wall.
        (f)  Fire  divisions  may  be  offset  if the construction between the
      offset  divisions,  including  their   supports,   has   at   the   same
      fire-resistance  rating  as  the  fire  division, with all hollow spaces
      within the construction firestopped with noncombustible material.
        (g) Where combustible members such as joists, beams, or  girders  bear
      on,  or  frame  into,  vertical  fire  divisions, such members shall not
      extend through the wall and shall have at least  four  inches  of  solid
      noncombustible  material  below,  at  the sides, and at the ends of each
      such member.
        (h) Chases or recesses shall not be cut into fire divisions so  as  to
      reduce  their  thickness  below  that  required  for the fire-resistance
      rating.
        (i) Vertical fire divisions that are hollow shall be firestopped  with
      at least four inches of noncombustible material so as to prevent passage
      of  flame,  smoke,  or  hot gases through the hollow spaces to the story
      above or below, or to hollow spaces  within  connecting  floor  or  roof
      construction.

Section 27-348 ::    
        
     
        ยง  27-348  Interior  finish.  (a) Definition. For the purposes of this
      section, interior finish  shall  mean  those  materials  that  form  the
      exposed  interior surfaces of a building and that are part of or affixed
      to walls, fixed or folding partitions, ceilings, and other  construction
      elements.
        (b)  Classification.  Interior finish materials shall be classified in
      accordance with the surface flame-spread rating obtained  as  prescribed
      in the provisions of reference standard RS 5-5. Where an interior finish
      material is comprised of two or more materials laminated, glued, nailed,
      or otherwise secured together, the test rating for flame spread shall be
      based  upon  the composite of the materials in the form in which it will
      be used in construction. Interior finish materials shall be  grouped  in
      the  following  classes,  in  accordance with their surface flame spread
      characteristics:
     
                Interior Finish Class         Flame-Spread Rating
                          A                         0 to  25
                          B                        26 to  75
                          C                        76 to 225
                          D                        Over  225
     
        (c)  Requirements.  Interior  finishes  and  exposed   structural   or
      construction materials shall have a flame-spread rating not greater than
      that designated by the class prescribed for the various occupancy groups
      in  which  they  are  used,  as listed in table 5-4. Exceptions to these
      requirements are:
        (1) Finish flooring and floor coverings,  which  are  subject  to  the
      requrements of section 27-351.
        (2)  Wall  coverings  and  coatings  that are less than 0.036 in total
      thickness, when applied directly to a noncombustible, or  fire-retardant
      treated wood, substrate.
        (3) Exposed structural members and planking in buildings of class II-A
      construction,  which may be left exposed in any room or space, except in
      exits.
        (4) Twenty per cent (20%) of the aggregate wall and  ceiling  area  of
      any  room, space, or corridor required to have a class A or B rating may
      be finished with materials having a class C rating. This allowance shall
      include  the  area  of  doors,  folding  partitions,  windows,  glazing,
      skylights,   luminous   ceilings,  trim,  bases,  chair  rails,  panels,
      moldings, etc. This exception shall not operate as  a  waiver  of  other
      requirements of this code relating to opening protectives.
        (5)  When  a sprinkler system is provided in any room or space, and is
      installed in compliance with the construction provisions  of  subchapter
      seventeen  of  this  chapter, interior finish materials may be one class
      higher in flame-spread rating than required by tables 5-4.
        (d) Smoke density. No material shall be used for  interior  finish  in
      the  following  locations  if  the  material  develops  smoke in greater
      density than the rating shown, based upon a test conducted in accordance
      with the provisions of reference standard RS  5-5.  Materials  used  for
      interior finish that cover not more than twenty percent of the aggregate
      wall  and  ceiling  area of any room, space, or corridor shall be exempt
      from the above requirements.

        (e) Toxicity. No material shall be used in any interior location that,
      upon  exposure  to  fire  will  produce  products  of  decomposition  or
      combustion that are more toxic in  point  of  concentration  than  those
      given  off by wood or paper when decomposing or burning under comparable
      conditions.
        (f) Attachment of interior finish.
        (1) To be credited with the same  rating,  interior  finish  materials
      that  were  applied  to  a substrate when tested shall be applied at the
      building to an equivalent substrate.
        (2) Interior finish materials shall be cemented or  otherwise  secured
      in  place in the same manner and with materials equivalent to those used
      in flame-spread tests conducted in accordance with  subdivision  (b)  of
      this section for the applicable classification.
        (3)  Where walls, ceilings, partitions, or other construction elements
      are required to have a fire-resistance rating  or  are  required  to  be
      constructed  of  noncombustible  materials,  and  the interior finish is
      secured to studs or furring, the surface of the interior  finish  facing
      the concealed space shall either have a class A rating, shall be applied
      to  a  substrate  that has a class A rating, or shall have the concealed
      space completely filled with noncombustible material.

        a. In determining the applicable requirements for  rooms  or  enclosed
      spaces, the occupancy group classification of the room or enclosed space
      shall  be  the  governing  factor,  regardless  of  the  occupancy group
      classification of the building. For the purposes of this table, the area
      of  a  room  shall  be  that  floor  area  contained  within   enclosing
      construction   in  which  interior  doors  or  other  interior  openings
      represent not more than  ten  percent  of  the  area  of  the  enclosing
    
      construction.   Interior  doors  or  windows  that  are  constructed  of
      noncombustible materials and that are self-closing or automatic  may  be
      ignored  in  computing  door  or opening area. Rooms or spaces that have
      unprotected  openings  constituting more than ten percent of the area of
      enclosing construction shall not  be  considered  as  a  room.  Interior
      finish  requirements  for  rooms  are based upon rooms being enclosed in
      ceiling high partitions. Partitions,  to  be  considered  ceiling  high,
      shall  extend up to the floor or roof construction above or to a ceiling
      having at least a three-quarter hour fire-resistance rating.  Partitions
      that  do  not  comply  with  this requirement shall not be considered as
      enclosing the spaces, and the rooms or  spaces  on  both  sides  thereof
      shall be considered as one.
        b.  Rooms  or spaces through which it is necessary for occupants of an
      adjacent room to pass in order to reach the only  exit  shall,  for  the
      purposes  of  this  table,  be  considered  as  corridors. Where used in
      corridors, class B finish material shall not extend more than fifty feet
      between separations of class A finish material that  are  at  least  two
      feet wide.
        c.  On  the  street floor of one-story buildings in construction group
      II, ceilings, beams, trusses, etc. that  are  twenty  feet  or  more  in
      height from the floor to their lowest part, may have a class C finish.
        d.  Class  C  interior  finish  may  be  used in offices, or groups of
      offices, whose use is accessory to an occupancy, provided  such  offices
      are  separated from the occupancy, by construction having at least a two
      hour fire-resistance rating.
        e. Class C interior finish may be used in  the  residential  rooms  of
      one-  and two-story motels when there is a direct exit from each room to
      the exterior.
        f. Interior finish when used in the following spaces shall be at least
      class B:
        (1) Kitchens, cooking spaces, and pantries in buildings classified  in
      occupancy groups other than J-2 and J-3.
        (2) Repair and maintenance rooms.
        (3) Boiler rooms and incinerator combustion rooms.
