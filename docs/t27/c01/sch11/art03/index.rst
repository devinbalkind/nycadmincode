Section 27-668
--------------

Section 27-668 ::    
        
     
        § 27-668 Soil bearing pressures. The loads to be used in computing the
      bearing pressures on materials directly underlying footings shall be the
      total  column, pier, or wall reactions determined in accordance with the
      provisions of subchapter nine of this chapter, on the basis  of  reduced
      live  load;  plus  the weight of the foundations; plus the weight of any
      soil, fill, and slabs on grade that is included within  vertical  planes
      projected  upward  from  the  extreme limits of the footing to the final
      ground surface. Live load on grade, or on slabs on grade,  within  these
      limits  shall  also  be  included.  Impact  loads shall be considered in
      accordance with the provisions of section 27-673 of this article.
    
    
    
    
    
    
    

Section 27-669
--------------

Section 27-669 ::    
        
     
        §  27-669  Pile  reactions.  The  loads  to  be used in computing pile
      reactions shall be determined as provided  in  section  27-668  of  this
      article  except  that  where  piles penetrate fill, clay, silt, peat, or
      similar compressible strata, the pile loads shall be  increased  by  the
      amount  of  drag exerted by such material, and by any overlaying strata,
      during consolidation. Computation of the amount of drag  shall  consider
      the  amount  of  added fill, the amount of shear strain between pile (or
      group) and the soil, the ratio of vertical to horizontal pressure in the
      soil, and  the  arrangement  of  the  piles.  The  soil  surrounding  or
      underlying  the  pile  cap  shall  not  be  considered  as providing any
      vertical support for the cap.
    
    
    
    
    
    
    

Section 27-670
--------------

Section 27-670 ::    
        
     
        §  27-670  Lateral  loads.  (a) Earth and ground water pressure. Every
      foundation wall or other wall serving as a retaining structure shall  be
      designed  to  resist,  in addition to the vertical loads acting thereon,
      the incident lateral earth pressures and  surcharges,  plus  hydrostatic
      pressures  corresponding  to  the  maximum  probable ground water level.
      Retaining walls shall be designed to resist at  least  the  superimposed
      effects  of  the  total  static  lateral  soil  pressure,  excluding the
      pressure caused by any temporary surcharge, plus an earthquake force  of
      0.045wsh¥  (horizontal backfill surface), where ws equals unit weight of
      soil and h  equals  wall  height.  Surcharges  which  are  applied  over
      extended  periods  of time shall be included in the total static lateral
      soil pressure and their earthquake lateral force shall be  computed  and
      added  to  the  force  of  0.045wsh¥. The earthquake force from backfill
      shall be distributed as an inverse triangle over the height of the wall.
      The point of application  of  the  earthquake  force  from  an  extended
      duration  surcharge  shall be determined on an individual case basis. If
      the backfill consists of loose saturated  granular  soil,  consideration
      shall be given to the potential liquefication of the backfill during the
      seismic loading using reference standard RS 9-6.
        (b)  Wind  and  other superstructure loads. Provision shall be made to
      resist lateral loads imposed on the superstructure due to wind or  other
      causes.
        (c)  Soil movements. Buildings shall not be constructed in areas where
      the soil is subject to lateral movements unless  positive  provision  is
      made to prevent such movements.
    
    
    
    
    
    
    

Section 27-671
--------------

Section 27-671 ::    
        
     
        §  27-671  Eccentricities.  Eccentricity  of  loading  in foundations,
      including eccentricity of loading on the bases of retaining walls, shall
      be investigated and the maximum soil pressure or pile load  (considering
      eccentricity)  shall  be  kept  within  the  safe  capacity  thereof  as
      established in articles four and eight of this subchapter. Soil pressure
      and pile load due to eccentricity shall be  computed  on  the  basis  of
      straight  line distribution of foundation reaction. However, other modes
      of distribution of the foundation reaction may be  assumed,  subject  to
      the  approval  of  the  commissioner, if it can be demonstrated that the
      pile and/or soil is capable of sufficient plastic deformation to develop
      such mode of distribution without failure.
    
    
    
    
    
    
    

Section 27-672
--------------

Section 27-672 ::    
        
     
        §  27-672 Uplift forces. Uplift and overturning forces due to wind and
      hydrostatic pressure shall be considered.
    
    
    
    
    
    
    

Section 27-673
--------------

Section 27-673 ::    
        
     
        §  27-673  Impact.  Impact  forces  may  be neglected in the design of
      foundations, except for foundations bearing on loose granular soils, or,
      regardless of the type of  soil  material,  for  foundations  supporting
      cranes, heavy machinery, and moving equipment, or where the ratio of the
      live  load  causing  impact to the total of the reactions from live load
      applied without impact plus dead load exceeds one-third.
    
    
    
    
    
    
    

Section 27-674
--------------

Section 27-674 ::    
        
     
        §   27-674  Stability.  The  provisions  of  article  twelve  of  this
      subchapter shall apply.
