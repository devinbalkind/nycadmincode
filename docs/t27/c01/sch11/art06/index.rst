Section 27-684 ::    
        
     
        §  27-684  Footings.  Inspections  of  subgrade of footings, piers and
      walls shall comply with the requirements of section  27-723  of  article
      thirteen of this subchapter.
        (a)  Wood  footings.  Wood  footings  may  be used only for wood frame
      structures. Wood footings shall be given  a  preservative  treatment  in
      accordance with reference standard RS 11-4.
        (b)  Pole  buildings.  Buildings  not  more than one story high may be
      supported on poles embedded in the ground. Wood poles shall  conform  to
      the  requirements  of  reference  standard  RS 11-5 and shall be given a
      preservative treatment in accordance with reference  standard  RS  11-4.
      Steel  poles  embedded in the soil shall be protected as required by the
      provisions of paragraph one of subdivision (c) of section 27-685 of this
      article.
        (c) Grillages. Grillage beams shall be provided with  proper  spacers,
      stiffners,  and  diaphragms,  or  the  space  between the beams shall be
      filled with concrete or grout. In addition, all steel grillages shall be
      fully protected against corrosion  by  encasement,  coating  with  metal
      protection  of  a  type  satisfactory  to  the  commissioner or by other
      approved device.
        (d) Design.
        (1) CONCRETE FOOTINGS. Concrete  footings  shall  be  proportioned  in
      accordance   with   the   provisions  of  reference  standard  RS  10-3.
      Reinforcement shall extend to within four inches of  the  edges  of  the
      footing.
        (2)  MASONRY  FOOTINGS.  Masonry used for the construction of footings
      shall be of solid units.
        a.  Reinforced  masonry  footings  shall  meet  the  requirements   of
      reference  standard  RS  10-2 and shall be proportioned similarly to the
      proportioning of reinforced concrete footings.
        b. Unreinforced masonry footings shall be of  such  dimension  that  a
      sloping  plane  extending  downward from the top of the footing where it
      intersects the pier of wall, to the bottom of the footing, and  measured
      at  the  angle  with  the  horizontal  that  is indicated below, will be
      contained entirely within the footing:
        Soil bearing capacity of three tons per square foot  or  less--  sixty
      degrees
        Soil  bearing capacity between three tons per square foot and six tons
      per square foot--seventy degrees
        Soil bearing capacity greater than six tons per square foot  shall  be
      investigated.
      The  compressive stress in the footing, based on the assumption that the
      vertical load is uniformly distributed over horizontal sections  bounded
      by  said planes, shall not exceed the values given in reference standard
      RS 10-1.
    
    
    
    
    
    
    

Section 27-685
--------------

Section 27-685 ::    
        
     
        §  27-685  Foundation  piers.  Foundation  piers  shall be designed as
      columns. Reinforced concrete piers shall be designed in accordance  with
      the   provisions   of   reference   standard  RS  10-3.  Reinforced  and
      unreinforced masonry piers shall be  designed  in  accordance  with  the
      provisions  of  reference  standards  RS  10-2 and RS 10-1. Unreinforced
      concrete piers shall be designed in accordance with subdivision  (b)  of
      this section.
        (a)  Lateral  support.  The  equivalent  unbraced  length  of  a  pier
      supported by lateral soil pressure may be  determined  by  a  recognized
      method of elastic analysis. Alternatively, such a pier may be assumed to
      be hinged, but laterally braced at intervals equal to the full height of
      the  pier  or  eight  times  the  least  lateral  dimension of the pier,
      whichever is the lesser value. The provisions of subdivision (e) of this
      section shall apply.
        (b) Unreinforced concrete piers. Where unreinforced concrete piers are
      used, the allowable compressive stress shall not exceed 0.25f'c and  the
      center  of cross section of the pier at any level shall not deviate from
      the line of action of the resultant of all forces (which line of  action
      shall consider the eccentricities due to all loads and moments acting on
      the pier) by an amount more than one-sixtieth of its height or one-tenth
      of  its least lateral dimension and the ratio of the height to the least
      lateral dimension shall not exceed eight. For larger values of the ratio
      of  the  height  to  the  least  lateral  dimensions,  or  for   greater
      eccentricities, piers shall be reinforced.
        (c)  Metal shells. Where piers are encased by a metal shell, the shell
      may be considered as contributing to the structural strength of the pier
      provided that the thickness is one-eighth inch or greater,  and  subject
      to the following requirements:
        (1)   Where  boring  records  or  site  conditions  indicate  possible
      deleterious action on the shell, where  any  portion  of  the  shell  is
      embedded  in  ash,  cinder fill or garbage fill, where the encased piers
      are used for support of chemical plants, piles of coal, or  under  other
      conditions  conducive  to chemical seepage or corrosive action, or where
      the encased piers are used for support of electrical generating  plants,
      the metal shells shall be protected against deterioration by encasement,
      coating, or other device acceptable to the commissioner.
        (2)  The  area  of  the  metal  section of the shell multiplied by the
      efficiency of the horizontal joints shall be  considered  as  equivalent
      vertical reinforcement of the pier. The area of the metal section of the
      shell,  multiplied  by  the  efficiency of the vertical joints, shall be
      considered as equivalent spiral reinforcement of the pier.
        (d) Minimum dimensions. The provisions  of  subdivision  (e)  of  this
      section  shall apply. In addition, the plan dimensions of the pier shall
      not be less than those of the column above. If the  column  above  is  a
      steel  section resting on a base plate, the base plate and pier shall be
      proportioned for allowable bearing pressures as prescribed in  reference
      standards RS 10-1, RS 10-2, and RS 10-3.
        (e)  Filling.  The  provisions  of  subdivisions  (a)  and (d) of this
      section shall apply only where the fill (or backfill) is  placed  around
      the pier as controlled fill, and wherein the level of the fill is raised
      uniformly  around  the  entire  perimeter  of  the  pier. Where the fill
      operation is not controlled the least lateral dimension of a  foundation
      pier  shall be twenty-four inches and the pier shall be proportioned for
      lateral pressure equal to the pressure of a differential height of  fill
      equal  to  five feet, applied simultaneously with the other loads on the
      pier specified in article three of this subchapter.
    
    
    
    
    
    
    

Section 27-686

Section 27-686 ::    
        
     
        §  27-686  Foundation  walls.  (a) Concrete. Concrete foundation walls
      shall be  designed  in  accordance  with  the  provisions  of  reference
      standard  RS 10-3 relating to bearing or retaining walls. The equivalent
      unbraced height of a wall supported by  lateral  soil  pressure  may  be
      determined  by  a  recognized method of elastic analysis. Alternatively,
      such a wall may be assumed  to  be  laterally  braced  at  intervals  as
      follows:
        (1)  Where  fill  is  placed against both faces of the walls: the full
      height of the wall or eight times the thickness, whichever is the lesser
      value.
        (2) Where both faces of the wall are not in  contact  with  soil:  the
      height  of the unbraced section of the wall or eight times the thickness
      of the wall, whichever is greater, but not more than the full height  of
      the wall.
        (b)  Masonry. Masonry foundation walls shall conform to the provisions
      of reference standards RS 10-1 and RS 10-2, and the following:
        (1) TYPES. Masonry foundation walls may  be  of  plain  or  reinforced
      masonry  and  shall  be  of solid units, except that load bearing hollow
      units will be permitted for support of one- and two-story buildings.
        (2) WALL THICKNESS. Foundation walls of masonry shall be designed  and
      constructed  in accordance with the provisions of reference standards RS
      10-1 and RS 10-2, supplemented by the provisions of subdivision  (a)  of
      this  section,  relating  to  unbraced height. The thickness shall be at
      least six inches.

Section 27-687 ::    
        
     
        §  27-687  Construction  of footings, foundation piers, and foundation
      walls. The provisions of sections 27-661 and 27-723 of  this  subchapter
      shall apply. In addition, methods of installation and construction shall
      satisfy the following conditions:
        (a)  Footings, piers, or walls shall be founded on undisturbed soil or
      on satisfactorily compacted or prepared materials.
        (b) Accurate preparation  and  inspection  of  the  bearing  materials
      directly  underlying  the  foundation shall be possible; and the bearing
      area shall be substantially level or suitably benched.
        (c) Excavation shall  be  kept  substantially  free  of  water  during
      construction  of the foundation except that the use of tremie or similar
      underwater construction will be permitted in  the  case  of  foundations
      bearing  directly on rock, provided that the construction procedure will
      permit thorough cleaning and preparation of the rock surface,  and  that
      the  surface of the rock is maintained in a clean condition, unfouled by
      the inflow of soil or settlement of  the  fluid  suspension,  until  the
      concrete is in place.
