Section 27-720 ::    
        
     
        §  27-720  Boring  and  test  pit  operations.  Boring  and  test  pit
      operations shall be subject to controlled inspection, except that  fifty
      per  cent or less of the required number of borings and/or test pits may
      be inspected by an architect or engineer other  than  the  architect  or
      engineer  designated  for  controlled inspection. The records of borings
      and/or test pits shall be attested to as follows:
        (a) The architect or  engineer  shall  file  a  report  stating  which
      borings  and/or test pits were performed under his or her inspection and
      whether such inspection was performed personally or  otherwise.  If  the
      inspection  was  not  made  personally by the architect or engineer, the
      name and address of the inspector shall be noted. It  shall  be  stated:
      that  the  borings  and/or  test  pits  so  inspected were made and were
      carried to the depths indicated; that, to the best of the architect's or
      engineer's knowledge and belief, the description and  classification  of
      the  soils  are  a  true  description  of the samples recovered from the
      respective borings and/or test pits; that such samples were recovered at
      the  levels  indicated;  and  that  the  boring  and/or  test  pit  work
      progressed  in  such  manner  that  the samples recovered are reasonably
      representative of the subsurface conditions.
        (b) The accuracy of the other data indicated  on  the  boring  records
      shall be attested to by the drilling contractor or by the driller making
      the borings.
    
    
    
    
    
    
    

Section 27-721
--------------

Section 27-721 ::    
        
     
        §  27-721  Piling.  The installation of all piling shall be subject to
      controlled inspection. Such inspection shall be  performed  only  by  an
      architect  or engineer resident at the site, except that where more than
      one pile rig is working at  a  site,  inspection  of  the  work  may  be
      performed  by  nonlicensed  or nonregistered personnel working under the
      resident architect or engineer, who  need  act  only  in  a  supervisory
      capacity.  This  exception  shall  not  apply,  however, in the cases of
      timber or steel piles driven to end bearing as described in article  ten
      of  this subchapter. Materials for piling shall be subject to inspection
      requirements as prescribed in subchapter ten of this chapter  for  those
      or  like  materials.  In  all  cases,  an inspector shall be assigned to
      observe the operations of each rig.
    
    
    
    
    
    
    

Section 27-722
--------------

Section 27-722 ::    
        
     
        §  27-722  Footings, foundation piers, foundation walls and pile caps.
      The provisions of section 27-683 of article six of this subchapter shall
      apply.
    
    
    
    
    
    
    

Section 27-723
--------------

Section 27-723 ::    
        
     
        §  27-723  Subgrade  for  footings,  foundation  piers, and foundation
      walls.   The soil  material  directly  underlying  footings,  foundation
      piers,  and  foundation  walls  shall  be  inspected  by an architect or
      engineer after excavation and immediately prior to construction  of  the
      footings.  If  such inspection indicates that the soil conditions do not
      conform to those assumed for purposes of design  and  described  on  the
      plans,  or  are  unsatisfactory  due  to  disturbance,  then  additional
      excavation, reduction in allowable bearing pressure, or  other  remedial
      measures shall be adopted, as required. A copy of a report or reports on
      such  inspection  or inspections describing the conditions found and any
      necessary modification of the design, and bearing the signature  of  the
      architect  or  engineer  making the inspections, shall be filed with the
      commissioner.  In  addition,  notification  shall  be  received  by  the
      department  at  least  two  working  days  prior  to construction of the
      footing, pier, or foundation walls,  that  the  subgrade  is  ready  for
      inspection   unless  the  requirements  of  section  27-209  of  article
      twenty-one of subchapter one of this chapter have been met.

Section 27-724 ::    
        
     
        §  27-724  Construction  required  for  or  affecting  the  support of
      adjacent properties or buildings.  Except  in  cases  where  a  proposed
      excavation  will extend less than ten feet below the legally established
      grade, all underpinning operations and the construction  and  excavation
      of   temporary  or  permanent  cofferdams,  caissons,  braced  excavated
      surfaces,  or  other  constructions  or  excavations  required  for   or
      affecting  the  support  of  adjacent  properties  or buildings shall be
      subject  to  controlled  inspection.  The   details   of   underpinning,
      cofferdams,  caissons,  bracing, or other constructions required for the
      support of adjacent properties or buildings shall be shown on the  plans
      or prepared in the form of shop or detail drawings and shall be approved
      by the architect or engineer who prepared the plans.
