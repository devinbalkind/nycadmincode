Section 27-688
--------------

Section 27-688 ::    
        
     
        §  27-688  Administrative requirements. (a) Identification of piles. A
      plan showing clearly the designation of  all  piles  by  an  identifying
      system  shall  be  filed  with the commissioner prior to installation of
      such piles. All detailed records for  individual  piles  shall  bear  an
      identification  corresponding  to that shown on the plan. A copy of such
      plan shall be available at the site for inspection at all times.
        (b) Record of pile driving. A record of the penetration  and  behavior
      of  each  pile  during  installation  shall  be kept by the architect or
      engineer designated in  section  27-721  of  article  thirteen  of  this
      subchapter.    Such  records shall be prepared on forms furnished by, or
      satisfactory to, the commissioner  and,  upon  the  completion  of  pile
      installation,  shall  be  filed  with the commissioner together with the
      records of any additional borings  or  subsurface  information  obtained
      during  installation  of  the piles, and plans showing any deviations of
      the pile or related constructions (including  any  corrective  measures)
      from  the  details and locations shown on the approved plans. Inspection
      of piling and pile load tests  shall  conform  to  the  requirements  of
      section 27-721 of article thirteen of this subchapter.
    
    
    
    
    
    
    

Section 27-689
--------------

Section 27-689 ::    
        
     
        §  27-689  Minimum  pile  penetrations.  (a)  Required by soil bearing
      capacity. The provisions of paragraph one of subdivision (b) of  section
      27-700 of article eight of this subchapter shall apply.
        (b)  Required  for lateral restraint. The provisions of section 27-694
      of this article shall apply.
        (c) Piles located near a lot line. Piles located near a lot line shall
      be designed on the assumption that the adjacent lot will be excavated to
      a depth of ten feet below the nearest legally  established  curb  level.
      Where  such excavation would reduce the embedded length of the pile, the
      portion of the pile exposed shall be considered as providing no  lateral
      or  vertical  support, and the load-carrying determination in accordance
      with the provisions of article eight of this subchapter  shall  be  made
      after  the  resistance  offered by the soil that is subject to potential
      excavation has been discounted.
    
    
    
    
    
    
    

Section 27-690
--------------

Section 27-690 ::    
        
     
        § 27-690 Use of existing piles at demolished structures. Piles left in
      place  where  a  structure has been demolished shall not be used for the
      support of new construction unless satisfactory evidence, including load
      or hammer testing of representative piles, can  be  produced  indicating
      the  capacity,  length,  and  driving  conditions of the piles. The load
      bearing value for such existing piles shall be the least of  the  values
      indicated  by: (1) the load or hammer test, (2) the capacity of the pile
      as a structural member, and (3) the allowable bearing  pressure  on  the
      soil  underlying the pile tips, all in accordance with the provisions of
      article eight of this subchapter.
    
    
    
    
    
    
    

Section 27-691
--------------

Section 27-691 ::    
        
     
        § 27-691 Tolerance and modification of design due to field conditions.
      (a)  Tolerance in alignment of the pile axis. If the axis of any pile is
      installed out of plumb or deviates from the  specified  batter  by  more
      than  four  per  cent  of  the pile length, the design of the foundation
      shall be modified as may be necessary to resist the  resulting  vertical
      and lateral forces. In types of piles for which subsurface inspection is
      not possible, this determination shall be made on the exposed section of
      the  pile, which section, at the time of checking axial alignment, shall
      not be less than two feet. In piles  which  can  be  checked  for  axial
      alignment below the ground surface, the sweep of the pile axis shall not
      exceed four per cent of the embedded length.
        (b)  Tolerance  in  location  of  the head of the pile. A tolerance of
      three inches from the  designed  location  shall  be  permitted  in  the
      installation  of  each  pile,  without reduction in load capacity of the
      pile group.  Where piles are installed out of position in excess of this
      amount, the true loading on such piles shall be analytically  determined
      from  a survey which defines the actual location of the piles as driven,
      and using the actual eccentricity in the pile group with respect to  the
      line  of  action  of the applied load. If the total load on any pile, so
      determined, is in excess of one hundred ten per cent  of  the  allowable
      load bearing capacity, correction shall be made by installing additional
      piles  or  by  other methods of load distribution, as required to reduce
      the maximum pile load to one hundred ten per cent of the capacity.
        (c) Bent piles. Where piles have been bent  during  installation,  and
      the  amount of the bend exceeds the allowable tolerance for alignment of
      the pile axis in subdivision (a) of this section, the condition shall be
      investigated and, where required, correction made by the installation of
      additional piles, by strengthening  the  bent  piles,  by  reduction  in
      capacity or other means acceptable to the commissioner.
    
    
    
    
    
    
    

Section 27-692
--------------

Section 27-692 ::    
        
     
        §  27-692  Minimum spacing of piles. Piles shall be spaced to meet the
      following requirements:
        (1) Spacing of piles shall provide for adequate  distribution  of  the
      load  on  the  pile group to the supporting soil, in accordance with the
      provisions of subdivision (b) of section 27-700 of article eight of this
      subchapter.
        (2) In no case shall the minimum center-to-center spacing of piles  be
      less  than  twenty-four  inches,  nor  less than the values for specific
      types of piling as indicated in article ten of this  subchapter.  Unless
      special   measures  are  taken  to  assure  that  piles  will  penetrate
      sufficiently to meet the requirements of section 27-689 of this  article
      without  interfering  with  or  intersecting  each  other,  the  minimum
      center-to-center spacing of piles shall be twice the average diameter of
      the butt for round piles; one and three-quarters times the diagonal  for
      rectangular  piles;  or,  for taper piles, twice the diameter at a level
      two-thirds of the pile length measured up from  the  tip.  In  cases  of
      practical difficulty, the spacing of new piles from existing piles under
      an adjacent building may be less than the above values provided that the
      requirements  relating  to  minimum  embedment and pile interference are
      satisfied and that the soil under the proposed and existing buildings is
      not overloaded by the closer pile grouping.
    
    
    
    
    
    
    

Section 27-693
--------------

Section 27-693 ::    
        
     
        §  27-693  Minimum  section. Except as provided in article ten of this
      subchapter for timber piles, no tapered pile  shall  be  less  than  six
      inches  in  diameter  at  any  section, nor have less than an eight inch
      diameter at cutoff. The taper of any tapered section may be  uniform  or
      may  occur in steps. No pile of uniform section shall have a diameter of
      less than eight inches, or, if not circular, a dimension  of  less  than
      seven  and one-half inches. Tapered shoes or points of lesser dimensions
      may be attached to the tips of piles.
    
    
    
    
    
    
    

Section 27-694
--------------

Section 27-694 ::    
        
     
        § 27-694 Capping and bracing of piles. (a) Capping of piles.
        (1)  EMBEDMENT.  Tops  of  all  piles shall be embedded at least three
      inches in concrete caps. Such concrete shall conform to  the  provisions
      of  article  five  of subchapter ten of this chapter and shall extend at
      least four inches beyond the edge of all piles. Alternatively, and  only
      where  the  piles  project  above  the  future grade and will be readily
      accessible for visual inspection at all times, the tops of the piles may
      be capped with timber or steel caps, which shall  be  connected  to  the
      piles.  Cap  plates will not be required for steel H piles embedded in a
      reinforced concrete cap. Inspection of pile caps shall be as required in
      section 27-722 of article thirteen of this subchapter.
        (2) UPLIFT. Where piles are subject to uplift, they shall be  anchored
      into  the  cap  to  resist at least one and one-half times the amount of
      such  uplift  without  exceeding  the  basic   allowable   stresses   as
      established in subchapter ten.
        (3)  REINFORCEMENT.  Reinforcement shall be placed to provide at least
      three inches of clear cover, measured to the surface  of  the  pile  cap
      that is in contact with the ground. All reinforcement adjacent to timber
      or  concrete  piling  shall  have  a  minimum  of  one  inch of concrete
      protection. Reinforcement shall extend to  within  four  inches  of  the
      edges of the pile cap.
        (4)  DESIGN.  Except  as  modified  above, concrete pile caps shall be
      designed in accordance with the  provisions  of  reference  standard  RS
      10-3.
        (b)  Bracing  of  piles.  Except  for  short  piles  as  described  in
      subdivision (c) of this section, every pile shall be laterally braced to
      conform with one or more of the following provisions:
        (1) RIGID CAP. Three or more piles connected by a rigid cap  shall  be
      considered as being braced provided that the piles are located in radial
      directions  from  the  centroid of the group not less than sixty degrees
      apart (within a tolerance of three inches in location of  the  pile.)  A
      two-pile  group,  in a rigid cap, shall be considered to be braced along
      the axis connecting the two piles.
        (2) BRACE BEAMS. Piles may be braced by the use of brace beams or ties
      rigidly connecting to at least two other piles in radial directions  not
      less  than sixty degrees nor more than one hundred twenty degrees apart.
      Concrete brace beams shall have minimum dimensions of  one-twentieth  of
      the  clear  distance  between pile caps, but not less than eight inches.
      All brace beams shall be proportioned to resist  a  minimum  axial  load
      equal  to  three  per cent of the total axial load capacity of the piles
      that are to be  braced  by  that  beam,  plus  the  moment  due  to  any
      eccentricity  between  the  centroid  of  the pile group and the line of
      action of the applied load. Where underlain by soil of class 9-65, 10-65
      or 11-65, brace beams shall be proportioned to  support  the  weight  of
      soil,  slab-on-ground,  and  live  load  on  the  slab-on-ground that is
      contained within vertical  planes  projected  upward  from  the  lateral
      limits  of  the  brace  beam.  The design of brace beams to resist these
      loads shall conform to the provision of subchapter ten of this chapter.
        (3) CONCRETE SLAB-ON-GRADE. A  continuous  concrete  slab  or  mat  on
      grade, that is five inches or more in thickness and reinforced, and that
      extends  at  least  forty  feet in each direction and is anchored to the
      pile caps (or in which the piles are embedded at  least  three  inches),
      may  be  used in lieu of brace beams for bracing of pile caps, providing
      that the slab is supported  on  material  having  an  allowable  bearing
      pressure  of  one  and  one-half tons per square foot or better and such
      material is not underlain by nominally unsatisfactory bearing materials.
        (4) OTHER MEANS. Piles may be braced by anchors, anchor wall, or other
      means acceptable to the commissioner.
    
        (5) FLOOR SYSTEM. Single-pile or two-pile groups or a single  line  of
      piles  may  be  considered  to be adequately braced if connected to, and
      braced by, a self supporting floor system provided: (1) that the details
      and dimensions of the floor  and  the  wall  or  pier  are  of  adequate
      strength to resist lateral displacement of the pile cap under conditions
      of  maximum  eccentricity  of the applied load; and (2) that the wall or
      pier is braced until connection of the floor framing  is  made  and  the
      flooring (or slab) is in place.
        (6)  SPECIAL  REQUIREMENTS FOR BRACING BATTER PILES. The provisions of
      paragraphs one through five of this subdivision above  shall  apply.  In
      addition,  provisions  shall  be  made  to  oppose  the  lateral  thrust
      resulting from the pile inclination.
        (c) Bracing of short piles.
        (1) All pile caps supported by piles that penetrate less than ten feet
      below cutoff level or less than ten feet below  ground  level  shall  be
      braced  against lateral movement. Such bracing may consist of connection
      to other pile caps that encompass piles  embedded  more  than  ten  feet
      below  those  levels;  the  use  of  suitable  anchors,  connection to a
      slab-on-grade or the floor system as described in paragraphs  three  and
      five  of  subdivision (b) of this section, or by other equivalent means.
      The heads of the piles shall be fixed in the cap. In no event shall more
      than fifty percent of the  piles  in  the  foundation  of  any  building
      penetrate  less  than ten feet below cut-off-level or less than ten feet
      below ground level.
        (2) Where the embedded length of piles located near a lot  line  would
      be reduced to less than ten feet by excavation of the adjacent site to a
      depth  of  ten  feet  below  the  nearest  established  curb  level, the
      provisions of paragraph one of this subdivision shall apply.
    
    
    
    
    
    
    

Section 27-695
--------------

Section 27-695 ::    
        
     
        §  27-695  Splicing  of  piles.  Splices shall be constructed so as to
      provide and maintain true alignment and position of the component  parts
      of  the pile during installation and subsequent thereto, and shall be of
      adequate strength to transmit the vertical and lateral loads  (including
      tensions)  and the moments occurring in the pile section at the location
      of  the  splice  without  exceeding  the  allowable  stresses  for  such
      materials as established in subdivision (a) of section 27-700 of article
      eight  of  this  subchapter.  Except  for  piles  which  can be visually
      inspected after driving, splices shall develop at least fifty  per  cent
      of the capacity of the pile in bending. In addition, all pile splices in
      the upper ten feet of the pile section shall be capable of resisting (at
      allowable  working stresses) the moment and shear that would result from
      an assumed eccentricity of the pile load of three inches,  or  the  pile
      shall  be  braced in accordance with the provisions of section 27-694 of
      article seven of this subchapter to other piles that do not have splices
      in the upper ten feet of embedment. For piles located near a  lot  line,
      the  embedded length of such piles shall be determined on the basis that
      the adjacent site will be excavated to a depth of  ten  feet  below  the
      nearest established curb level.
    
    
    
    
    
    
    

Section 27-696
--------------

Section 27-696 ::    
        
     
        §   27-696   General  requirements  for  installation  of  piles.  (a)
      Protection of adjacent property. Piles shall be installed with  adequate
      provision for the protection of adjacent buildings and property.
        (b)  Protection  of  the  pile  during  installation.  Piling shall be
      handled and installed to the  required  penetration  and  resistance  by
      methods that leave their strength unimpaired and that develop and retain
      the   required  load-bearing  resistance.  Any  damaged  pile  shall  be
      satisfactorily repaired or the pile shall be rejected.  Subject  to  the
      approval of the commissioner, damaged piles may be used at a fraction of
      the  design  load  as determined by the architect or engineer in lieu of
      repair or rejection.
        (c) Protection of pile  materials  after  installation.  Where  boring
      records  or site conditions indicate possible deleterious action on pile
      materials due to soil constituents,  changing  water  levels,  or  other
      causes, such materials shall be adequately protected by preservatives or
      encasements  that  will  not be rendered ineffective by driving and that
      will prevent such deleterious action. The following specific  provisions
      shall apply:
        (1)  Untreated  timber piles shall not be used unless the top level of
      the pile is below the permanent water table. The permanent  water  table
      level  shall  not  be assumed higher than the invert level of any sewer,
      drain, or subsurface structure in the adjacent streets, nor higher  than
      the  water level at the site resulting from the lowest drawdown of wells
      or sumps, but in no case shall untreated timber piles be used where  the
      cut-off  level  is  less  than  ten feet below the adjacent legal grade.
      Where treated piles are required, preservative treatment  shall  consist
      of  impregnation  with  creosote  or  a  creosote solution or, for piles
      entirely embedded below grade, a pentachlorophenal solution may be used.
      Treatment shall be in accordance  with  all  requirements  of  reference
      standard RS 11-6.
        (2)  Piles  installed  in ash or garbage fills, cinder fills, or which
      are free-standing in or near a seawater environment, or which  are  used
      for  the  support  of  chemical  plants,  coal  piles  or  under similar
      conditions of chemical seepage or aggressive action, or which  are  used
      for  support  of  electrical  generating  plants,  shall be investigated
      regarding  the  need  for  special  protective  treatment   and,   where
      protective   treatment   is   indicated,   shall  be  protected  against
      deterioration by encasement, coating, or other device acceptable to  the
      commissioner.
        (d)  Equipment.  Equipment  and  methods for installing piles shall be
      such that piles are installed in their proper  position  and  alignment,
      without damage. Equipment shall be maintained in good repair.
    
    
    
    
    
    
    

Section 27-697
--------------

Section 27-697 ::    
        
     
        §  27-697  Use  of  uncased  concrete  pile shafts. The use of uncased
      shafts (i.e., where the concrete of the pile shaft is in direct  contact
      with  the  surrounding  soil)  will  be  permitted  under  the following
      conditions:
        (a) For bored piles. Where the bored hole is maintained free of  water
      before and during placement of the concrete and the sides and bottom can
      be  inspected prior to such placement, and provided that no displacement
      pile shall be installed within fifteen feet of any bored pile.
        (b)  For  driven  piles  (including  all  piles  wherein  installation
      utilizes  a  temporary  casing). The maximum length of the uncased shaft
      shall  be  limited  to  ten  feet  unless  otherwise  permitted  by  the
      commissioner.    Uncased  shafts  will be permitted to be formed in soil
      below the water table but shall not be formed in any soil of class  9-65
      that  is  of medium or soft consistency; in any soil of class 10-65 that
      is of medium or loose density; or in any soil of class 11-65.
    
    
    
    
    
    
    

Section 27-698
--------------

Section 27-698 ::    
        
     
        §  27-698  Where  more than one pile type, pile capacity, or method of
      pile installation is used. Wherever it is proposed to: (1)  construct  a
      foundation  for  a  building  utilizing  piles  of more than one type or
      capacity; (2) modify an existing foundation by the addition of piles  of
      a  type  or  capacity  other  than  those  of  the  existing piling; (3)
      construct or modify a foundation utilizing  different  methods  or  more
      than  one method of installation, or using different types or capacities
      of equipment  (such  as  different  types  of  hammers  having  markedly
      different  striking  energies  or  speeds);  or  (4)  support  part of a
      building on piles and  part  on  footings,  the  several  parts  of  the
      building  supported  on  the  different  types,  capacities, or modes of
      piling shall be separated by suitable joints providing for  differential
      movement,  or  a  report shall be submitted by the architect or engineer
      establishing to the satisfaction of the commissioner that  the  proposed
      construction  is  adequate  and  safe,  and  showing  that  the probable
      settlements and differential settlements to be expected will not  result
      in instability of the building or stresses in the structure in excess of
      the  allowable values established in subchapter ten of this chapter. The
      provisions of subdivision (d) of section 27-700 of article eight of this
      subchapter relating to required load tests shall  apply  separately  and
      distinctly  to  each  different  type  or  capacity of piling, method of
      installation, or type  or  capacity  of  equipment  used,  except  where
      analysis of the probable, comparative behavior of the different types or
      capacities  of  the  piles or the methods of installation indicates that
      data on one type or capacity of pile permits a reliable extrapolation of
      the probable behavior of the piles of other types and capacities.
