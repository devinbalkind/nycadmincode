        ยง 27-662 General. Borings in earth or rock, recovery of samples, tests
      of  soil  samples,  load  tests,  or other investigations or exploratory
      procedures  shall  be  performed  as  necessary  for  the   design   and
      construction  of  a  safe foundation subject to inspection in accordance
      with the requirements of article thirteen of this subchapter.

Section 27-663 ::    
        
     
        ยง  27-663  Borings.  (a) Number. At least one boring shall be made for
      every twenty-five hundred square  feet  of  building  area  or  fraction
      thereof  and, for buildings supported on piling of such type or capacity
      that load tests are required, one boring shall be made for every sixteen
      hundred square feet of building  area  or  fraction  thereof  except  as
      indicated in paragraphs one through three of this subdivision.
        (1)  For one- and two-family dwellings (appurtenant structures such as
      garages,  sheds,  and  porches  shall  be  considered  as  part  of  the
      dwelling):
        a.  Buildings  supported  on footings founded on soil of class 8-65 or
      better--For contiguous groups of four or more  dwellings  at  least  one
      boring  shall  be  made for every four buildings. For isolated dwellings
      and for contiguous groups of two or three dwellings,  the  overall  site
      shall  be  explored  by  at  least  one  boring  or  auger  probing  or,
      alternately, the site of each building shall be explored by one test pit
      carried to a depth of at least eight feet below the level of the  bottom
      of the proposed footings.
        b.  Buildings supported on piles or on footings founded in soil strata
      of class 9-65, or poorer--The site shall be explored  by  at  least  one
      boring  for  every four buildings in contiguous groups or one boring for
      each building in the case of isolated dwellings.
        (2) For buildings having a plan area in excess of ten thousand  square
      feet  and  where  subsurface  conditions  as determined from preliminary
      borings or from borings on neighboring sites consist of uniform deposits
      of materials of class 1-65, 2-65, 3-65, 6-65, 7-65, or 8-65, subject  to
      the approval of the commissioner, the required borings may be reduced to
      one  for  every  five  thousand square feet of building area or fraction
      thereof except where the foundation is to be supported on piles.
        (3) Where foundations are to rest on rock of class 1-65, 2-65, or 3-65
      and such rock is exposed prior to construction over a part or all of the
      area of the buildings, borings will not be required in those areas where
      rock is exposed, and the area (within the limits of the building) of the
      exposed rock surface shall not be included in the area used  to  compute
      the  required number of borings, provided the following requirements are
      met:
        a. The presence of defects or the inclination of bedding planes in the
      rock are of such size and location as to not affect the stability of the
      foundation.
        b. The foundation is designed  for  bearing  pressures  not  exceeding
      those permitted in table 11-2 without increase for embedment.
        (b)  Location.  At  least two-thirds of the required number of borings
      shall be located within the area under the building. Those  outside  the
      area  shall  not  be  more  than twenty-five feet from the limits of the
      building. Borings shall  be  uniformly  distributed  or  distributed  in
      accordance with the loading pattern imposed by the building.
        (c)  Depth.  (1)  Unless  soil  material of class 1-65 through 3-65 is
      encountered at shallower depth, borings shall extend below  the  deepest
      part  of  the excavation as necessary to satisfy the more restrictive of
      the following requirements:
        a. Borings  shall  extend  deep  enough  into  nominally  satisfactory
      bearing  material to establish its character and thickness, but not less
      than the following:
        1. Where the soil material is class 5-65--ten feet.
        2. For one and two family residences, two stories or less in  height--
      fifteen feet.
        3. For other cases-- twenty-five feet.
        b.  Borings  shall  extend  to  the depth at which the vertical stress
      caused by the proposed construction is reduced to ten percent or less of
    
      the original vertical stress at this depth due  to  the  weight  of  the
      overburden,  except that where strata of soil materials of class 9-65 or
      poorer are encountered within this depth, the  borings  shall  penetrate
      such  strata and be carried to a depth that shows penetration continuous
      of material of class 8-65 or better as required in paragraph a  of  this
      subdivision.
        c.  In  addition  to  the  requirements  of paragraphs a and b of this
      subdivision, at least one boring in every ten thousand  square  feet  of
      building  area,  but  not  less  than  one boring per building, shall be
      carried to a depth of one hundred feet  below  the  curb  for  buildings
      having an average area load exceeding one thousand psf. The average load
      shall  be  computed  as  the sum of all dead loads and live loads of the
      building, divided by the area of the building at ground level.
        (2) Where rock is encountered in borings within the  depths  noted  in
      paragraph  one  the  borings  shall be cored a minimum of five feet into
      rock, or farther where necessary or  required,  to  obtain  at  least  a
      recovery  of thirty-five per cent core from five feet of penetration but
      not to exceed the depth in paragraph one of this  subdivision.  However,
      for foundations supported on piles or drilled-in caissons bearing on the
      rock  and  having  a  capacity  in  excess  of eighty tons per unit, the
      capacity of the rock to support the applied load shall  be  demonstrated
      by increasing the length of coring to ten feet.
        (d) Types.
        (1)  SOIL BORINGS. Soil samples shall be recovered at intervals not to
      exceed five feet and at every change of soil strata. Such samples  shall
      be  recovered using a two inch O.D. split spoon sampler having an inside
      diameter of one and three-eighths inches and a constant  internal  cross
      section. The sampler shall be at least twenty-four inches long and shall
      be  tipped with a heat treated, sharp cutting shoe. It shall be straight
      and sound, with an undistorted cross section.  The  rods  to  which  the
      sampler  is  attached  shall  be  one  inch  extra heavy pipe or one and
      five-eighths O.D. drill rods. The sampling tools shall be driven with  a
      one hundred forty pound hammer having a fall of thirty inches. The blows
      per foot so recorded shall be designated, hereinafter, by the symbol, N.
      The  fall  of  the  hammer shall be a free fall and the energy of impact
      shall not be mitigated by friction of the hoisting  line  on  the  drum,
      friction  of the hammer against its guide, or other similar effects. All
      samples, except those of rock, shall be preserved in air  tight  bottles
      having a capacity of at least eight ounces.
        (2)  ROCK  BORINGS.  Where borings are required to penetrate rock they
      shall be advanced by core drilling, and core samples shall be  recovered
      using  a  double tube core barrel and diamond bits that provide cores at
      least one and three-eighths inches in diameter.
        (e) Data to be reported.  Records  of  all  borings  required  by  the
      provisions  of  subdivision  (a)  of  this  section  shall accompany the
      application for approval of the foundation  plans.  Such  records  shall
      show,  as a minimum, the size of casing and the number of blows per foot
      required to advance the casing (to the depth that casing is  used);  the
      weight of hammer and the distance of fall; a description of the sampler;
      a  description  of  the drill tools and equipment including, where used,
      the size of diamond bits and type of core barrels; the number  of  blows
      required  to  drive  the sampling spoon for each six inches increment of
      penetration; the elevation  of  the  ground  surface  referenced  to  an
      established datum; the location and depth of the boring and its relation
      to  the  proposed  construction;  the  elevations  at which samples were
      taken; the elevations at which core drilling was started and stopped for
      each "run"; the elevations of the boundaries  of  soil  strata;  percent
      recovery for each "run" of core drilling; description of the soil strata
    
      encountered  and  geological  classification  of  rock drilled (based on
      visual examination  of  cores);  any  particular,  unusual,  or  special
      conditions such as loss of water in the earth and rock strata, boulders,
      cavities,  and  obstructions,  use  of  special type of samplers, traps,
      etc.; and the level of ground water together with a description  of  how
      and  when  the  ground  water  level  was  observed.  All  abandoned  or
      unsuccessful attempts at borings or rock drilling shall be reported.
        (f) Disposition of samples and cores.  Soil  samples  and  rock  cores
      shall  be  retained  in  an  accessible location by the owner, or by the
      party making application for approval of  the  foundation  plans  for  a
      period  of  one  year  after  the  date  of issuance of a certificate of
      occupancy, and shall be available upon reasonable notice for  inspection
      by the commissioner.

Section 27-664 ::    
        
     
        ยง  27-664  Test pits. (a) Test pits may be substituted for boring on a
      one-for-one basis. All applicable requirements as to depth,  numbers  of
      samples,  data  to  be  reported,  and  disposition  of samples shall be
      observed, except that the use of  sample  spoon,  recording  of  driving
      resistance,  and  recovery  of  rock  cores  is not required in test pit
      investigations, and except  as  provided  in  subdivision  (b)  of  this
      section.
        (b)  Test  pits for buildings not more than one story in height or for
      one or two-family residences not more than two stories  in  height  need
      only  extend  four feet below the deepest part of the excavation for the
      construction of footings, or a minimum  of  four  feet  when  foundation
      elements  rest on grade pursuant to paragraph four of subdivision (a) of
      section 27-658 of article one of this  subchapter,  provided  that  such
      structures  are  supported by footings bearing on nominally satisfactory
      bearing materials of class 9-65 (except soft clay) soil or better.
    
    
    
    
    
    
    

Section 27-665
--------------

Section 27-665 ::    
        
     
        ยง  27-665  Boring methods. Borings shall be made by continuous driving
      and cleaning out of a pipe  casing  (including  telescoping  of  smaller
      sizes  inside of larger casing) except as permitted in subdivisions (a),
      (b), and (c) of this section. Where casing is used, it shall be  cleaned
      out  to  undisturbed  soil prior to sampling and the sample spoon driven
      into  soil  that  has  not  been  affected  by  chopping,  washing,   or
      hydrostatic imbalance.
        (a)  Uncased  borings.  Uncased  borings,  including borings where the
      casing is omitted for part of the depth, may be used if the  mud  slurry
      method  is  followed. The requirements for soil sampling and rock coring
      shall be the same for uncased borings as for borings made using  casing,
      except  that  prior  to each soil sampling operation the boring shall be
      substantially cleaned of disturbed material and the sample  spoon  shall
      be  advanced  through  any  settled  solids  before  counting  the blows
      required to drive the spoon.  Longer  sample  spoons,  having  a  sludge
      chamber,  shall  be  used  where  settled  solids  exceed  six inches In
      determining ground water levels, methods shall be  used  to  reduce  and
      replace the mud slurry so that the hydrostatic head may be measured. The
      procedures shall be described in detail in the records.
        (b)  Auger  borings. Borings may be made with augers except that short
      flight augers shall not be used in granular soils below the water level.
      Sampling procedures in auger borings for both soil and rock shall be the
      same as for cased borings. Full hydrostatic head shall be maintained  in
      granular soils below the ground water level during the boring operation.
        (c)  Maximum  diameter. Where the bore hole, as drilled by any method,
      is in excess of four inches in diameter, sampling  operations  shall  be
      performed  through a temporary casing having a four inch inside diameter
      or less.
    
    
    
    
    
    
    

Section 27-666
--------------

Section 27-666 ::    
        
     
        ยง  27-666 Probings and geophysical explorations. (a) Footings, pier or
      wall designs. Where the foundations for a proposed building  consist  of
      footings  or  foundation  piers  or walls bearing on rock of class 1-65,
      2-65 or 3-65, the use of probings, auger borings or geophysical methods,
      made without the recovery of soil samples or rock cores, may (except  as
      hereafter  specified) be substituted for up to one-half of the number of
      borings required by the provisions of subdivision (a) of section  27-663
      of  this article, provided that such probings, borings, etc. are carried
      to adequate depth and are of a nature that will  reasonably  define  the
      surface  contours  of  the  rock.  The  accuracy of such surface contour
      definition shall be confirmed by recovering rock cores at the  locations
      of  at  least one-fifth of the probings or auger borings or, in the case
      where geophysical methods are used, those borings which are  made  shall
      be  so  distributed  as  to  permit  confirmation of the accuracy of the
      geophysical  investigations.  The  provisions  of   paragraph   two   of
      subdivision (a) of section 27-663 of this article, shall not apply where
      the provisions of this section are invoked.
        (b)  Pile  support.  Where  the  foundation  for the proposed building
      consists of piling bearing on rock of class  1-65,  2-65  or  3-65,  the
      provisions of subdivision (a) of this section shall apply, provided that
      the  borings consistently show that the soil overlying the rock consists
      solely of deposits of class 6-65 through 11-65 and is free  of  boulders
      or other obstructions.
        (c) Geophysical methods. Geophysical investigations shall be conducted
      by  experienced  and  qualified personnel acceptable to the commissioner
      who may reject the results and require additional exploration by borings
      if the results of the geophysical explorations cannot be  satisfactorily
      correlated to the logs of the borings.

Section 27-667 ::    
        
     
        ยง  27-667  Existing  borings.  Existing  boring  data  may be utilized
      subject to the following:
        (1) Borings, test  pits,  probings,  etc.,  that  have  been  made  in
      accordance  with  all  requirements of this section, but not necessarily
      for the investigation of the specific project for which  application  is
      being made, may be utilized in fulfillment of these provisions.
        (2)  The  logs  of  borings, test pits, probings, etc., that have been
      made in accordance with all requirements of this  section,  but  wherein
      the  soil  samples  and/or rock cores are not available for examination,
      may be utilized in fulfillment of these provisions to an extent  not  to
      exceed one-half of the required number of borings.
        (3)  Borings,  test pits, probings, etc., or the logs thereof, that do
      not meet the specific requirements of this subchapter, but which are  of
      suitable  type and adequate penetration to provide the data required for
      the safe design and construction of  the  proposed  foundation,  may  be
      utilized  in  fulfillment  of the provisions of this section, subject to
      the approval of the commissioner.
