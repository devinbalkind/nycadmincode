Section 27-657
--------------

Section 27-657 ::    
        
     
        §  27-657  General  requirements.  Except  as  otherwise  specifically
      provided herein, the foundations of buildings including retaining  walls
      and  other structures shall bear on, or be carried down to, satisfactory
      bearing materials in such manner that the entire transmitted  load  will
      be  distributed  over  the  supporting  soils  at  any depth beneath the
      foundation at unit  intensities  within  the  allowable  bearing  values
      established  in  this  subchapter.  In  addition,  foundations  shall be
      proportioned to limit settlements to a magnitude  that  will  not  cause
      damage  to  the  proposed construction or to existing adjacent or nearby
      buildings during or after construction.
    
    
    
    
    
    
    

Section 27-658
--------------

Section 27-658 ::    
        
     
        §  27-658 Depth of foundations. (a) Footings and Pile Caps. The bottom
      surface  of  any  footing,  pier,  pile   cap,   or   other   foundation
      construction,  other  than  grade  beams, shall be carried down at least
      four feet below the lowest level of the  adjoining  ground  or  pavement
      surface that is exposed to frost, except as follows:
        (1)  In  refrigerator, cold storage, or similar areas, the depth shall
      be increased as required to found the construction below  the  potential
      level  of  freezing  in the soil, or loss of heat from the soil shall be
      prevented  by  insulation,  warm  air  ducts,  circulating  systems,  or
      equivalent means.
        (2)  For foundation elements resting on rock, the footings may rest on
      the rock  surface  at  shallower  depths  than  those  indicated  above,
      provided  that visual inspection of the rock surface directly underlying
      the bearing area shows it to be free of seams, cracks, or  disintegrated
      materials  that  could serve as reservoirs for water and thus be subject
      to freezing.
        (3) For foundation elements in  the  interior  of  closed  and  heated
      buildings,  or  in cases where the soil underlying the foundation is not
      subject to frost action, there shall be no mandatory minimum requirement
      for embedment.
        (4) Mobile or portable buildings not more than one story high  may  be
      supported  on  foundation  elements  bearing  at  grade,  subject to the
      following conditions:
        a. The building shall be supported on jacks, wedges, or other  devices
      that will permit readjustment of level in the event of displacement.
        b.  The  bearing  capacity of the underlying soil shall be adequate to
      support the building loads without rupture. Where the building is to  be
      supported  on nominally unsatisfactory bearing materials, the provisions
      of sections 27-677 and 27-679 of article four of this  subchapter  shall
      apply except that, where the bearing material is confined under pavement
      and  the  bearing  pressure on the surface of the soil material does not
      exceed five hundred psf, special investigation of  the  foundation  will
      not be required.
        c.  The  bearing  area  shall  be  well  drained  and  not  subject to
      inundation.
        d. The levels of the foundations shall  be  checked  and  adjusted  to
      compensate  for  displacements  at  least once every year, and the owner
      shall maintain a record of such work, available for  inspection  by  the
      commissioner.
        (5)  Where  piles project above grade and displacement of the pile cap
      is prevented by interposing a space between the underside of the cap and
      the ground, the requirement for embedment of the cap below the level  of
      frost penetration shall not apply.
        (b) Grade beams. The bottom surface of any grade beam shall be carried
      down  at  least  eighteen inches below the lowest level of the adjoining
      ground or pavement surface that is exposed to frost.
    
    
    
    
    
    
    

Section 27-659
--------------

Section 27-659 ::    
        
     
        § 27-659 Foundations at different levels. Where footings are supported
      at  different  levels,  or  at  different  levels  from  the footings of
      adjacent structures, the influence of the  pressures  under  the  higher
      footings  on  the  stability  of the lower footings shall be considered.
      Consideration shall be given to the requirements for lateral support  of
      the material supporting the higher footings, the additional load imposed
      on  the  lower  footings,  and  assessment of the effects of dragdown on
      adjacent pile-supported buildings.
    
    
    
    
    
    
    

Section 27-660
--------------

Section 27-660 ::    
        
     
        §  27-660  Slabs  on  grade.  Slabs  on  grade within or adjacent to a
      building shall be so designed to limit settlement of  such  slabs  to  a
      magnitude  that  will  not impair their usability or cause damage to the
      building or its foundations.
    
    
    
    
    
    
    

Section 27-661
--------------

Section 27-661 ::    
        
     
        §  27-661  Construction. The provisions of subchapter nineteen of this
      chapter relating to  safety  and  of  subchapter  ten  of  this  chapter
      relating  to  concrete,  timber,  masonry,  and steel construction shall
      apply.  For  inspection  requirements,  see  article  thirteen  of  this
      subchapter.
        (a)  Cold  weather.  No  foundation shall be placed on frozen soil. No
      foundation shall be placed in freezing weather unless provision is  made
      to maintain the underlying soil free of frost.
        (b)  Seepage.  In an excavation where soil and ground water conditions
      are such that an inward or upward seepage  might  be  produced  in  soil
      material  intended to provide vertical or lateral support for foundation
      elements or for  adjacent  foundations,  excavating  methods  that  will
      control  or  prevent  the  inflow  of  ground water shall be employed to
      prevent disturbance of the soil material in the  excavation  or  beneath
      existing  buildings.  No  foundation shall be laid on soil that has been
      disturbed by  seepage  unless  remedial  measures,  as  directed  by  an
      architect or engineer, are taken.
