        ยง  27-779  Required  ventilating  systems.  The  following  tests  and
      inspection requirements shall be complied with in  order  to  obtain  an
      equipment use permit for a required ventilating system.
        (a)  Procedure.  A required ventilating system shall be subject to the
      requirements for controlled inspection as provided in article  eight  of
      subchapter one of this chapter except that it shall not be required that
      the  architect  or  engineer  be  in  the  employ  of  the  owner.  Such
      requirements shall include (1) a controlled inspection  to  verify  that
      the  installation  and operation of the completed system comply with the
      requirements of this subchapter, comprising tests to ascertain that  the
      amount  of  air being supplied to and exhausted from each space conforms
      with the requirements of this code, and tests that  all  required  smoke
      detection  and fire protection devices are functioning properly; and (2)
      a controlled inspection comprising tests to verify  that  required  fire
      dampers  are  installed  and  functioning  properly  as  provided for in
      subdivision (d)  of  section  27-343  of  this  code.  When  a  required
      ventilating  system  handles  five  thousand  cfm  or  less, it shall be
      subject to controlled inspection  except  that  the  person  making  the
      inspection  may be an architect, engineer or a person with at least five
      years of experience installing ventilating systems. However, if  such  a
      system exhausts any of the following:
        (1) fumes, dusts, vapors or other noxious or injurious substances,
        (2) substances that create a fire hazard,
        then  the  person  making  the  inspection  shall  be  an architect or
      engineer.  It shall not be required that the architect or engineer be in
      the employ of the owner. The test reports required under the  provisions
      of article eight of subchapter one of this chapter shall be filed in the
      form prescribed by the commissioner. The form shall include the quantity
      of air supplied or exhausted by each outlet.
        (b) Fire extinguishing systems. No equipment use permit for a required
      ventilating system containing a required fire extinguishing system shall
      be   issued   until   a  signed  statement  has  been  obtained  from  a
      representative of the fire commissioner who has witnessed  the  test  of
      the  extinguishing  system  and its control devices, certifying the fire
      commissioner's acceptance of such a system.
        (c)  Owner's  statement.  A  statement  shall  be   filed   with   the
      commissioner  by  the  owner or lessee of the building that the required
      ventilating system will be kept in continuous  operation  at  all  times
      during the occupancy of the building and, if any smoke or fire detection
      devices  or  fire  extinguishing systems have been installed, that he or
      she will have such devices and the fan shut-offs actuated by them tested
      and inspected by a competent person or agency at one year  intervals  or
      less.  The owner or lessee shall also state that he or she will promptly
      make any necessary adjustments  and  repairs  to  keep  the  ventilating
      system and its safety devices in proper operating condition. A record of
      each  inspection  and  test  shall  be maintained on the premises by the
      owner or lessee, and records for at least the last two  years  shall  be
      made   available  for  inspection  by  the  commissioner  and  the  fire
      commissioner.

      ventilating system or other air duct system when smoke detectors or fire
      protection devices are required.
        (a)  Procedure.  A voluntary ventilating system or other voluntary air
      duct system shall be subject to test and inspection  to  ascertain  that
