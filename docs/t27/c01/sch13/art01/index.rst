      occupies  less  than  twenty  per cent of the floor area occupied by the
      principal use.
        (2)   Ventilation   systems   supplying   corridors   shall   not   be
      interconnected  with  systems  serving  other  spaces,  except that this

      dedicated fan equipment or the building ventilation system  arranged  to
      shut  down  automatically with manual override capability to exhaust one
      floor at a time through a roof or an approved location  on  an  exterior

      closing all  openings  between  the  corridor  and  sleeping  room  with
      construction  having  a fire-resistance rating equal to the construction
      in which the opening occurs. When continued use of corridor spaces as  a
      plenum  is  permitted,  smoke  detecting  devices  shall be installed in
      accordance with the requirements of section 27-981  of  article  six  of
