        (b) Light gauge cold formed steel. Reference standard RS 10-6.
        (c)   Open   web   steel  joists.  Reference  standard  RS  10-7.  The
      commissioner  shall  amend  RS  10-7  to  establish  minimum  acceptable
      fireproofing  methods  for  open  web  steel  joists and to redefine the

Section 27-615 ::    
        
     
        ยง  27-615  Identification. Structural steel that is required to have a
      minimum yield point greater than thirty-six thousand psi  shall  at  all
      times  in  the  fabricator's  plant, be marked, segregated, or otherwise
      handled  so  that  the  separate  alloys  and  tempers  are   positively
      identified,  and  after  completion  of  fabrication, shall be marked to
      identify the alloy  and  temper.  Such  markings  shall  be  affixed  to
      completed  members  and  assemblies  or to boxed or bundled shipments of
      multiple units prior to shipment from the fabricator's plant.  Open  web
      steel  joists  shall  have identification affixed to each bundle or lift

        (2) Where manual welding work is not performed  in  the  city  of  New
      York,  welds  shall be made by welders qualified under the provisions of
      appendix D, parts II and III, of the AWS code for  welding  in  building
      construction.  Qualification with any of the steels permitted by the AWS
      code shall be considered as qualification  to  weld  any  of  the  other
      steels permitted by the code.
        (3)  Tack  welds,  which  are  later  incorporated into finished welds
      carrying calculated stress, shall not be considered as structural welds.
        (4) The inspection of welding  operations  stipulated  in  table  10-2
      shall include a check to ascertain that the welders employed on the work
      have  the  required  license  or  who  are  qualified in accordance with
      paragraph two of this subdivision.
