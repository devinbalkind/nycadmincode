Article 10 - THIN SHELL AND FOLDED-PLATE CONSTRUCTION
=====================================================

Section 27-632
--------------

Section 27-632 ::    
        
     
        ยง   27-632   General   requirements.   Thin   shell  and  folded-plate
      construction may be used for buildings  or  portions  of  buildings,  as
      required  in  this  section  and  subject  to  the  provisions  of  this
      subchapter. The applicable provisions of the several reference standards
      relating to allowable stresses and the use of structural materials shall
      apply except as modified in this section.
    
    
    
    
    
    
    

Section 27-633
--------------

Section 27-633 ::    
        
     
        ยง 27-633 Analysis. (1) Unless otherwise permitted by the commissioner,
      stresses,  displacements,  and  stability of thin shell and folded-plate
      structures shall be determined on the basis of the assumption of elastic
      behavior. The shell or plate  may  be  assumed  to  be  homogeneous  and
      isotropic.
        (2) The analysis for stability shall consider large deflections, creep
      effects  and  the  deviation  between  the  actual and theoretical shell
      surface.
    
    
    
    
    
    
    

Section 27-634
--------------

Section 27-634 ::    
        
     
        ยง 27-634 Thin concrete shells. The provisions of sections 403, 404 and
      405  of  reference  standard  RS  10-45  shall  apply with the following
      modifications. The remaining sections of  reference  standard  RS  10-45
      shall not apply.
        (1)  The  advisory  provisions of this standard shall be considered as
      mandatory.
        (2) The minimum ultimate strength of concrete for thin shells shall be
      three thousand psi.
        (3) Change all references to  "the  building  code  (ACI  318-63)"  to
      "reference standard RS 10-4".
