=============================================

Section 27-596

Section 27-596 ::    
        
     
        ยง  27-596 General. The structural design of a member or assembly shall
      be  deemed  to  be  adequate  if  the  design  computations  demonstrate
      conformance with the applicable standards noted in articles four through
      twelve  of  this  subchapter.  Where, because of practical difficulties,
      such computations cannot be  executed,  the  structural  design  may  be
      deemed  adequate  if  the  member  or  assembly  is  subjected  to,  and
      satisfactorily  performs  under,  load  tests  in  accordance  with  the
      provisions  of  subdivision (a) of section 27-599 of this article. Where
      there is a question  as  to  the  adequacy  of  a  completed  or  partly
      completed  construction,  the provisions of sections 27-597, 27-598, and
      subdivision (b) of section 27-599 of this article shall apply.
    
    
    
    
    
    
    

Section 27-597
--------------

Section 27-597 ::    
        
     
        ยง  27-597  Questionable construction. If, upon inspection, it is found
      that a construction or any part thereof, as built,  shows  open  cracks,
      spallings, or other signs of distress; or should inspection records show
      more  significant deficiency of construction; or should laboratory tests
      on concrete or other materials that have been incorporated into the work
      indicate deficiency of strength; or should there be a  reasonable  doubt
      as  to  the  strength, stability, or adequacy of the construction or any
      part thereof, such construction may be checked to  verify  the  adequacy
      thereof  either  by  computation,  or by core or load tests conducted in
      accordance with the provisions of section 27-598 or subdivision  (b)  of
      section  27-599  of  this  article or by any combination of these means.
      Should the adequacy of construction not be verified within a  reasonable
      time,  such  construction  shall  be rejected and shall be demolished or
      reinforced  or  rebuilt  to  be  made  safe  in  conformance  with   the
      requirements  of  this  code.  In the event of a disagreement, the final
      decision as to  the  acceptance  of  the  work  shall  be  made  by  the
      commissioner. All such tests shall be made without expense to the city.
    
    
    
    
    
    
    

Section 27-598
--------------

Section 27-598 ::    
        
     
        ยง  27-598  Core  tests  of  concrete construction. The adequacy of the
      concrete in a building may be ascertained by the recovery and testing of
      cores. Cores shall be taken and tested in accordance with the  procedure
      described  in  reference  standard  RS  10-16.  In  lieu  thereof, cores
      cast-in-place and originally cured with the parent  concrete,  or  other
      device acceptable to the architect or engineer designated for controlled
      inspection   and  which  will  produce  test  specimens  simulating  the
      condition of the concrete in place including the  size  and  proportions
      specified for core specimens may be utilized to demonstrate the adequacy
      of  the  concrete in place. The compressive strength so determined shall
      meet the requirements for  strength  tests  as  described  in  reference
      standard RS 10-3.
    
    
    
    
    
    
    

Section 27-599
--------------

Section 27-599 ::    
        
     
        ยง  27-599  Load tests. (a) Prequalifying load tests. The provisions of
      this section shall apply only to load tests  made  for  the  purpose  of
      establishing  the  structural  adequacy  of members or assemblies before
      such members or assemblies are incorporated into the  work.  Load  tests
      for  the purpose of establishing the strength of an element or assembly,
      in place, after construction,  shall  conform  to  the  requirements  of
      subdivision (b) of this section.
        (1)  TEST SPECIMENS. The test specimens shall be a true representation
      of the units or assemblies to be used in the work and, unless sufficient
      tests  are  conducted  on  differing  specimens   to   interpolate   the
      performance  of members of varying characteristics, test specimens shall
      be substantially identical with the units or assemblies to  be  used  in
      service.  Particular  attention  shall be given to matching the type and
      grade of material and, in the case of concrete, the  mix,  age,  curing,
      and other pertinent variables.
        (2)  SUPPORT CONDITIONS AND INTERACTION. Load tests shall be performed
      in such a manner that the supports for the members or  assemblies  being
      tested  will  simulate the conditions of support in the building, except
      that conditions of partial fixity may be approximated  by  condition  of
      full  or  zero  restraint,  whichever  produces  a  more  severe  stress
      condition in the member being tested. The test conditions shall be  such
      as  to obviate all interaction of fills, finishes, partitions, supports,
      or members whose interaction normally  would  be  neglected  in  design.
      Where  continuous, multiple, intersecting, or connected members are used
      in the test, all interacting members shall be simultaneously  and  fully
      loaded and additional tests shall be performed under the partial loading
      conditions  specified in subchapter nine of this chapter. Test specimens
      shall not be unloaded and reloaded or  subjected  to  cyclical  loading,
      except  as  specifically  required  by  the  provisions of this code and
      except that the adding of increments of  additional  load  to  a  member
      already  under load and the application of the test load as described in
      subparagraph b of paragraph three of this subdivision following  removal
      of  the test load described in subparagraph a of paragraph three of this
      subdivision will be permitted.
        (3) STRENGTH  REQUIREMENTS.  The  member  or  assembly,  supported  as
      described  in  paragraph  two  of  this subdivision, shall be capable of
      supporting:
        a. Without visible damage (other than hairline cracks) its own  weight
      plus  a test load equal to one hundred fifty per cent of the design live
      load plus one hundred fifty per cent of any dead load that will be added
      at the site; and
        b. Without collapse, its own weight plus a test load  equal  to  fifty
      per cent of its own weight plus two hundred fifty per cent of the design
      live  load plus two hundred fifty per cent of any dead load that will be
      added at the site. The latter  loading  shall  remain  in  place  for  a
      minimum  period  of  one  week.  All  loading  conditions  described  in
      subchapter nine of this chapter shall be  considered.  The  design  live
      load  shall  be  the  nominal  value  reduced  for  contributory area as
      described in subchapter nine. Except as permitted under  paragraph  five
      of this subdivision, units to be tested shall be full size. Load bearing
      wall  and  partition  assemblies  shall  be tested both with and without
      window and door framing where such framing will be included in the final
      assemblies.
        Exception. If the load tests are conducted and the results promulgated
      in a manner that will permit clear differentiation between the dead  and
      live  load components added at the site, then the capacity of the member
      or assembly  without  visible  damage  other  than  hairline  cracks  as
      determined  under  load  test  condition  in subparagraph a of paragraph
    
      three of this subdivision, may be reduced to the weight of  the  member,
      plus  any  dead  load  that  will be added at the site, plus one hundred
      fifty per cent of the design live load; and the capacity of  the  member
      or  assembly  to resist collapse as determined under load test condition
      in subparagraph b of paragraph three of this subdivision may be  reduced
      to  one  hundred  fifty  per  cent of the weight of the member, plus one
      hundred fifty per cent of any dead load that will be added at the  site,
      plus two hundred fifty per cent of the design live load.
        (4)  DEFLECTION  REQUIREMENT. With the member or assembly supported as
      described in paragraph two of this subdivision,  and  after  loading  as
      required  by the provisions of subparagraph a of paragraph three of this
      subdivision and the removal of said load, the percentage of recovery  of
      the  deflection  caused  by  the  superimposed  load  shall  be at least
      seventy-five per cent. The deflection under the design live  load  shall
      not exceed that permitted in this subchapter.
        (5)  MODEL  TESTS.  Tests on models less than full size may be used to
      determine  the  relative  intensity,  direction,  and  distribution   of
      stresses  and  applied  loads,  but  shall not be considered as a proper
      method for evaluating stresses  in,  nor  the  strength  of,  individual
      members  unless  approved  by  the  commissioner for this purpose. Where
      model analysis is proposed as a means  of  establishing  the  structural
      design, the following conditions shall be met:
        a.  Analysis  shall be made by a firm or a corporation satisfactory to
      the commissioner.
        b. The similitude, scaling, and validity  of  the  analysis  shall  be
      attested to by an officer or principal of the firm or corporation making
      the analysis.
        c.  A  report on the analysis shall be submitted showing test set-ups,
      equipment, and readings.
        (b) Load tests of  completed  construction.  The  provisions  of  this
      subdivision   shall   apply  to  any  type  of  construction  where  the
      appropriate reference  standard  does  not  provide  for  load  test  of
      completed  construction  and  the construction is questionable. When the
      appropriate reference standard  provides  for  such  load  testing,  the
      provisions of reference standard shall be used.
        (1) Strength. The construction shall be loaded in two stages:
        (a) With all dead load to which it will be subjected in service plus a
      superimposed  load equal to the design live load reduced as described in
      subchapter nine of this chapter; and
        (b) With a total load, including its own weight, equal to one  hundred
      fifty  per  cent  of the total dead load to be supported in service plus
      one hundred eighty per  cent  of  the  design  live  load,  reduced  for
      contributory area as described in subchapter nine of this chapter, which
      load shall remain in place for a minimum period of twenty-four hours.
        (2)  Deflection  requirement.  Under  the  first  stage  loading,  the
      deflection shall not exceed that permitted in the  applicable  reference
      standard.  The  residual  deflection  after  removal of the second stage
      loading shall not exceed twenty-five per cent of the calculated  elastic
      deflection  under  the  superimposed  test  load.  The  structure, after
      recovery of the deflection  shall  not  show  any  evidence  of  serious
      distress.
        (3)  Interaction. The load area shall extend to include the loading of
      all framing and elements that contribute to the strength of the  element
      or elements under test, by way of interaction.
        (4)  Lateral loads. Where the elements in question must resist lateral
      loads in service, such loads shall be simulated in the  tests.  In  such
      case, the magnitude of the applied live load and lateral load components
      of  the  test  load  may  be  adjusted as described in section 27-594 of
    
      article two of this subchapter, provided that the stress condition under
      the load increments described in paragraph one of  this  subdivision  is
      not more critical.
        (5)  Reloading.  Unloading  and  reloading or cyclical loading of test
      areas will not be permitted, except for the addition  of  increments  of
      additional load to a member already under load.
