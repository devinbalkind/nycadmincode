Section 27-585 ::    
        
     
        §  27-585  General  requirements.  For  purposes  of  this  code,  the
      structural elements of a building  shall  normally  include  all  floor,
      roof,   and   wall   framing   members  and  slabs  (but  not  including
      slabs-on-grade); all piers, walls, footings, piles, and similar elements
      of the foundation;  and  all  other  elements  of  both  foundation  and
      superstructure  which,  in engineering practice, are proportioned on the
      basis of calculated stress. Where doubt  exists  as  to  the  structural
      nature  of  an  element,  the  provisions  of  this  subchapter,  and of
      subchapter eleven of this chapter, shall be deemed to apply only  to  an
      element  in  which  the materials are stressed in excess of thirty-three
      and one-third per cent of the allowable stress values (without  increase
      for infrequent stress conditions) for such material in its proposed use,
      or to an element wherein public safety would be involved in the event of
      excessive distortion under the applied loads.

      of construction used in the manufacture and/or placement  of  structural
      elements  in  a building shall be subject to the requirements of article
      seven of subchapter one  of  this  chapter,  the  inspection  provisions
      established  in  tables  10-1  and 10-2 and the detailed requirements of
      articles four through twelve of this subchapter and article thirteen  of

        §  27-587  Fire  protection requirements to apply. Where a material or
      method of construction in a specific use is  required  to  provide  fire
      protection  as  well  as  structural adequacy, the material or method of
      construction shall meet both specified requirements.
    
    
    
    
    
    
    

Section 27-588
--------------

Section 27-588 ::    
        
     
        §  27-588  Use  of used and unidentified materials. The utilization of
      used materials and unidentified or ungraded materials shall  be  limited
      to non-structural elements, except:
        (a)  Such  materials (or elements) may be reused, or continued in use,
      at stress levels to which the materials or elements  were  subjected  in
      the  previous  construction, or at load capacity as demonstrated by load
      test procedures as described in subdivision (a)  of  section  27-599  of
      article three of this subchapter.
        (b)  Unidentified  materials may be graded by the recovery and test of
      representative  samples,  or  by  other  means   satisfactory   to   the
      commissioner.
        (c) Used materials shall be considered to be graded where the grade is
      clearly  indicated  on  the approved plans for the existing construction
      and may be used at the allowable stress levels for that  grade  of  like
      material  as  established  in the building code in force at the time the
      plans for the existing construction were approved.

        §  27-589  Equivalent  systems  of  design. Nothing in this subchapter
      shall be construed  to  prohibit  the  use  of  any  system  of  design,
      alternate  to  those  indicated, provided that it can be demonstrated to
      the satisfaction of the commissioner that such  system  of  design  will
      provide  a  factor  of safety against structural failure consistent with
      the requirements of articles four through  twelve  of  this  subchapter,
      fire  safety  in  consonance  with the requirements of subchapters three
      through eight of this chapter, and such other characteristics  pertinent
      to  the  safety  of  life,  health,  and  property as prescribed in this
      subchapter or as may be required by the commissioner.
        Alternate or equivalent materials or methods of construction shall  be

Section 27-590 ::    
        
     
        §  27-590  Deferred  detailing. Where structural elements are normally
      detailed on shop or working drawings, the  application  for  the  permit
      shall  so  state,  and  issuance of the permit shall be conditioned upon
      future submission of such shop or working drawings showing the  approval
      of an architect or engineer with regard to such elements, or of a signed
      statement  by  an architect or engineer to the effect that such drawings
      were prepared to his or her satisfaction. In cases where  the  detailing
      of  structural  elements  has  been made on the basis of fire-resistance
      ratings, load  tables,  or  similar  data  as  given  in  manufacturer's
      catalogues, the application for approval of the plans shall so state and
      issuance  of  such  acceptance shall be conditional upon submission of a
      statement by  the  manufacturer,  or  of  other  supporting  documentary
      evidence  of  accreditation  furnished by the manufacturer, attesting to
      the accuracy of the data and stating that  such  data  were  derived  in
      conformance  with  the  provisions  of this code. Where the detailing of
      structural elements has been made on the  basis  of  data  published  in
      technical documents of recognized authority issued by, or accredited by,
      the agency or association promulgating the applicable reference standard
      cited in this code, such statements will not be required.
