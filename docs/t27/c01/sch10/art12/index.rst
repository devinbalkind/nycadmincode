Section 27-643
--------------

Section 27-643 ::    
        
     
        §  27-643  Scope.  The provisions of sections 27-644 through 27-648 of
      this article shall apply to the use of glass in the exterior wall  of  a
      building  and shall be limited to exterior application wherein the glass
      would not be subjected to any loads normal to the face  of  glass  other
      than  those  due  to  wind. For applications involving human impact, the
      provisions of section 27-651 of this  article  shall  apply.  For  other
      cases,  the  strength and mode of installation of glass shall conform to
      accepted industry standards.
    
    
    
    
    
    
    

Section 27-644
--------------

Section 27-644 ::    
        
     
        §  27-644  Support  for  glass  panels.  Glass shall be firmly held in
      place.   The supports shall  be  of  adequate  strength  to  resist  the
      applicable  design  wind  loads as prescribed in subchapter nine of this
      chapter.
    
    
    
    
    
    
    

Section 27-645
--------------

Section 27-645 ::    
        
     
        §  27-645  Glass  requirements.  Glass  shall meet the requirements of
      reference standard RS 10-68 for the applicable type, size, thickness and
      quality.
    
    
    
    
    
    
    

Section 27-646
--------------

Section 27-646 ::    
        
     
        §  27-646  Thickness  of  glass.  Thicknesses of glass panels shall be
      chosen either on the basis of  statistical  probability  of  breakage  (
      subdivision  (a)  of this section) or on the basis of table 10-7, at the
      designer's option.
        (a) Statistical probability. Thickness of glass panels shall be chosen
      so that the statistical  probability  of  breakage  when  the  glass  is
      initially  subjected to the design wind load specified in table RS 9-5-1
      does not exceed the values indicated in table 10-6. Probability or  load
      factors  used  for  design shall be derived by test. The sufficiency and
      validity of  such  test  data  shall  be  subject  to  approval  by  the
      commissioner.
        (b)   Alternate  requirements.  Alternative  to  the  requirements  of
      paragraph (a) above, the thickness of glass panels may  be  chosen  from
      table  10-7.    For  glass  with  assured minimum thickness greater than
      required by reference standard RS 10-68, the maximum areas in table 10-7
      may be increased in proportion to the assured minimum thickness.

--------------

Section 27-648 ::    
        
     
        §  27-648  Installation of glass panels. Glass panels shall be handled
      and installed so that their strength is  not  impaired  by  chipping  or
      scratching,  shall  be  fully  and  firmly bedded in their supports, and
      shall  be  mounted  in  a  manner  that  will  accommodate  differential
      movements due to thermal and loading conditions.

        §  27-649  Protection of glass panels. Glass panels installed in areas
      where they will be subject to unusual conditions of construction damage,
      such as spatter from welds or locations near materials hoists, shall  be
      protected  by  a  hardboard covering or its equivalent during the period
      that such work is in progress.

Section 27-650 ::    
        
     
        §  27-650  Deflection of support. The deflection of members supporting
      glass panels under the design wind load (measured perpendicular  to  the
      plane  of  the panel) shall not exceed L/175, where L is the span of the
      supporting  member.  In   no   case   shall   such   deflection   exceed
      three-quarters of an inch.

        §  27-651  Panels  subject  to  human impact loads. Glass in prime and
      storm doors, interior doors, fixed glass panels that may be mistaken for
      means of egress or ingress, shower  doors  and  tub  enclosures,  or  in
      similar  installations  wherein  one  or  more of the following criteria
      apply, shall meet the requirements  set  forth  in  table  10-9,  or  by
      comparative tests shall be proven to produce equivalent performance:
        (a) openings are located in regularly occupied spaces.
        (b)  lowest point of panel is less than eighteen inches above finished
