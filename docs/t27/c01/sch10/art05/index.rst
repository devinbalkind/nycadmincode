      addition of an accepted admixture.
     
        (2) WATER-CEMENT OR STRENGTH-CEMENT RATIO.
      Normal  weight  concrete  proportioned on the basis of preliminary tests
      shall be produced by using a water-cement ratio corresponding to a point
      on a strength-cement  or  water-cement  ratio  curve.  Proportioning  of
      lightweight  and  heavyweight  concrete, and concrete using an aggregate
      other  than  natural  sand,  gravel  or  stone  shall  be  by  using   a
      strength-cement content curve.  The point on the respective curves shall
      represent  a strength of concrete at the slump and age called for on the
      plans at least twenty-five percent higher than the  specified  strength,
      f'c.  The  cement  content  shall  not be less than the content shown in
      table 10-3.
        (3) PRELIMINARY TESTS. Preliminary tests of concrete shall be made  in
      advance  of  any  concreting  operation  by  a licensed concrete testing
      laboratory  acceptable  to  the  architect  or   engineer   of   record.
      Preliminary  tests shall consist of compression strength tests of molded
      concrete cylinders made in accordance with reference standards RS  10-17
      and  RS  10-21.  A  curve  representing the relation between the average
      strength of the concrete at twenty-eight days, or at any other specified
      age filed with the department, and  the  strength-cement  ratio  or  the
      water-cement ratio shall be established for the range of strength values
      at  the  slump  required  for the work. The tests shall include at least
      four mixes with different strength-cement  ratios  or  four  mixes  with
      different  water-cement  ratios and at least four cylinder specimens for
      each mix. The cylinder strength tests shall be supplemented by tests  to
      confirm  that  the  cement  and  aggregates conform to the provisions of
      reference standard RS 10-3.
        (4)  PREVIOUSLY  ACCEPTED  MIXES.  In  lieu  of  the  requirements  of
      paragraph   three   of  this  subdivision,  the  architect  or  engineer
      designated  for  controlled  inspection  may  permit  the  use  of   mix
      proportions  of  aggregates  having  the same specific gravity, size and
      gradation; cements of the same type and batch weight; admixtures of  the
    
      same  type  and  quantity; and other ingredients the same as or equal to
      those that have been previously submitted  with  applicable  preliminary
      tests  which  complied  with paragraphs one and two of this subdivision,
      and  which  have been accepted by the commissioner within the past year.
      If any of the mix proportions or ingredients  are  changed,  a  separate
      submission for acceptance shall be required.
        (5) QUALITY CONTROL AND INSPECTION OF MATERIALS AND OF BATCHING. Where
      concrete  materials  are used for structural elements defined in section
      27-585 of article one of this subchapter, quality control and inspection
      shall be provided at the batch plant  by  a  licensed  concrete  testing
      laboratory under the supervision of the architect or engineer designated
      for  controlled inspection, in accordance with the requirements of table
      10-1 and in sufficient scope to:
        a. Determine and record the actual batched weights of the  ingredients
      and the volume of water charged into the mixer;
        b.  Verify  that  such  weights conform to the weights and proportions
      required by the preliminary test mix,  adjusted  for  moisture  content,
      fineness modulus and gradation of aggregates;
        c. Verify conformance of the quality and condition of the materials to
      reference standard RS 10-3;
        d. Verify that the aggregates have the same specific gravity, size and
      gradation;  the cement is the same type and batch weight, the admixtures
      are the same type and quantity; and that any other ingredients  are  the
      same  as  or  equal to those used for the preparation of the preliminary
      test mixes;
        e.  For  all  concrete,  whether  or  not  designated  for  controlled
      inspection, attestation of the results of quality control and inspection
      at  the  batch  plant shall appear on a ticket accompanying each load of
      concrete. The attestation for subparagraphs  a,  b,  c  and  d  of  this
      paragraph shall be executed by the licensed concrete testing laboratory.
        f. The licensed concrete testing laboratory shall also attest that the
      slump  entrained  air  content and unit weight of the fresh concrete, as
      discharged from the mixer at the job site,  were  tested  in  accordance
      with  reference  standards  RS  10-49,  RS 10-51, RS 10-52, RS 10-61, RS
      10-62, RS 10-63 and RS 10-64, and that all were in compliance  with  the
      accepted mix design.
        (b) Method II. Proportioning on the basis of field experience.
        (1)  PROPORTIONING.  For  the computation of the standard deviation in
      accordance with reference standard RS 10-14, mixes with test  data  from
      previous   projects,  similarly  proportioned  in  accordance  with  the
      provisions of subdivision (a) of this section, and having  materials  of
      similar  density  and  admixtures and having a slump equal to or greater
      than that at which the concrete is to be  placed  shall  be  used.  Such
      mixes  may  be  accepted  subject  to  the  approval of the architect or
      engineer designated for controlled inspection.
        (2) STRENGTH. The required average strength, fcr, to be  used  as  the
      basis  for  the  selection  of mix proportions, shall in no case be less
      than fifteen percent higher than the specified strength  called  for  on
      the plans.
        (3)  BATCHING.  The  concrete shall be produced either in the concrete
      production facility used to produce the concrete from  which  the  tests
      were  made to develop the field experience data referred to in paragraph
      one of this subdivision or, subject to the approval of the architect  or
      engineer   designated   for   controlled  inspection,  in  any  concrete
      production facility that has data showing a record of standard deviation
      equal to or less than  that  of  the  original  facility.  All  concrete
      proportioned  according to field experience shall be produced in a plant
      with automatic recording equipment for all ingredients.
    
        (4) QUALITY CONTROL AND INSPECTION OF MATERIALS AND OF BATCHING.  When
      the  concrete  is batched in a plant where automatic recording equipment
      documents  the  batched  weights  or  volumes  of  cement,   aggregates,
      admixtures and water, no inspection of the materials or of the batching,
      nor   any   attestation   by  a  licensed  concrete  testing  laboratory
      responsible to the  architect  or  engineer  designated  for  controlled
      inspection, shall be required. A concrete producer shall:
        a.  Verify  that  such  weights  conform  to  the required weights and
      proportions, and to the  strength-cement  ratio  or  water-cement  ratio
      required  by  the proportioning established pursuant to paragraph one of
      this subdivision, adjusted for moisture content,  fineness  modules  and
      gradation of aggregates.
        b. Verify conformance of the quality and condition of the materials to
      reference standard RS 10-3.
        c.  Attest,  on  a  ticket  accompanying  each  load, to the specified
      strength  of  the  concrete,  the  actual  weights  or  volume  of   the
      ingredients, and the weight or volume of water charged into the mixer at
      the  batch  plant  or  to  be  added  at  the job site. A statement that
      subparagraph b of this paragraph has been complied with  shall  also  be
      included.
        d.   If   at  any  time  the  automatic  recording  equipment  becomes
      inoperative, the concrete production facility may be permitted, but only
      with the approval of the architect or engineer designated for controlled
      inspection, to batch and mix concrete for a period not to  exceed  three
      consecutive  working days. During such a period, the concrete production
      facility shall engage a concrete batch plant inspector from  a  licensed
      concrete  testing laboratory to observe and record the actual weights of
      the cement, aggregates, admixtures and other ingredients, and the weight
      or volume of water charged into the mixers. If the  automatic  recording
      equipment  is  inoperative  for  a  period longer than three consecutive
      working days the concrete production facility shall  not  batch  or  mix
      concrete  and  the  architect  or  engineer  designated  for  controlled
      inspection shall notify the commissioner in writing that such  equipment
      is inoperative.
     
        (c)  Method  III.  Average Concrete. (1) in lieu of making preliminary
      tests, average concrete limited to the concrete strengths shown in table
      10-3A below may be used, and the cement content shall not be  less  than
      the   value  given  in  table  10-3A  for  the  corresponding  specified
      compressive strengths, nor shall the total  volume  of  water  (moisture
      plus added water) exceed that specified therein, provided that the total
      yardage  placed  does  not  exceed  fifty  cubic yards and the levels of
      calculated stress do not exceed seventy percent of the  basic  allowable
      stresses.

Section 27-607 ::    
        
     
        ยง 27-607 Inspections. Inspection of concrete and concrete construction
      shall  conform  to  the  requirements  of  tables  10-1 and 10-2 and the
      provisions of this subchapter.
        (a)  Controlled  inspection.   Controlled   inspection   of   concrete
      construction shall include:
        (1)   STRENGTH  TESTS.  Strength  tests  shall  be  performed  on  all
      structural concrete. The provisions of reference standard RS 10-3  shall
      apply.  A licensed concrete testing laboratory shall, in compliance with
      reference standards  RS  10-17,  RS  10-51  and  RS  10-52,  sample  the
      concrete,  make  and  cure the test specimens at the job site, transport
      the specimens to the laboratory and test the specimens  for  compressive
      strength.  Written  reports  of  the  results  shall be furnished to the
      architect or engineer designated for controlled inspection  and  to  the
      concrete producer immediately, but not more than five days following the
      conclusion  of  the  compression strength tests. Test specimens shall be
      stored on the job site in an insulated curing box of sufficient size and
      strength to contain all the  specimens  made  in  any  four  consecutive
      working  days  and  to  protect  the  specimens from falling over, being
      jarred or otherwise disturbed during the period of initial  curing.  The
      box   shall  be  erected,  furnished  and  maintained  by  the  concrete
      contractor. Such box shall be equipped to provide the  moisture  and  to
      regulate  the  temperature  necessary  to  maintain  the  proper  curing
      conditions required by reference standard RS 10-52. Such  box  shall  be
      located  in an area free from vibration such as pile driving and traffic
      of all kinds. No concrete requiring inspection shall be delivered to the
      site until such storage curing box has been  provided.  Specimens  shall
      remain  undisturbed  in  the  curing box until ready for delivery to the
      testing laboratory but not less than sixteen hours. Specimens  delivered
      to  the  laboratory  prior  to  an age of forty-eight hours shall not be
      demolded prior to delivery. All specimens  shall  be  carefully  removed
      from  the box and transported to the laboratory by the licensed concrete
      testing laboratory  in  accordance  with  the  provisions  of  reference
      standard  RS  10-52.  All specimens shall be delivered to the laboratory
      before the laboratory closes at  the  end  of  the  second  working  day
      following the day the specimens were molded.  The date of arrival at the
      laboratory  shall be recorded on the specimen test reports. All concrete
      failing to meet the specified minimum  strength  requirements  shall  be
      rejected   by  the  architect  or  engineer  designated  for  controlled
      inspection pending verification of the adequacy of the  construction  as
      described in section 27-598 of article three of this subchapter.
        (2) ADDITIONAL TESTS. Each sample of fresh concrete made in accordance
      with  reference  standard  RS  10-51 for the purpose of molding strength
      test specimens shall be made under the supervision of the  architect  or
      engineer  designated  for  controlled  inspection.  Each sample shall be
      tested by the licensed concrete  testing  laboratory  to  determine  its
      slump  in accordance with reference standard RS 10-49, its entrained air
      content in accordance with reference standards RS 10-61  and  RS  10-62,
      its  unit  weight in accordance with reference standards RS 10-63 and RS
      10-64 and its temperature.  If  any  of  the  tests  fail  to  meet  the
      specified  requirements,  the  concrete  shall  be sampled again and the
      particular test that failed shall be repeated. If the second test  fails
      to  meet  the  specified  requirements,  then,  with the approval of the
      architect or engineer designated for controlled inspection,  adjustments
      shall  be  made  to the concrete in the mixer to correct the deficiency.
      Test specimens shall not be molded from any sample that did not meet the
      specified requirements nor shall the concrete from which the sample  was
      taken  be placed in the structure, provided, however, that such concrete
      may be used elsewhere  in  the  work  where  it  meets  or  exceeds  the
    
      specified  requirements,  but only with the approval of the architect or
      engineer designated  for  controlled  inspection.  In  such  case,  test
      specimens  shall  be  molded by the licensed concrete testing laboratory
      which  shall  also  record  the  precise location where the concrete was
      placed in the structure.
        (3) CONTROLLED INSPECTION LOG BOOK. A controlled inspection log  book,
      limited  solely  to the concrete construction work, readily available to
      inspectors and representatives of the department, concrete suppliers and
      the architect and/or engineer of record, shall be maintained at the  job
      site  by the architect or engineer designated for controlled inspection,
      who shall make therein daily entries pertaining to the progress  of  the
      work.  The  entries shall describe, but not be limited to, the location,
      size and dimensions  of  the  concrete  members  for  which  forms  were
      constructed  that  day; the reinforcement installed in, and the specific
      locations  and  time  spans  of,  every  concrete  placement;  the   air
      temperature,  wind  velocity  and direction and other weather conditions
      during the twenty-four hours after  concrete  has  been  placed,  speci-
      fically at eight a.m., noon and four p.m., the protections taken against
      excessive  temperatures and adverse weather conditions at each placement
      made that day; the methods used, to cure the  concrete  and  the  period
      during  which  such  methods were maintained; the actual hour when forms
      were stripped and shores were reinstalled and tensioning was applied  to
      all   prestressed   members.   The  log  shall  become  a  part  of  the
      documentation to be filed with the commissioner as provided  in  section
      27-606  and  shall  include the attestation of the architect or engineer
      designated for controlled inspection that the concrete construction work
      complies with the approved plans and the provisions of this code.
        (b) Other required inspection. Quality control or inspection shall  be
      provided  with  respect to all operations of mixing and placing concrete
      and reinforcement that are not designated for controlled inspection.  In
      the  case  of  sidewalks,  curbs,  paving,  slabs-on-grade  and any work
      designated in table 10-1  under  the  caption  "Elements  That  Are  Not
      Subject  to  Controlled  Inspection"  or in table 10-2 under the caption
      "Operations on Structural Elements That Are Not  Subject  to  Controlled
      Inspection,"  all inspections shall be subject to and in accordance with
      the requirements of subdivision (b) of section 27-132. If  any  test  to
      determine  the  quality  or  compressive  strength  of  the  concrete is
      required, the fresh concrete shall be  sampled  and  tested  for  slump,
      entrained air content, unit weight and temperature. Compression strength
      test  specimens  shall  be  molded  only  by a licensed concrete testing
      laboratory or by a person certified by the American  Concrete  Institute
      as  qualified to perform such function. Attestation shall be executed by
      the person superintending the use of the material in accordance with the
      requirements of subdivision (b) of section 27-132 of  article  seven  of
      subchapter one of this chapter.

        ยง  27-610 Short-span concrete floor and roof construction supported on
      steel beams. In lieu of analysis, the following empirical procedures may
      be used for the design of  short-span  concrete  floor  and  roof  slabs
      containing  draped  reinforcement  and  supported  on  steel  beams. The
      empirical equations described  in  subdivisions  (c)  and  (d)  of  this
      section  shall  apply  only  where  the  steel  beams are placed, or are
      encased, in a manner that will provide section for the transfer of shear
      from slabs to beams equivalent to, or in excess of, the  slab  thickness
      required by said equations.
        (a)  Concrete.  The concrete shall have a minimum compressive strength
      at twenty-eight days of seven hundred psi.
        (b) Reinforcement. Reinforcement shall consist of steel fabric,  rods,
      or other suitable shapes that shall be continuous or successively lapped
      to  function  as  a continuous sheet. The main reinforcement shall be at
      least 0.15% of the gross cross section where continuous steel fabric  is
      used  and at least 0.25% of the gross cross section where other forms of
      steel reinforcement are used. All reinforcing shall be draped, with  the
      center of the reinforcement at the center of the span one inch above the
      bottom  of the slab and the center of reinforcement over the support one
      inch below the top of the slab.
        (c) Minimum slab thickness. The minimum total  thickness  of  concrete
      floor  and  roof  construction  shall  be  determined  by  the following
      formula, but shall not be less than four inches:
     
                                         L     w-75
                                    t = ___ + ______
                                         2      200
     
      where: t = total thickness (in.)
             L = clear span between steel flanges (ft.)
             w = gross uniform load (dead load plus reduced live load) (psf).
     
        (d) Allowable Load. The allowable load  shall  be  determined  by  the
      following formula:
     
                                         3CAs
                                    w = ______
                                           L2
     
      where:  w = gross uniform load (psf)
             As = cross-sectional area of main reinforcement (sq. in. per ft.
                  of slab width)
              L = clear span between steel flanges in feet. (L shall not
                exceed ten feet in any case, and when the gross floor
                load exceeds two hundred psi shall not exceed eight feet)
              C = the following coefficient for steel having an ultimate
                  strength of at least fifty-five thousand psi;
     
        1. For lightweight aggregate concrete:
        a. twenty thousand when reinforcement is continuous.
        b.  fourteen  thousand when reinforcement is hooked or attached to one
      or both supports.
        2. For stone concrete:
        a. twenty-three thousand when reinforcement is continuous.
        b. fifteen thousand when reinforcement is hooked or attached to one or
      both supports.
        (1) When the above formula is used the reinforcement shall  be  hooked
      or attached to one or both supports or be continuous.
    
        (2)  If steel of an ultimate strength in excess of fifty-five thousand
      psi is used, the above coefficient may be increased in the ratio of  the
      ultimate strength to fifty-five thousand but at most by thirty percent.
        (e)  Openings  in  floors  and  roofs. Openings more than one foot six
      inches on a side  shall  be  framed.  All  areas  encompassing  multiple
      openings aggregating more than one foot six inches in any ten foot width
      or span of floor or roof slab shall be framed.
