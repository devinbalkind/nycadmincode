Section 27-636 ::    
        
     
        §  27-636  Suspenders.  (a) Bridge wire cable. Bridge wire cables used
      for suspenders shall be either bridge strand or bridge  rope  fabricated
      from galvanized bridge wire.
        (1)  WIRE.  Wire  shall  be produced from rods rolled from high carbon
      steel, the composition of which shall be controlled to provide  internal
      soundness,  uniformity  of chemical composition and physical properties,
      freedom  from  injurious  surface  imperfections,  and  shall  meet  the
      following requirements.
        a.  The minimum ultimate tensile strength of zinc-coated wire shall be
      as follows:
     
           Class A coating .............. two hundred twenty thousand psi
           Class B coating .............. two hundred ten thousand psi
           Class C coating .............. two hundred thousand psi
     
        b. Yield strength shall be one hundred fifty thousand psi minimum  for
      zinc-coated  wire  with  class  A  or class B coating, one hundred forty
      thousand psi minimum for zinc-coated wire with class C coating, based on
      the cross-sectional  area  of  the  coated  wire  when  loaded  to  0.7%
      elongation in a ten inch gage length. In determining the yield strength,
      an  initial  stress  equivalent  to  forty-two  thousand  psi,  based on
      cross-sectional area of the coated wire, shall be applied  to  the  wire
      sample.  At  this  loading,  the  entensometer  shall be attached and an
      initial dial reading set at the equivalent of 0.15% elongation.
        c. Elongation shall be four percent minimum in a ten inch gage length,
      determined as the permanent increase in length after failure of a marked
      section of the wire originally ten inch in length except that a value of
      two percent will be permitted for wires 0.110 in. or  less  in  diameter
      having a class A zinc coating.
        d.  The  zinc-coated  wire  must  withstand  wrapping  at  a  rate not
      exceeding fifteen turns per minute twice around a mandrel equal to three
      times the wire diameter without fracture of the steel.
        e. The wire used in bridge strand or bridge rope shall be  zinc-coated
      (galvanized)  in  accordance with the requirements of table 10-5. Weight
      of coating shall be determined in  accordance  with  the  provisions  of
      reference standard RS 10-24.

        (2)  BRIDGE  STRAND. Bridge strands shall be made from wires complying
      with subparagraphs a through e of paragraph one of this subdivision, and
      shall meet the following requirements:
        a.  The  wires  shall  be made in such lengths that the strands can be
      manufactured with no splices in the outside  wires.  Splicing  of  inner
      wires  during  the  stranding  operation is permissible. When joints are
      necessary in any wires, they shall be electrically butt welded and shall
      be recoated in a workmanlike manner. Joints in the wires of strand shall
      be made and dispersed  in  a  manner  that  will  maintain  the  minimum
      specified breaking strength of the strand.
        b.   The  minimum  breaking  strength  shall  be  based  on  tests  to
      destruction and shall be certified by the manufacturer.
        c. Bridge strand shall be prestretched to produce a stable modulus  of
      elasticity  of  at  least  the  following values for strand wires having
      class A coating:
     
      one-half inch to two and nine-sixteenths
        inches dia. ................................. twenty-four million psi
      two and five-eighths inches and larger ........ twenty-three million psi
     
        For bridge strands that have classes  B  and  C  zinc-coating  on  the
      outside  wires,  the  modulus  of  elasticity shall not be more than one
      million psi less than the corresponding values for bridge strand with  a
      class  A  coating.  The  pre-stretching load shall not exceed fifty-five
      percent of the breaking strength of the strand.
        (3) BRIDGE ROPE. Bridge rope shall be made from wires  complying  with
      subparagraphs  a  through  e  of  paragraph one of this subdivision, and
      shall meet the following requirements:
        a. Joints are permissible in  inner  and  outer  wires  and  shall  be
      electrically  butt welded and shall be recoated in a workmanlike manner.
      Joints in the wires of strand shall be made and dispersed  in  a  manner
      that will maintain the minimum specified breaking strength of the rope.
        b.   The  minimum  breaking  strength  shall  be  based  on  tests  to
      destruction and shall be certified by the manufacturer.
        c. Bridge rope shall be prestretched to produce a  stable  modulus  of
      elasticity  of at least twenty million psi for rope wires having a class
      A coating. For bridge rope that has class B and C zinc-coatings  on  the
      outside  wires,  the  modulus  of  elasticity shall not be more than one
      million psi less than the corresponding value for  bridge  rope  with  a
      class  A  coating.  The  prestretching  load shall not exceed fifty-five
      percent of the breaking strength of the rope.
        (b) Other materials. Any structural material permitted for  use  under
      the  provisions  of  other  sections  of this subchapter may be used for
      support of a suspended structure including, but not limited to, types of
      steel permitted for use under the provisions of  reference  standard  RS
      10-5; reinforcing steel and wire, prestressing wire and strand, and high
      strength  alloy  steel  bars conforming to the requirements of reference
      standard RS 10-3; and steel conforming to the requirements of  reference
      standards  RS  10-66  and  RS 10-69. Prestressing wire and strand may be
      used for suspenders without the application of prestressing  force.  All
      such  suspenders  shall  be  protected as described in section 27-642 of
      this article.

Section 27-637 ::    
        
     
        §  27-637 Tests of materials for bridge wire suspenders. The following
      minimum quantities of bridge wire for suspenders shall be tested:
        (1) Tensile strength tests of the wires shall be made  of  a  specimen
      cut from each coil of zinc coated wire.
        (2)  Tests  for  elongation  and  for  yield strength shall be made on
      samples from approximately ten percent of the  coils  of  any  one  size
      finished  wire.  If  any  of  these  tests  fail  to  meet the specified
      requirements, all the coils in that lot of finished wire shall be tested
      and only coils that satisfactorily pass the test shall be used.
        (3) Tests of the zinc coating shall  be  made  of  approximately  five
      percent  of  the coils of any one size of finished wire. If any of these
      tests fail to meet the specified requirements, all the coils in that lot
      of finished wire shall be tested and only coils that satisfactorily pass
      the test shall be used.

Section 27-638 ::    
        
     
        §  27-638  Tests  of  materials  for  other  types  of suspenders. The
      applicable provisions of reference standards RS 10-3 and RS  10-5  shall
      apply.
    
    
    
    
    
    
    

Section 27-639
--------------

Section 27-639 ::    
        
     
        §  27-639  Design.  The following design requirements shall supplement
      the applicable provisions of this subchapter.
        (a) Flexibility. Suspenders, unless  encased,  may  be  considered  as
      perfectly flexible.
        (b)  Elastic  stretch.  The elastic stretch of the suspenders shall be
      considered.
        (c) Displacement. Displacement resulting from changes in magnitude and
      position of load and its affects on stress shall be considered.
        (d) Other considerations. Consideration shall be given to the  effects
      of  temperature  variations,  partial  and reversible wind loadings, and
      vibration.
        (e) Allowable working load. The allowable working load  in  suspenders
      formed  from bridge wire cable shall be computed on the basis of factors
      equal to one and one-half times dead load plus two  and  one-half  times
      live load or one and two-tenths times dead load plus two times live load
      plus  two  times  wind load, applied to the specified, minimum, ultimate
      strength of the suspender. The  allowable  working  load  in  suspenders
      conforming   to   the  materials  specifications  or  several  reference
      standards of this code shall  be  the  allowable  working  stresses  for
      tension  members  as prescribed in the applicable reference standard or,
      for those materials where allowable stresses for tension members are not
      prescribed, on factors of one and one-half  times  dead  load  plus  two
      times  live  load  or  one  and  two-tenths times dead load plus one and
      one-half times live load, plus one and one-half times  wind  load,  also
      applied to the specified minimum, ultimate strength of the suspender. In
      no case, however, shall the factor, applied to the yield strength of the
      material  or  to the prestretching or prestressing force, exceed one and
      one-tenth times dead load plus one and one-quarter times live load.

Section 27-640 ::    
        
     
        §  27-640  Fittings for wire cable suspenders. Fittings for wire cable
      suspenders shall be capable of developing the specified minimum ultimate
      strength of the attached cable or strand without developing stresses  in
      the  fitting  equal  to,  or  in  excess  of,  the yield strength of the
      material in the fitting. One end fitting, of each type and  size  to  be
      used,  shall  be tested to insure the adequacy of the fitting to develop
      the ultimate strength of the cable or  strand  to  which  it  is  to  be
      attached.
