Section 27-591
--------------

Section 27-591 ::    
        
     
        § 27-591 Stability. Except as provided in article twelve of subchapter
      eleven  of  this chapter with regard to foundation elements, a building,
      or any element thereof shall be proportioned to provide a minimum factor
      of safety of  1.50  against  failure  by  sliding  or  overturning.  The
      required  stability  shall  be provided solely by the dead load plus any
      permanent anchorages which may be provided.
    
    
    
    
    
    
    

Section 27-592
--------------

Section 27-592 ::    
        
     
        §   27-592  Bracing.  Unless  otherwise  specified  in  the  reference
      standards,  members  used  to  brace  compression   members   shall   be
      proportioned  to  resist  an  axial load of at least two per cent of the
      total  compressive  design  stress  in  the  member  braced,  plus   any
      transverse shear therein.
    
    
    
    
    
    
    

Section 27-593
--------------

Section 27-593 ::    
        
     
        §  27-593  Secondary  stresses. Secondary stresses in trusses shall be
      considered and where of significant magnitude, their  effects  shall  be
      provided for in the design.
    
    
    
    
    
    
    

Section 27-594
--------------

Section 27-594 ::    
        
     
        §  27-594  Combination  of  loads.  Dead  loads, live loads (including
      impact) and reduced live loads, where applicable, shall be considered as
      basic loads. Wind, earthquake, thermal forces, shrinkage, and  unreduced
      live loads (where live load reduction is permitted by subchapter nine of
      this  chapter)  shall  be  considered as loads of infrequent occurrence.
      Members  shall  have  adequate  capacity  to   resist   all   applicable
      combinations  of the loads listed in subchapter nine of this chapter, in
      accordance with the following:
        (a) Where design is based on allowable working stresses, the loads  as
      described  in subchapter nine of this chapter shall be multiplied by the
      following factors and the design shall be based on  the  resulting  load
      values:
        (1)  For  combinations  of basic loads, only, the factor shall be 1.0,
      except that for  the  design  of  temporary  structures  (defined  as  a
      structure which will be in place six months or less) the factor shall be
      0.75.
        (2)  For  any combination of one or more basic loads with any one load
      of infrequent occurrence, the factor shall be 0.75, except that for  the
      design of temporary structures the factor shall be 0.67.
        (3)  For  any  combination of one or more basic loads with two or more
      loads of infrequent occurrence, the factor shall be 0.67.
        Exception. The provisions of reference standards RS 10-8 and  RS  10-9
      relating  to increases of allowable unit stresses for short-time loading
      shall apply.
        (b) Where design is based on  ultimate  strength  criteria  (including
      plastic  design  of  steel  structures  and  proportioning  of suspended
      structures), the loads, as described in subchapter nine of this  chapter
      shall  be  multiplied  by  the  factors  indicated in subdivision (e) of
      section  27-639  of  article  eleven  of  this  subchapter  and  in  the
      applicable  reference  standards.  The  design  shall  be  based  on the
      resulting load values.
        Exceptions. 1. Where combinations of load for which factors are  given
      in  the  reference standard include the load of wind (or earthquake) the
      design additionally shall consider combinations  of  load  wherein  each
      other  of  the  loads of frequent occurrence as listed in this paragraph
      are substituted for the load of wind.
        2. The design also shall consider combinations  of  load  wherein  two
      most  critical  of  the loads of infrequent occurrence are combined with
      the basic loads. For such combination, however, the factors indicated in
      the reference standards and in subdivision  (e)  of  section  27-639  of
      article  eleven  of  this  subchapter  for suspended structures, for the
      combination of basic loads plus one load of infrequent occurrence may be
      reduced fifteen per cent.
    
    
    
    
    
    
    

Section 27-595
--------------

Section 27-595 ::    
        
     
        §  27-595  Deflection  limitations.  The  applicable provisions of the
      several reference standards cited in this  subchapter  shall  apply.  In
      addition,  the  total  of  the  dead plus live load vertical deflections
      (including effects of creep and shrinkage) of members, supporting walls,
      veneered walls, or partitions constructed of  or  containing  panels  of
      masonry,  glass,  or other frangible materials shall not exceed 1/360 of
      the span.
