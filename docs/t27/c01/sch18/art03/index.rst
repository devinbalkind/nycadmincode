      and escalators shall be made on behalf of  the  owner  by  an  insurance
      company,  elevator  maintenance company, elevator manufacturer, elevator
      inspection company, or other person, each of which must be acceptable to
      the commissioner. The department shall promulgate rules and  regulations
      establishing  criteria  as  to  the  qualifications of such companies or

      January first and September fifteenth of each year. Reports  by  private
      inspection  agencies  shall  be  on  such  forms  and  in such manner as
      required by the commissioner. Such report  shall  be  delivered  to  the
      owner  of each elevator or escalator inspected listing all violations of
      any of the provisions of this subchapter within five days of inspection,
      and a signed copy of the report of each inspection shall be  filed  with
      the  commissioner.  The failure to have such inspection performed within
      the prescribed period and  to  file  a  copy  of  the  report  with  the
      department  on  or  before  September  thirtieth of each year shall be a
      violation of this section, which shall be  punishable  pursuant  to  the
      provisions  of  section 26-125 of title twenty-six of the administrative
      code. After such violation is placed the owner may file such report  and
      the  department  shall  enter  a  notation in its records of the date on
      which such report was received by the  department.  After  the  date  of
      receipt  by the department, the per diem penalty provided by subdivision
      c of section 26-125 of title twenty-six of the administrative code shall
      be stayed. The department shall maintain the violation on  its  records,
      with  a  notation of the date on which such a report was received by the
      department. On or before October fifteenth of each year all  defects  as
      found upon such inspection shall be corrected.

      certification  that the required installation has been made. The reports
      shall be on such forms and  in  such  manner  as  the  commissioner  may
      require. Failure to file such report by such a date shall be a violation
      of  this  section, and shall be punishable pursuant to section 26-125 of
      title twenty-six of the administrative code.
        (c) In multiple dwellings (either J1  or  J2  occupancy  groups),  the

      repair work.  Such repair person or company shall be one of the elevator
      inspection  agencies or inspectors employed thereby currently acceptable
      to the commissioner. The name, address  and  telephone  number  of  such
      elevator  repair person or company shall be maintained on each premises,
      in a location readily accessible to employees of  this  department,  and
