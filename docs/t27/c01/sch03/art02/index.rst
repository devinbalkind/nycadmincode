      altered or erected shall, for the purposes of this code,  be  classified

      be separated from one another as follows:
        a.  Spaces  classified in occupancy groups having a higher fire index,
      as listed in table 3-1, than the  fire  index  of  the  occupancy  group
      classification of the building, shall be separated from adjoining spaces
      by construction meeting the fire-resistance rating requirements for fire
      divisions  under  the provisions of subdivision (a) of section 27-339 of
      article five of subchapter five of this chapter. Such occupancies shall,
      for the purposes of this code, be classified  and  treated  as  separate
      buildings (hereinafter referred to as "building section").
        b. Spaces classified in occupancy groups having the same or lower fire
      index,  as  listed  in  table  3-1, than the fire index of the occupancy
      group classification of the building, shall be separated from  adjoining
      spaces  by  construction meeting the fire-resistance rating requirements
      for fire separations under the provisions of subdivision (b) of  section
      27-339 of article five of subchapter five of this chapter.

Section 27-242
--------------

Section 27-242 ::    
        
     
        §  27-242  Multiple occupancy or use. When a building or space is used
      for multiple  purposes,  involving  different  activities  at  different
      times,  the  building or space shall be given a separate occupancy group
      classification for each of  the  activities  involved.  The  design  and
      construction  of  the  building or space shall be in accordance with the
      most restrictive provisions of this  code  that  apply  to  any  of  the
      occupancy  group classifications utilized. However, a minor variation of
      any occupancy or use  of  a  space  from  technical  compliance  with  a
      particular  space  occupancy  classification  shall not be prohibited if
      such variation is normally associated with the occupancy  classification
      and no specific danger or hazard is created.
