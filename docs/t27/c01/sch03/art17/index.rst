Article 17 - MIXED CONSTRUCTION
===============================

Section 27-286
--------------

Section 27-286 ::    
        
     
        ยง  27-286  Classification.  When  two  or more classes of construction
      occur within the same building, the entire building shall be subject  to
      the  most  restrictive occupancy and size limitations for the classes of
      construction involved. However, if the occupancies within the  different
      classes  of  construction  are completely separated by construction that
      meets the fire-resistance rating requirements for fire divisions  listed
      in  table  5-2 then each occupancy so separated may, for the purposes of
      this code, be considered as a separate building ("building section").

Section 27-287 ::    
        
     
        ยง   27-287  Restrictions.  In  buildings  of  mixed  construction,  no
      structural element shall be supported by  construction  having  a  lower
      fire-resistance   rating  than  that  required  for  the  element  being
      supported.
