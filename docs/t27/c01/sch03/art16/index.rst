Section 27-280 ::    
        
     
        §   27-280   Classification.   Buildings  and  spaces  in  combustible
      construction  group  II  are  those  in  which  the  walls,  partitions,
      structural  members,  floors, and roofs are constructed wholly or partly
      of   combustible   materials   affording   the   required   degree    of
      fire-resistance  specified  in  table  3-4. The combustible construction
      group II consists of classes II-A, II-B, II-C, II-D, and II-E.

Section 27-281 ::    
        
     
        §  27-281  Construction class II-A. Includes heavy timber construction
      in which fire-resistance is attained by limiting the  minimum  sizes  of
      wood  structural  members  and  the minimum thickness and composition of
      wood floors and roofs; by avoiding concealed  spaces  under  floors  and
      roofs  or by providing fire-stopping protection for these spaces; and by
      using fastenings, construction details,  and  adhesives  for  structural
      members  as required by article seven of subchapter ten of this chapter.
      The minimum dimensions  for  framing  members  shall  be  prescribed  in
      section  27-623  of  article  seven  of  subchapter ten of this chapter,
      except that members which are protected  to  provide  a  fire-resistance
      rating of at least one hour need not comply with this requirement.
    
    
    
    
    
    
    

Section 27-282

      which the exterior walls, fire walls, exitways, and shaft enclosures are
      of noncombustible materials having the required fire-resistance ratings;
      and in which the floors, roofs,  and  interior  framing  are  wholly  or
      partly  of  wood  of  smaller  dimensions  than  required for class II-A
      construction, or are of other combustible or  noncombustible  materials,
      having the required fire-resistance ratings.
    
    
    
    
    
    
    

Section 27-283

Section 27-283 ::    
        
     
        §  27-283  Construction  class  II-C. Includes buildings and spaces in
      which the exterior walls, fire walls, exitways, and shaft enclosures are
      of noncombustible materials having the required fire-resistance ratings;
      and in which the floors, roofs,  and  interior  framing  are  wholly  or
      partly  of  wood  of  smaller  dimensions  than  required for class II-A
      construction, or are of other combustible  or  noncombustible  materials
      having no fire-resistance ratings.
    
    
    
    
    
    
    

Section 27-284
--------------

Section 27-284 ::    
        
     
        §  27-284  Construction  class  II-D. Includes buildings and spaces in
      which the exterior walls, bearing walls,  floors,  roofs,  and  interior
      framing  are generally of wood or other combustible materials having the
      required fire-resistance ratings.
    
    
    
    
    
    
    

Section 27-285
--------------

Section 27-285 ::    
        
     
        §  27-285  Construction  class  II-E. Includes buildings and spaces in
      which the exterior walls are generally  of  wood  or  other  combustible
      materials  having the required fire-resistance ratings, and in which the
      bearing walls, floors, roofs, and interior framing are of wood or  other
      combustible materials, generally having no fire-resistance ratings.
