Section 27-269 ::    
        
     
        §  27-269  Construction  classes. Table 3-3 lists construction classes
      that shall be  established  for  classifying  buildings  and  spaces  by
      construction  in  accordance  with  the  provisions of articles fifteen,
      sixteen and seventeen of this subchapter.

Section 27-270
--------------

Section 27-270 ::    
        
     
        § 27-270 Classification of buildings and spaces. Every building, room,
      or  space  hereafter  altered or erected shall, for the purposes of this
      code be classified in one of the construction classes  listed  in  table
      3-3.
    
    
    
    
    
    
    

Section 27-271
--------------

Section 27-271 ::    
        
     
        §   27-271   Classification  table.  The  fire-resistance  ratings  of
      construction elements in hours listed in table 3-4 shall be  used  as  a
      basis   for   classifying   buildings   and   spaces   by  construction.
      Fire-resistance ratings  shall  be  based  on  the  test  procedures  of
      reference  standard RS3-1 and shall apply to all occupancy groups except
      as  specifically  noted.  For   hazardous   occupancies   involving   an
      exceptionally  high  degree  of  fire  risk  or  an  exceptionally  high
      concentration of combustible or flammable contents, the commissioner may
      increase the requirements of table 3-4.
     
                 (For Table 3-4 see chapter 839 of the laws of 1986)
     
      Notes:
        a. The area of openings permitted in exterior walls at any story shall
      be obtained by multiplying the percentage shown  in  the  table  by  the
      exterior  separation distance in feet, and then multiplying that product
      by the square-foot area of the facade of that  story.  Requirements  for
      protected  exterior openings shall not apply to churches or to buildings
      classified in occupancy groups  J-2  and  J-3.  See  section  27-331  of
      article   four  of  subchapter  five  of  this  chapter  for  additional
      requirements for exterior walls and exterior wall openings.
        b. Upon special application, the commissioner may permit exterior wall
      openings to be constructed in excess of the permitted  area  established
      by  table  3-4  if  such  openings at the time of their construction are
      located at least sixty feet  in  a  direct  line  from  any  neighboring
      building  except  as  otherwise permitted by footnote f. Such additional
      openings may not,  however,  be  credited  toward  meeting  any  of  the
      mandatory natural light or ventilation requirements of subchapter twelve
      of  chapter  one  of  this  title.  If any neighboring building is later
      altered or constructed to come within the above distance limitation, the
      affected exterior openings shall immediately be closed with construction
      meeting  the  fire-resistance  rating  requirements  for  exterior  wall
      construction of the building in which they are located.
        c. Applies to occupancy groups A, B-1, B-2, and D-1.
        d. Applies  to  all  occupancy  groups  other  than those described in
      footnote c.
        e. See subdivision (i) of section 27-375 of article five of subchapter
      six of  this  chapter  for  additional  impact  resistance  requirements
      applicable  to  certain  stair  enclosures and for certain exceptions to
      stair enclosure requirements.
        f. When two or more buildings are constructed on the same lot, and the
      combined floor area of the buildings does not exceed the  limits  estab-
      lished  by  tables  4-1  and  4-2  for  any  one  of  the  buildings, no
      fire-resistance rating shall be required for nonbearing portions of  the
      exterior  walls of those buildings facing each other, and there shall be
      no limitation on the permitted amount of exterior openings.
        g. Fire retardant treated wood  complying  with  the  requirements  of
      section  27-328  of article three of subchapter five of this chapter may
      be used.
        h. Tabulated ratings apply to buildings over one story in  height.  In
      one  story  buildings roof construction may be of material having 0 hour
      fire-resistance rating.
        i. Materials which are not noncombustible, as  defined  in  subchapter
      two of chapter one of this title, may be used in nonbearing construction
      elements if they fall into one of the following categories:
        1. Materials  having  a  structural base of noncombustible material as
      defined in subchapter two, and having a surface not over one-eighth inch
    
      thick which when tested in accordance with the provisions  of  reference
      standard RS 3-2 has a flame spread rating not higher than fifty.
        2. Materials  which  when  tested in accordance with the provisions of
      reference standard RS 3-2 have a surface flame spread rating not  higher
      than  twenty-five  without evidence of continued progressive combustion,
      and which are of such composition that surfaces which would  be  exposed
      by cutting through the material in any way would not have a flame spread
      rating higher than twenty-five without evidence of continued progressive
      combustion.
        j. Applies   to   the   construction  of  the  street  floor  and  all
      construction below the level of the street floor in buildings or  spaces
      classified  in  occupancy  group  J-2  except  where the space below the
      street floor does not exceed five feet in height.
        k. Columns supporting the roof of a one-story building shall have  the
      same  fire-resistance  rating  as  required  for a column supporting one
      floor in a building of the same construction class.
        l. Members supporting loads of not more than two floors or  one  floor
      and a roof need not have a fire-resistance rating greater than the floor
      construction  fire-resistance  requirement  in  buildings  classified in
      occupancy groups G, H, and J-2, not including  unsprinklered  spaces  of
      other  occupancies,  and  in  fully  sprinklered  buildings in occupancy
      groups E and J-1.
        m. See subdivision (c) of section 27-987 of article one of  subchapter
      eighteen  of  this chapter for additional impact resistance requirements
      applicable to certain elevator enclosures.
    
    
    
    
    
    
    

Section 27-272

Section 27-272 ::    
        
     
        § 27-272 False designation. No building or space shall be designated a
      given  construction class unless it conforms to the minimum requirements
      for that class;  and  no  building  or  space  shall  be  posted,  used,
      designated,  or  advertised  as  of a given construction class unless it
      complies with the minimum requirements of this code for that class.
    
    
    
    
    
    
    

Section 27-273
--------------

Section 27-273 ::    
        
     
        §  27-273  Minimum  requirements.  When  a  class  of  construction is
      utilized which is superior to that  required  for  any  particular  use,
      nothing  in this code shall be construed to require full compliance with
      the requirements for  the  higher  class;  the  designated  construction
      classification  of  the  building  or  space shall be that of the lesser
      classification, unless all of the requirements for the higher class  are
      met.
