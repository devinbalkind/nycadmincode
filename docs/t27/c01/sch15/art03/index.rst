        §  27-870  Chimney  connector  construction. Chimney connectors except
      those serving incinerators shall be constructed of galvanized  steel  of
      thickness  conforming  to  the  requirements listed in subdivision(a) of
      this section or of equivalent materials.  Cleanout  doors  of  the  same
      material  as  the  connector or other equivalent means shall be provided
      for the cleaning of connectors. Tile pipe shall not be used as a chimney
      connector.
        (a) Thickness of metal. The thickness of galvanized steel for  chimney
      connectors shall be not less than that given in table 15-7.

        (b)  General. All chimney connectors shall be as short and as straight
      as possible consistent with their use and the required draft conditions.
      No chimney connector shall pass through a floor or ceiling construction.
    
    
    
    
    
    
    

Section 27-871

Section 27-871 ::    
        
     
        §  27-871 Chimney connection. In entering a flue in a masonry or metal
      chimney, the chimney connector shall  be  installed  above  the  extreme
      bottom  to  avoid  stoppage  and  in  such manner or by such means as to
      prevent the chimney connector from entering so far as  to  restrict  the
      space  between its end and the opposite wall of the chimney. The chimney
      connector shall be firmly attached or inserted into a  thimble  or  slip
      joint  to prevent it from falling out of place. All connectors shall fit
      tightly. Chimney connections to any flue shall be limited to one  floor.
      Two  or  more  chimney  connectors  may be joined to a single connection
      provided that the chimney connectors are on one floor level and the flue
      is of sufficient size to serve all  of  the  equipment  thus  connected.
      Chimney  connectors  shall  be  inspected  at  the  time  of the initial
      installation by the commissioner  or  by  a  duly  authorized  insurance
      company as provided in section two hundred four of the labor law.

Section 27-872 ::    
        
     
        §   27-872   Chimney   connector   clearances.  (a)  From  combustible
      construction. The minimum distance between the chimney connector and any
      combustible material or construction shall be:
        (1) eighteen  inches  for  chimney  connectors  from  low  temperature
      equipment.
        (2)  thirty-six  inches for chimney connectors from medium temperature
      and high temperature equipment.
        (b) Reduced  clearances.  The  above  clearances  may  be  reduced  as
      outlined in table 15-8 in accordance with the type of protection applied
      to the combustible material or construction.
     
                          TABLE 15-8 REDUCED CLEARANCES FOR
                               CHIMNEY CONNECTORS WITH
                       SPECIFIED FORM OF PROTECTION (1,2,3,4)
                                                 Where the required clearance
                Type of Protection                   with no protection is:
      Applied to the combustible material       36 in.  18 in.  9 in.  6 in.
      and covering all surfaces within
      the distance specified as the required
      clearance with no protection.
      Thicknesses are minimum.
        (a) 0.027 in. (23 gauge) sheet
      metal spaced out 1 in.                    18 in.   9 in.  4 in.  2 in.
        (b) 3 1/2 in. thick masonry wall
      spaced out 1 in. and adequately tied
      to the wall being protected.              18 in.   9 in.  4 in.  2 in.
        (See Note 4.)
        (c) 0.027 in. (23 gauge) sheet
      metal on 1 in. mineral wool batts
      reinforced with wire or equivalent
      spaced out in 1 in.                       12 in.   3 in.  2 in.  2 in.
     
      Notes:
        1. Spacers and ties shall be of noncombustible material.
        2.  All  methods  of  protection  require adequate ventilation between
      protective material and adjacent combustible walls and ceilings.
        3. Mineral wool batts (blanket or board) shall have a minimum  density
      of 8 lb. per cu. ft. and a minimum melting point of 1500°F.
        4.  If  a  single wall connector passes through the masonry wall there
      shall be at least 1/2 in. open ventilated airspace between the connector
      and the masonry.
