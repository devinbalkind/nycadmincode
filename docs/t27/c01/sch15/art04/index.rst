      be constructed in accordance with the following requirements:
        (a) Directly connected. When  directly  connected  to  the  combustion
      chamber  of  an  incinerator,  the chutes shall be gas tight with smooth
      linings and shall conform to the following:
        (1) They shall be constructed in accordance with the requirements  for
      medium temperature chimneys.
        (2)  They  shall  extend  through the building roof and be open to the
      outer air. The opening shall be equal to the required chute size at  the
      top floor.
        (3)  If  a  roof  damper  is  used  it  shall  be  constructed to open
      automatically under conditions of excessive pressure or temperature. The
      roof  damper  shall  be  electrically  interlocked  with  the  auxiliary
      burners.
        (4)  Each  charging  chute  shall be provided with a spark arrester of
      corrosion resistive, noncombustible construction in  which  the  maximum
      size  of  mesh  opening  shall not exceed three-quarters of an inch. The
      cross-sectional free area of such arrester shall be not less  than  that
      of  the  inside  of the chute to which it is attached. The height of the
      spark arrester shall be such that there will be a minimum of twenty-four
      square feet of total free area provided for  a  chute  height  to  sixty
      feet;  thirty-six  square feet for a chute height from sixty-one feet to
      one hundred twenty feet; and forty-four square feet  for  chute  heights

        (d)  Charging doors. Charging doors, service openings, or hopper doors
      for chutes may be located in separate rooms or compartments enclosed  in
      non-combustible  walls or partitions, floors, and ceilings having a fire
      resistance rating of at least one hour and a self-closing fire door with
      a three-quarter-hour fire-protection rating. Service openings shall,  in
      no  case, have a free area of more than one-third of the cross-sectional
      free area of the chute to which they  give  access.  All  such  openings
      shall  be  substantially constructed of steel or the equivalent metal of
    
      sufficient thickness to prevent distortion or  other  damage  in  normal
      usage.  The  door shall be provided with counterweights, door checks, or
      other equivalent means for automatically closing after use and where the
      chute is connected directly to the combustion chamber of an incinerator,
      the  door shall be so constructed that the chute is closed off while the
      hopper is being loaded. No part of the door shall project into the chute
      at any time. The minimum height  of  charging  door  openings  shall  be
      eleven inches, and the minimum width shall be thirteen inches.
        (e)  When  charging  chutes  are  located  in  multiple  dwellings, in
      addition to the requirements of this subchapter,  the  chutes  shall  be
      constructed  in  accordance  with  the requirements for noise control of
      chutes in subchapter twelve of this chapter.
