Section 27-856 ::    
        
     
        §  27-856  General requirements. (a) Equipment requiring chimneys. All
      gas-burning equipment that produces flue gas temperatures in  excess  of
      five  hundred  fifty  degrees  Fahrenheit or four hundred eighty degrees
      Fahrenheit above room temperature, and all solid and liquid fuel-burning
      equipment,  shall  be  connected  to  chimneys  that  conform   to   the
      requirements of this subchapter.
        (b)  Chimney  construction.  Unlisted chimneys shall be constructed of
      steel, brick, masonry units, concrete,  concrete  units,  or  equivalent
      materials.  Chimneys  shall  be  of  adequate  structural strength, with
      resistance suitable for the temperatures to which they may be  subjected
      and   resistive  to  the  corrosive  action  of  gases.  For  structural
      requirements, see subchapters ten and eleven of this chapter.
        (c) Separation of flues. Whenever more  than  one  flue  is  installed
      within  a  chimney, the lining of each flue shall be separated, one from
      the other, as follows:
        (1) In low temperature chimneys with fire  clay  flue  linings:  by  a
      wythe  of  cement  grout  at  least  one  inch thick or other equivalent
      method.
        (2) In medium temperature and high temperature chimneys: by a division
      wall of brick or concrete at least three and three-quarters inches thick
      or other equivalent method. The separation  between  flue  linings  thus
      established  shall  in  all  cases be adequate to give stability for the
      chimney construction as required by subchapter ten of this chapter.
        (d) Test run. All new chimneys shall be  test  run  by  the  applicant
      under  operating  conditions to demonstrate fire safety and the complete
      exhausting of smoke and the products of combustion to the outer air. The
      results of such test run shall be certified as correct by the  applicant
      and shall be submitted in writing to the department.
        (e) Requirement of a smoke test. Whenever required by the commissioner
      after  an inspection has been made of the chimney, a smoke test shall be
      made as outlined in section 27-868 of this article. Any faults or  leaks
      found  shall  be  corrected.  Such  smoke  test  shall be witnessed by a
      representative of the commissioner. In lieu  thereof,  the  commissioner
      may accept the test report of an architect or engineer in which case the
      test shall be subject to the provisions for controller inspection except
      that the architect or engineer may be retained by the contractor.

--------------

Section 27-859 ::    
        
     
        §  27-859 Chimney heights and locations. (a) Low temperature chimneys.
      Low temperature chimneys shall extend at  least  three  feet  above  the
      highest  construction, such as a roof ridge, parapet wall, or penthouse,
      within ten feet of the chimney outlet, whether the  construction  is  on
      the  same  building as the chimney or on another building. However, such
      constructions do not include other chimneys, vents, or  open  structural
      framing. Any chimney located beyond ten feet from such construction, but
      not  more  than  the  distance  determined  in  subdivision  (d) of this
      section, shall be at least as high as the construction.
        (b) Medium temperature chimneys.  Medium  temperature  chimneys  shall
      extend  at least ten feet above the highest construction, such as a roof
      ridge, or parapet wall or penthouse within twenty feet  of  the  chimney
      outlet,  whether the construction is on the same building as the chimney
      or on another building. However, such constructions do not include other
      chimneys, and vents. Any chimney located beyond  twenty-feet  from  such
      constructions  but  not more than the distance determined in subdivision
      (d) of this section, shall be at least as high as the construction.
        (c) High temperature chimneys. High temperature chimneys shall  extend
      at least twenty feet above the highest construction, such as roof ridge,
      parapet  wall,  penthouse, or other obstruction within fifty feet of the
      chimney outlet, whether the construction is on the same building as  the
      chimney  or  in  another  building.  However,  such constructions do not
      include other chimneys, vents, or open structural framing.  Any  chimney
      located  beyond  fifty feet from such construction but not more than the
      distance determined in subdivision (d) of  this  section,  shall  be  at
      least as high as the construction.
        (d)  Formula.  The following formula shall be used for determining the
      distances referred to in subdivisions (a), (b) and (c) of this section:
     
                                  D = F (sq.rt.) A
     
      where: D = Distance, in ft., measured from the  center  of  the  chimney
                   outlet to the nearest edge of the construction.
             F = Value determined from table 15-1.
             A = Free area, in sq. in., of chimney flue space.

Section 27-860
--------------

Section 27-860 ::    
        
     
        §  27-860  Adjoining  chimneys.  (a) Responsibility of owner of taller
      building. Whenever a building is  erected,  enlarged,  or  increased  in
      height  so  that any portion of such building, except chimneys or vents,
      extends higher than the  top  of  any  previously  constructed  chimneys
      within one hundred feet, the owner of such new or altered building shall
      have  the  responsibility of altering such chimneys to make them conform
      with the requirements of section 27-859 of this article. A chimney  that
      is no longer connected with a fireplace or combustion or other equipment
      for which a chimney was required, shall be exempt from this requirement.
      Such  alterations shall be accomplished by one of the following means or
      a combination thereof:
        (1) Carry  up  the  previously  constructed  chimneys  to  the  height
      required in section 27-859 of this article.
        (2) Offset such chimneys to a distance beyond that required in section
      27-859  of  this article from the new or altered building, provided that
      the new location of the outlet of the  offset  chimney  shall  otherwise
      comply with the requirements of this subchapter.
        (b) Protection of draft. After the alteration of a chimney as required
      by  subdivision  (a)  of this section, it shall be the responsibility of
      the owner of the new or  altered  building  to  provide  any  mechanical
      equipment  or  devices  necessary  to  maintain  the proper draft in the
      equipment.
        (c) Written notification. The owner of the  new  or  altered  building
      shall  notify  the  owner  of  the building affected in writing at least
      forty-five days before starting the work required  and  request  written
      consent  to  do  such  work.  Such  notice shall be accompanied by plans
      indicating the manner in which the proposed alterations are to be made.
        (d) Approval. The plans and method of alteration shall be  subject  to
      the approval of the commissioner.
        (e)  Refusal of consent. If consent is not granted by the owner of the
      previously constructed building to do the alteration  work  required  by
      subdivisions (a) and (b) of this section such owner shall signify his or
      her  refusal  in writing to the owner of the new or altered building and
      to the commissioner; and the owner of the new or  altered  building  has
      submitted  plans that conform to the requirements of this section, he or
      she shall thereupon be released from any responsibility for  the  proper
      operation  of  the  equipment  due  to  loss of draft and for any health
      hazard or nuisance that may occur as a result  of  the  new  or  altered
      building.  Such  responsibilities  shall then be assumed by the owner of
      the previously constructed building. Likewise, should such owner neglect
      to grant consent within forty-five days from the date of written request
      or fail to signify his or her refusal, he or she shall then  assume  all
      responsibilities as prescribed above.
        (f)  Procedure.  It shall be the obligation of the owner of the new or
      altered building to:
        (1) Schedule this work so as to create a minimum of disturbance to the
      occupants of the affected building.
        (2) Provide such essential services as are normally  supplied  by  the
      equipment while it is out of service.
        (3) Where necessary, support such extended chimneys and equipment from
      this building or to carry up such chimneys within his or her building.
        (4)  Provide  for  the maintenance, repair, and/or replacement of such
      extensions and added equipment.
        (5) Make such alterations of the same material as the original chimney
      so as to maintain the same quality  and  appearance,  except  where  the
      owner  of  the  chimney  affected  shall  give  his or her consent to do
      otherwise. All work shall be done in such fashion  as  to  maintain  the
      architectural esthetics of the existing building.
    
        (g)  Existing  violations.  Any  existing violations on the previously
      constructed equipment shall be corrected by the owner of  the  equipment
      before  any equipment is added or alterations made at the expense of the
      owner of the new or altered building.
        (h)  The  commissioner  may  grant  a  variance in accordance with the
      provisions of section 27-107 of article one of subchapter  one  of  this
      chapter.

Section 27-861 ::    
        
     
        §  27-861  Metal chimneys. (a) Exterior metal chimneys. Exterior metal
      chimneys constructed of steel shall be of adequate thickness  to  resist
      all  applied  loads  specified  in  subchapter nine of this chapter, but
      shall not be less than the thickness required in table 15-4.
        (b) Clearances for exterior metal chimneys. Metal chimneys erected  on
      the  exterior  of a building shall have sufficient clearance from a wall
      or frame of combustible construction  to  satisfy  the  requirements  of
      table  15-2  and  to permit inspection and maintenance operations on the
      chimney, and shall comply with the following minimum requirements:
        (1) Exterior metal chimneys over  eighteen  inches  in  diameter,  for
      equipment  of  any  operating  temperature, shall have a clearance of at
      least four inches, and those eighteen inches or less in  diameter  shall
      have  a  clearance  of  at  least two inches from a building wall of any
      combustible construction.
        (2) No portion of an exterior  metal  chimney  shall  be  nearer  than
      twenty-four  inches  to  any  door  or window or to any exit, or located
      where it would be  readily  accessible  to  the  public,  unless  it  is
      insulated  or  shielded  to avoid injury to any person coming in contact
      with the chimney.

      ========================================================================
     
        (c) Enclosure of interior metal chimneys:
        (1) Every interior  metal  chimney  or  part  thereof  erected  within
      buildings  shall  be  enclosed with noncombustible construction having a
      fire resistance rating of not less than that prescribed in table 15-3 in
      all stories above the one in  which  the  equipment  served  thereby  is
      located.  Where  the metal chimney passes through a combustible roof, it
      shall be guarded by a noncombustible ventilating thimble  of  galvanized
      metal  or  equivalent noncombustible material that extends at least nine
      inches below and above the roof construction. The thimbles shall be of a
      size to provide clearances on all sides of the metal chimney of at least
      six inches for low temperature equipment and at  least  eighteen  inches
      for  medium  and  high  temperature  equipment  as defined in subchapter
      fourteen of this chapter. However, if the metal chimney is insulated and
      protected to prevent a  temperature  of  more  than  two  hundred  fifty
      degrees Fahrenheit on its exterior surface, the thimble clearance may be
      reduced by fifty percent.
        (2)  The enclosure around a metal chimney shall provide a space on all
      sides of the chimney to permit inspection  and  repair  for  the  entire
      chimney  height.  When  metal  chimneys  have  a  minimum  dimension  of
      twenty-four  inches  in  diameter  and  are  completely  jacketed   with
      noncombustible insulating material within the required enclosure, access
      to permit inspection and repair shall not be required.
        (3)  The  enclosing  construction shall be of noncombustible materials
      and shall have a fire resistance rating as required in  table  15-3  and
      shall  be without openings, except access openings equipped with opening
      protectives  constructed  in  accordance  with   the   requirements   of
      subchapter  five  of  this  chapter, at floor levels where necessary for
      complete inspection purposes.
    
        (4) The required  fire  resistance  ratings  of  table  15-3  for  the
      enclosure  of  a medium or high temperature metal chimney may be reduced
      by one hour if the chimney is insulated with an insulation adequate  for
      the  temperature  of  the  chimney  and  having at least a one hour fire
      resistance rating at all sections of the insulation.

            construction of enclosures for metal chimneys.
     
        (d) Prohibited location. No interior metal chimney shall be carried up
      inside a ventilating duct unless such duct is constructed as required by
      this subchapter for metal chimneys, and only  when  such  duct  is  used
      solely  for  exhaust  venting  the  room or space in which the equipment
      served by the metal chimney is located.  Metal  chimneys  shall  not  be
      installed in air supply ducts.
        (e)  Unlisted  metal  chimneys  serving  residential  type or low heat
      appliances and producing flue gas having a temperature  below  350°F  at
      the  entrance to the chimney at full load or partial load shall be lined
      with acid and condensate resistant refractory material,  or  constructed
      of suitable stainless steel, or otherwise protected so as to minimize or
      prevent  condensation  or  corrosion  damage  as  required  in reference
      standard RS 15-14.
        (f) Steel chimneys for exterior use shall  be  insulated  and  weather
      sheathed  to maintain flue surface temperatures above the acid dew point
      in all parts of the system in accordance with subdivision (b) of section
      27-854.
        (g) Steel chimneys for interior  use  shall  be  insulated  to  ensure
