        ยง  27-892 Construction. Vent connectors for conversion burners without
      draft hoods, or other gas-fired equipment without draft hoods, shall  be
      constructed  of materials having resistance to corrosion and temperature
      not less than that of no. 24 galvanized sheet gauge steel.
        (a) Vent connectors used for gas-fired equipment  having  draft  hoods
      and  for  conversion burners having draft hoods, shall be constructed of
      type B gas vent material or materials having resistance to corrosion and
      temperature not less than that of no. 26 galvanized sheet gauge steel.
        (b) The vent connector between the equipment and the vertical gas vent
      or chimney shall have the greatest possible initial rise consistent with
      the headroom available in the  equipment  area  and  with  the  required
      clearance  to  combustible  material.  The  horizontal  run  of the vent
      connector shall be as short as  possible  and  the  equipment  shall  be
      located  as  near  the  gas  vent or chimney as practicable. The maximum
      length of an uninsulated horizontal run  of  vent  connector  shall  not
      exceed seventy-five percent of the height of the gas vent or chimney.
        (c)   No   vent   connector   shall  pass  through  floor  or  ceiling
      construction.

      connectors  to combustible materials shall not be less than those listed
      in table 15-10.
        (b) Reduced clearances. These  clearances  may  be  reduced  when  the
      combustible construction is protected as provided in table 15-11.

      should  be  measured  from  the  outer  surface  of the appliance to the
      combustible material disregarding any intervening protection applied  to
      the combustible material.
        b. Applied to the combustible material unless otherwise specified and
      covering  all  surfaces  within  the  distance specified as the required
      clearance with no protection. Thicknesses are minimum.
        c. Spacers shall be on noncombustible material.

        ยง 27-894 Thimbles. (a) When passing through combustible constructions,
      bent  connectors  constructed  of  type  B  gas  vent  material shall be
      installed  so  that  the  clearances  required  by  the   standard   are
      maintained.
        (b)  Vent  connections  made  of single-wall metal pipe shall not pass
      through any combustible walls or partitions unless they are  guarded  at
      the  point  of passage by ventilated metal thimbles not smaller than the
      following:
        (1) For equipment conforming to standards --  four  inches  larger  in
      diameter than the vent connector.
        (2)  For equipment having draft hoods -- six inches larger in diameter
      than the vent connector.
        (3) For equipment without draft  hoods  --  twelve  inches  larger  in
      diameter than the vent connector.

Section 27-895 ::    
        
     
        ยง  27-895  Size of connectors. The vent connector shall not be smaller
      than the size of the flue  collar  or  the  draft  hood  outlet  of  the
      gas-fired  equipment. Where a single item of equipment has more than one
      draft hood outlet, the vent connector shall equal the combined  area  of
      the  draft  hood  outlets for which it acts as a common connector to the
      gas vent or chimney.
