      standpipe  systems  shall  have  a primary water supply available at all
      times at every hose outlet, or made  available  automatically  when  the
      hose  valve  at  any  outlet is opened. Such primary water supply may be
      from one or more gravity tanks from a pressure tank  or  tanks,  from  a
      direct  connection  to a city water main, from a connection to a private
      water main, or from an automatic fire pump.
        (b)  Method  of  providing  water  supply   for   standpipe   systems.
      Combinations  of  two or more of the following methods shall be used; in
      using such combinations, the siamese connections shall be considered  as
      a source of supply.
        (1) Direct connections of standpipes to the city water system provided
      one of the following conditions is met:
        a.  A  statement  furnished  by  the  bureau  of  water  supply of the
      department of environmental  protection  indicates  a  pressure  in  the
      street main that is capable of maintaining a static pressure of at least
      fifteen  psig.  at the highest hose outlet between the hours of eight a.
      m. and five p. m.  on a normal working day  when  a  street  level  fire
      hydrant  within  two hundred fifty feet of the building is supplied from
      the same street main and  is  discharging  at  least  five  hundred  gpm
      through a two and one-half inch hydrant butt.
        b. For buildings forty feet or less in height with an area of not more
      than  twenty thousand square feet per floor, there is a four inch direct
      connection to the street main that is fed two ways or there  is  a  four
      inch  direct connection to each of two street mains on two street fronts
      so installed that shutting off one service will not interfere  with  the
      supply of the other, and there is sufficient pressure in the street main
      to  maintain  a  minimum  static  pressure  of  twenty-five psig. at the
      highest  required  hose  outlet  and  the  department  of  environmental
      protection states that the required street pressure is available.

      pressure between seventy and eighty psig. The  automatic  control  shall
      also maintain the proper air-to-water ratio in the pressure tank.
        d.  Pressure  tanks shall be supplied with water through a fixed pipe,
      independent of the standpipe riser, and at least two inches in size. The
      water supply and connection shall be capable of supplying the tank at  a
      rate  of  at  least  sixty-five gpm without reducing the pressure in the
      tank. The tank shall have a fixed water level plate on the end  opposite
      the gauge glass, or other equivalent indicating device.
        (5)  An  automatic fire pump shall be acceptable as the primary supply
      to the system provided:
        a. The building is three hundred feet high or less, or if the building
      is higher than three hundred feet, the automatic fire pump is used  only
      for  the  lower  three  hundred feet. The zones above three hundred feet
      shall be supplied by either a gravity tank conforming to paragraph three
      of subdivision (b) of this section or  a  pressure  tank  conforming  to
      paragraph  four of subdivision (b) of this section and in addition shall
      be supplied by the manual fire pump required by section 27-946  of  this

      least  twenty-five  but  not  exceeding  seventy psig (above the normal)
      static pressure at the highest hose outlet within the zone  supplied  by
      the pump plus the frictional resistance from the pump to the outlet at a
      flow of five hundred gpm.
        c. The electrical power to the pump is connected to the street side of
      the building service switch.
        (c)  High  and  low risers and cross connections in standpipe systems.
      When tanks are used for the primary water supply, the standpipe  systems
      may use separate riser systems serving, respectively, low and high parts
      of  the  building.  Separate  gravity tanks or pressure tanks may supply
      each zone, but in every case the standpipe system shall be  so  designed
      that  every hose outlet of the entire system can be supplied through the
      required cross connections from every siamese connection and from  every
