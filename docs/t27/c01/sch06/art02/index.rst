Article 2 - DETERMINATION OF EXIT REQUIREMENTS
==============================================

Section 27-357
--------------

Section 27-357 ::    
        
     
        ยง 27-357 Exit requirements. The determination of exit requirements for
      a building shall be based upon the occupancy group classification of the
      building,  the  number of occupants, the floor area, the travel distance
      to an exit, and the capacity of the exits, as provided in table 6-1  and
      herein. Every floor of a building shall be provided with exit facilities
      for  its  occupant  load.  The  occupant  loads  of  floors shall not be
      cumulative for the purpose of designing vertical exits, except where one
      floor is used by another as a means of egress. Vertical  exits  provided
      from  any  floor  above  grade may serve simultaneously all floors above
      grade, and vertical exits provided from any floor below grade may  serve
      simultaneously all floors below grade.
        (a)  Mixed  occupancy.  When a building is classified in more than one
      occupancy group in accordance with the provisions of section  27-239  of
      article  two  of subchapter three of this chapter, the exit requirements
      for the entire  building  shall  be  determined  on  the  basis  of  the
      occupancy  group  having  the  strictest  exit requirements, or the exit
      requirements for each building section shall be determined separately.
        (b)  Incidental  occupancies.  When  a  building  contains  incidental
      occupancies  classified  in occupancy groups other than that under which
      the building is classified, the exit requirements for the floor on which
      such occupancies occur shall be based upon those of the occupancy  group
      under  which  the  building  is  classified;  but  the  access  and exit
      requirements for the  incidental  occupancy  shall  be  based  upon  the
      occupancy group classification of the incidental occupancy.
        (c)  Multiple  occupancy  or use. Where a building, floor, or space is
      used for multiple purposes involving different activities  at  different
      times,  that  occupancy involving the greatest number of occupants shall
      be used in determining the exit requirements.
        (d) Building access. All buildings classified in other than  occupancy
      groups  A,  mechanical  and  electrical  equipment  rooms and boiler and
      furnace rooms of D-2 or J-3 shall have at  least  one  primary  entrance
      accessible  to  and  usable  by  individuals  who  use wheelchairs. Such
      entrance shall provide access to a level that makes elevators  available
      in  buildings  where  elevators  are  provided.  Where ramps are used to
      comply with this requirement, they shall have a slope not  greater  than
      one  in twelve, and shall otherwise conform to the provisions of section
      27-377 and reference standard RS 4-6.
        The commissioner may waive the requirements of  this  section  in  the
      alteration  of  buildings existing on the effective date of this code in
      accordance with section 27-292.6 of this code.
     
        (For Table 6-1 see chapter 839 of the laws of 1986)
     
                               FOOTNOTES TO TABLE 6-1
        a. For method of measurement see subdivision (c) of section 27-360  of
      this article.
        b. Reduce  listed  capacity of ramps by twenty-five percent when slope
      exceeds 1 in 10.
        c. Except for public garages. (See article ten of subchapter seven  of
      this chapter.)
        d. There  shall  not  be  more  than  one  classroom on each side of a
      corridor between an exit and the end of the corridor (dead end).
        e. Applies to corridors serving classrooms. Other corridors shall have
      a minimum width of forty-four inches.
        f. Applies to corridors serving patients. Other corridors shall have a
      minimum width of forty-four inches.
        g. There shall be no patient bedrooms between an exit and the  end  of
      the corridor (dead end).
    
        h. See  subdivision  (d)  of  section  27-369  of article five of this
      subchapter for permissible increase.
        i. See section 27-369 of article five of this subchapter.
        j. See section 27-370 of article five of this subchapter.
        k. See section 27-378 of article five of this subchapter.
        m. Where  a  door opening is divided by mullions into two or more door
      openings, each such opening shall be measured  separately  in  computing
      the number of units of exit width.

Section 27-358 ::    
        
     
        ยง  27-358  Occupant  load.  The  number  of  occupants  for  whom exit
      facilities shall be provided shall be  established  either  (1)  by  the
      actual  number  of  occupants  for  whom  each occupied space, floor, or
      building, as the  case  may  be,  is  designed,  or  (2)  by  using  the
      appropriate  occupant-area  ratios  from table 6-2, whichever is larger.
      The occupant load of any space shall include the occupant  load  of  all
      spaces that discharge through it in order to gain access to an exit.

      Notes:
        C--capacity  of  all  passenger vehicles that can be unloaded simulta-
      neously.
    
        D--designed number of seats or occupants.
     
        (a)  Unlisted occupancies. Where data regarding the sq. ft. per person
      for an occupancy is not listed in table 6-2, the occupant load shall  be
      established  by an architect or engineer, subject to the approval of the
      commissioner.
        (b) Modifications.
        (1) When the actual occupant load of any space will  be  significantly
      lower  than  that  listed in table 6-2, the commissioner may establish a
      lower basis for the determination of the occupant load.
        (2) When a building  existing  on  December  sixth,  nineteen  hundred
      sixty-eight  is  altered or changed in occupancy or use so as to require
      enlarged exit facilities, the commissioner may authorize the  alteration
      or change in occupancy or use without an enlargement of exit facilities,
      provided  the  occupant  load  is  limited  to  that accommodated by the
      existing exit facilities as determined by the provisions of  this  code,
      and  the building or space is posted accordingly with a sign. Such signs
      shall be at least twelve inches in width and sixteen inches  in  height.
      The  lettering  shall be red on a white background. The letters shall be
      not less than one inch high and the  numerals  not  less  than  one  and
      one-quarter inches high.
        (c)  Nonsimultaneous  occupancy.  The occupant load of toilets, locker
      rooms, meeting rooms, storage rooms, employee  cafeterias,  and  similar
      rooms or spaces that are not occupied at the same time as other rooms or
      spaces on the same floor of a building, may be omitted from the occupant
      load  calculation  of  the floor on which they are located to the extent
      that such spaces serve occupied rooms on the same floor.
    
    
    
    
    
    
    

Section 27-359
--------------

Section 27-359 ::    
        
     
        ยง  27-359  Capacity  of  exits.  The  capacity  of  exits  and  access
      facilities shall be measured in units of width of twenty-two inches, and
      the number of persons per unit of  width  shall  be  determined  by  the
      occupancy  group classification and type of exit as listed in table 6-1.
      Fractions of a unit of width  less  than  twelve  inches  shall  not  be
      credited.  Where  twelve  inches  or  more are added to one or more full
      units  of  width,  one-half  unit  of  width  may  be  credited.   Where
      computations  of  total required width give fractional results, the next
      larger integral number of exit units or integral number  plus  one-half,
      shall  be  used. A fraction less than one-half may be neglected in cases
      where such fraction constitutes less than ten  per  cent  of  the  total
      required number of units. Notwithstanding any of the above computations,
      no  exit  or  access  facility  shall be narrower than the minimum width
      requirements specified in table 6-1, or elsewhere in this code.
    
    
    
    
    
    
    

Section 27-360
--------------

Section 27-360 ::    
        
     
        ยง  27-360 Travel distance. (a) General requirement. The maximum travel
      distance from the most remote point in any room or space to  the  center
      of  a  door opening directly on an open exterior space, a vertical exit,
      an interior stair, an exit passageway or to a horizontal exit shall  not
      be greater than the limit specified in table 6-1 for the occupancy group
      classification of the room or space.
        (b)  Travel distance within dwelling units. In buildings classified in
      occupancy groups J-1 and J-2,  the  maximum  travel  distance  from  the
      centerline  of  a  door  from  any habitable room within a dwelling unit
      either to the centerline of a door opening  on  a  corridor  or  to  the
      center  of  a  door  opening  on an exit shall not be greater than forty
      feet, except that for buildings classified in  occupancy  group  J-2  of
      construction  class  I-A,  the  distance may be increased to fifty feet.
      Such travel distances shall be included in the maximum  travel  distance
      established in subdivision (a) of this section.
        (c) Measurement. Travel distance shall be measured along a natural and
      unobstructed  path of travel. Where the path of travel is over an access
      stair, it shall be measured along an inclined straight line through  the
      center of the outer edge of each tread.
