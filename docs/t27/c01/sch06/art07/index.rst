Section 27-383 ::    
        
     
        §  27-383 Requirements. (a) Exit signs. Except in occupancy groups J-2
      and J-3, the location of every exit on every  floor  and  every  opening
      from  a  room  classified in occupancy group J-1 and containing cubicles
      shall be clearly indicated by exit signs. Such signs shall be placed  at
      an  angle  with  the  exit opening if such placement is required for the
      signs to serve their purpose. In long corridors, in  open  floor  areas,
      and  in  all  other situations where the location of the exit may not be
      readily visible or understood, directional signs shall  be  provided  to
      serve as guides from all portions of the corridor or floor.
        (b)  Exit path markings in high rise office buildings and in occupancy
      group E high rise buildings. On and after July 1,  2006  all  high  rise
      office  buildings  and  all  high rise buildings classified in occupancy
      group E shall have exit path markings conforming  to  this  subdivision.
      This  provision  shall  be  retroactive  and  shall  apply  to buildings
      constructed on and after such date and to buildings in existence on such
      date. All exit path markings required herein shall  be  of  an  approved
      photoluminescent  material.  The  markings shall be washable, non-toxic,
      non radioactive, and if subjected to fire  must  be  self  extinguishing
      when the flame is removed.
        (1)  All  doors  opening  to  corridors,  to  an  exit,  or to an exit
      passageway, shall be marked with the word "exit".
        (2)  Within  exit  stairs,  horizontal  extensions  in  exit   stairs,
      horizontal  exits,  supplemental  vertical  exits  and exit passageways,
      except within street level lobbies, there shall be directional markings.
        (3) Required markings for exit paths shall comply with  the  technical
      standards  for installation and placement to be set forth in a reference
      standard. Such reference standard shall be designated RS 6-1  and  shall
      be adopted on or before January 1, 2006.

        §  27-383.1 Additional requirements for high rise office buildings and
      occupancy group E high rise buildings. In high rise office buildings and
      in occupancy group E high rise buildings:
        (a) Illuminated exit signs  complying  with  section  27-386  of  this
      subchapter  shall  be placed in stairwells with horizontal extensions to
      indicate the transition from vertical to  horizontal  direction  and  at
      turns along the horizontal path.
        (b)  A supplementary sign complying with sections 27-394 and 27-395 of
      this subchapter, except that the lettering  and  numerals  shall  be  at
      least  one  inch  high,  indicating  the location of a recessed re-entry
      door, shall be securely attached on the wall of the landing  that  faces
      the evacuee on the stairs.
        (c)  In  stairs where there is no entry or exiting from such stair for
      more than four floors, a sign complying with sections 27-394 and 27-395,
      except that the lettering and numerals shall be at least one inch  high,
      shall  be  securely  attached  at the beginning of the descent into such
      portion of the stair on the wall of the landing that faces  the  evacuee
      on  the  stairs  stating  the  location  of the next re-entry or exiting
      floor. On each floor within such portion of the stair a  sign  complying
      with  sections  27-392 and 27-395 shall be securely attached to the wall
      of the landing that faces the evacuee on the stairs  approximately  five
      feet above the floor indicating the floor number.
        (d) Signs shall be readily visible from the egress direction.
        (e)  High  rise office buildings and high rise buildings classified in

      date it is complete or under construction or where  an  application  for
      approval  of plans was filed with the department prior to such effective
      date and construction commenced within two years  after  such  effective
      date.

      general lighting and power circuits, taken off ahead of the main switch.
        (b) Existing high rise buildings classified in occupancy group C, D or

Section 27-385 ::    
        
     
        § 27-385 Exit sign design. Exit signs shall read only "exit" and shall
      be  of the externally lighted, internally lighted, or electroluminescent
      type, except that they may be nonilluminated in buildings  not  provided
      with artificial lighting.
        (a)  The  artificial  light  source  on externally lighted signs shall
      provide a red light, either by the use of an incandescent  colored  bulb
      or other visible red light source, so as to provide at least twenty-five
      foot  candles  on  the  exposed face of the sign. Visibility of the sign
      shall not be obscured by the location of the light source.
        (b) For internally lighted signs, the average  initial  brightness  of
      the  letters  shall  be  at least twenty-five ft. lamberts, and where an
      illuminated background is used, its average initial brightness shall  be
      at  least  two hundred fifty ft. lamberts. The light source shall not be
      modified or changed nor shall lamp life multipliers be  used  so  as  to
      reduce these brightness levels.
        (c)  The  letters  of  exit  signs  shall  be  red.  The background of
      externally lighted signs shall be white. The  background  of  internally
      lighted signs shall be either stenciled metal with a light gray or white
      color,  or translucent frosted, opal glass, slow-burning plastic, or the
      plastic edge-glow type with white plastic separators.  The  letters  for
      internally lighted signs shall be translucent red.
        (d)  The  letters  shall be block lettering at least four and one-half
      inches high with nine-sixteenths inch strokes, except in  buildings  and
      spaces  classified  in occupancy group F and J-1, where they shall be at
      least eight inches high with the strokes at least three-quarters  of  an
      inch wide.
        (e)  In  locations  where  breakage  may occur, exit signs shall be of
      shock resistant materials,  or  shall  otherwise  be  protected  against
      breakage.
        (f)  Except  for  buildings  not provided with artificial lighting and
      buildings which maintain one or more  auxiliary  systems  for  emergency
      exit  lighting  in the event of a public utility failure, there shall be
      either (1) an illuminated exit sign with the background thereon made  of
      an approved phosphorescent material or (2) a supplemental exit sign made
      of  an  approved  phosphorescent material with an opaque text and placed
      adjacent to or as close  as  possible  to  such  illuminated  sign.  The
      phosphorescent  material  after  exposure  to normal lighting conditions
      shall be capable of remaining visible in total darkness for a period  of
      at   least   eight  hours.  The  signs  shall  be  washable,  non-toxic,
      non-radioactive and if subjected to fire must be self-extinguishing when
      the flame is removed.

      article,  and  shall  read  "EXIT"  with  a  horizontal  arrow or arrows
      indicating the direction to the exit or exits. However, when  the  arrow
      is  below the letters, the letters may be three and three-eighths inches
      high and nine-sixteenths inch strokes, except in  buildings  and  spaces
      classified in occupancy group F where they shall be at least five inches
      high  with  nine-sixteenths  inch  strokes. The arrow or arrows shall be

      communication that is not an exit or that is not a way to an  exit,  but
      is  so located as to be mistaken for an exit, shall be identified with a
      sign reading "NOT AN EXIT", shall be identified by a sign indicating its
