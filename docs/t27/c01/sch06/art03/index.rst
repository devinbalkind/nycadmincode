        ยง 27-363 Remote location. (a) When more than one exit is required from
      a floor of a building, each such required exit shall be placed as remote
      from  the  others  as  is  practicable. Where this results in a distance
      between exits exceeding the maximum travel distances required by section
      27-357, additional remote vertical exits shall be provided.
        (b) In addition  to  the  requirements  of  subdivision  (a)  of  this
      section:
        (1)  For exits serving spaces classified in occupancy groups G or J-2,
      in no event shall such exits be less than fifteen feet distant from each
      other.
        (2) For exits serving spaces classified in other  occupancies,  in  no
      event  shall  such  distance  be  less than thirty feet or one-third the
      maximum  travel  distance  required  by  section  27-357,  whichever  is
      greater.
        (c) On any floor containing ten thousand square feet or more in a high
      rise  building classified in occupancy group E (office space), each exit
      that is required to be remote from another  exit  shall  not  share  any
      common  walls,  floors,  ceilings,  scissor  stair  assemblies, or other
      enclosures.

      continuous enclosure to discharge directly, or by way of a yard,  court,
      or  exit  passageway,  to  an  open  exterior space. When vertical exits
      serving floors above grade continue  in  the  same  enclosure  to  serve
      floors below grade, the portion of such vertical exits above grade shall
      be  separated  from  the  portion  below grade by construction having at
      least  a  one  hour  fire-resistance  rating,  with  three-quarter  hour
      self-closing  doors  opening  in  the  direction of exit travel from the
      floors below grade, except  that  buildings  classified  in  residential
      occupancy  group  J-3  and educational occupancy group G shall be exempt
      from this requirement.
