      buildings by one or more of the facilities listed below. Access and exit
      facilities not specifically covered in this section shall not be used to
      satisfy the exit requirements of this code. Fire escapes  shall  not  be
      permitted  on  new construction, with the exception of group homes. Fire
      escapes may be used as exits on buildings existing  on  December  sixth,

        (b)  In  group  homes all floors used by children shall have alternate
      exits remotely located from each other and  readily  accessible  to  the

        ยง  27-369  Corridors.  Corridors  shall be kept readily accessible and
      unobstructed at all times. Corridors shall be kept free  of  combustible
      contents  except that in buildings classified in occupancy groups G, H-1
      and H-2, combustible contents may be stored  in  noncombustible  lockers
      and  combustible  bulletin  boards meeting the requirements of table 5-4
      shall be permitted.
        (a) Capacity. The capacity and minimum width of corridors shall be  as
      listed  in  table  6-1. Width shall be measured in the clear between the
      narrowest points produced by any projections such as radiators, lockers,
      drinking fountains, or room or locker  door  swings,  except  that  such
      width  may  be  reduced by projections up to eighteen inches wide to the
      extent of two inches per unit of exit width if the total  area  of  such
      projections  does  not  exceed  five per cent of the area of the wall on
      which they occur.
        (b) Height. Corridors shall have a clear  height  of  seven  feet  six
      inches  for  at  least  seventy-five per cent of the floor area, with no
      point less than seven feet in height. No projection  below  the  ceiling
      shall be located so as to obstruct full view of exit signs.
        (c)  Length.  Corridors  shall  be  subdivided  by  smoke barriers, as
      defined in subchapter two, into the following lengths:
        Educational occupancy group G....................300 ft.
        Institutional occupancy groups H-1 and H-2.......150 ft.
        Residential occupancy groups J-1 and J-2.........150 ft.
        Where smoke barriers are penetrated by  doors,  such  doors  shall  be
      smoke  stop  doors in conformance with subdivision (c) of section 27-371
      of this article.
        (d) Dead ends. Dead ends in corridors  shall  not  exceed  the  length
      listed  in  table  6-1,  except  that  in  all  occupancy  groups except
      occupancy  group  H,  when  a  corridor  is   completely   enclosed   in
      construction having a two hour fire-resistance rating, with all corridor
      doors  being self-closing and having a fire protection rating of one and
      one-half hours, the permissible length of dead ends may be increased one
      hundred per cent above the length listed in table 6-1. Dead end distance
      shall be measured from the centerline of the door opening nearest to the
      closed end of the corridor to the center of an exit door opening, or the
      center of that point in the corridor where travel to two or  more  exits
      becomes available in two directions.
        (e)  Changes in level. Changes in level requiring less than two risers
      in a corridor shall be by a ramp complying with section 27-377  of  this
      article.  Risers  and  treads  shall  comply  with  the  requirements of
      subdivision (e) of section 27-375 of this article.
        (f) Exterior corridors. Exterior corridors shall be roofed, and  shall

      corridors  shall  be  protected  along  their  outer  side  by guards or
      parapets at least three feet six inches  high.  Openings  in  guards  or
      parapets shall be of such dimensions as to prevent the passage of a five
      inch  dia.  ball.  Where  the outer side of an exterior corridor is more
      than fifty per cent enclosed with solid material, it shall be treated as
      an interior corridor.
        (g) Balconies. Balconies may serve as a means of egress from  dwelling

      rating.  Such separation shall extend at least  three  feet  beyond  the
      outside  face  of  the  exterior  wall  of  the  building, although such
      projection  may  be  reduced  to  two  feet six inches provided that any
      window opening on each such balcony served by the fire separation  shall
      be at least two inches from such fire separation for every one inch that
      such  separation  is  less  than  thirty-six inches. An opening at least
      twenty inches wide shall be provided between the end of this  separation
      and  the  balcony  parapet or guard, and the opening shall be maintained
      free and unobstructed for the full height of the  balcony,  except  that
      privacy  screens  openable  from  either  side  may  be permitted in the
      opening.
        (4) Access from dwelling units to the balconies shall be through doors
      having glass panels at least two feet wide and four feet  high,  without
      muntins,  screens, or other obstructions to hinder entry by breaking the
      glass panels. The doors shall  be  lockable  only  from  the  inside  by
      devices  that can be easily released from the outside after breaking the

      through c of this paragraph:
        a. For buildings or spaces classified in occupancy group J-1 or J-2 of
      combustible construction group  II  exceeding  two  stories  in  height,
      except  for buildings not exceeding three stories in height and occupied
      exclusively by not more than one family on each story without  boarders,
      roomers  or lodgers, corridors shall be enclosed within fire separations
      providing a minimum fire-resistance rating of two hours.
        b. Corridor partitions may be omitted or may be constructed of unrated
      noncombustible material in buildings  in  occupancy  group  H-2  in  the
      following  instances: nurses' stations not exceeding three hundred fifty

      of  corridors.  In corridors required to have a one hour fire-resistance
      rating, fixed one-quarter inch wire glass panels may be installed in not
      more than twenty percent of the common wall between the corridor and any
      room or space, provided that  no  panel  exceeds  seven  hundred  twenty
      square inches in area; however, openings permitted in paragraph three of
      subdivision  (h)  of  section  27-370  of  this article may be permitted
      provided all of the  limitations  and  requirements  specified  in  that
      section  are  complied  with,  except  that  openings  in corridor walls
      serving as fire divisions required  to  have  a  fire-resistance  rating
      shall be limited to those specified in section 27-342 of article five of
      subchapter five of this chapter.
        (j)  Ventilation. Corridors shall be ventilated in accordance with the
      requirements of subchapter twelve of this chapter. Corridors  shall  not

      shall be not more than thirty-six inches nor  less  than  thirty  inches
      high  and  shall be of such design as to provide twenty-two inches clear
      width as the turnstile rotates. Each turnstile may be  credited  with  a
      capacity  of one unit of exit width. Not more than fifty per cent of the
      required exit capacity may be provided by turnstiles  at  any  location.
      The  balance of the required exit capacity shall be provided by swinging
      doors located within twenty feet  of  the  turnstiles.  Turnstiles  over
      thirty-six  inches  high  shall meet the applicable requirements of this

      percent of the required width of the landing or stair, or to  less  than
      the  width  of the door opening on them. The width of doors from a stair
      shall not be less than the number of units of exit  width  required  for
