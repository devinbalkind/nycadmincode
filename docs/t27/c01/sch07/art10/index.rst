      subdivision  (e)  of  this  section  shall  be  provided with mechanical
      ventilation according to one  of  or  a  combination  of  the  following
      methods:
        (1)  Air  exhaust at the rate of not less than one cfm per square foot
      of total floor area with properly designed means for air inflow.
        (2) Air supply at the rate of not less than one cfm per square foot of
      total floor area with properly designed means for air outflow.
        (3) Air exhaust or air supply at a  rate  sufficient  to  maintain  an
      average concentration of carbon monoxide not to exceed one hundred parts
      per one million parts of air for periods longer than one hour and with a
      maximum  concentration  at  any time not to exceed four hundred parts of
      carbon monoxide per one million  parts  of  air.  The  concentration  of
      carbon  monoxide  shall  be  determined  by periodic tests taken between
      three and four feet from the floor by means of approved carbon  monoxide
      detector  tubes  or  other  equivalent  means. This method of mechanical
      ventilation may be used only if the overall  design  includes  automatic
      ventilating  fan control by means of approved carbon monoxide monitoring
      devices or by other  approved  means  located  so  as  to  provide  full

      above.
        (d) No automotive service pits shall be installed in floors below  the
      street  floor. Pits shall have mechanical exhaust ventilation taken from
