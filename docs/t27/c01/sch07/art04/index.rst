Section 27-415

Section 27-415 ::    
        
     
        § 27-415 Laboratories. All laboratories required to register under the
      requirements  of  the  New  York  city health code shall comply with the
      following:
        (a) Construction. All buildings in which such laboratories occur shall
      be of noncombustible group I construction.
        (b)  Floors.  All  floors  shall  comply  with   the   fire-resistance
      requirements  for  the  class of construction, and provide the degree of
      radioactive resistance required by applicable city, state,  and  federal
      regulations.   A  finished  material  shall  be  applied  to  provide  a
      continuous nonporous surface which may be readily removed.
        (c) Interior finish.  All  insulation  of  acoustical  treatments  and
      interior  partitions  shall  be  of  noncombustible  material. Walls and
      ceilings shall have nonporous finishes of class A rating.
        (d) Sprinkler protection.  Automatic  sprinkler  protection  complying
      with the construction provisions of subchapter seventeen of this chapter
      shall be provided, and such protection shall be designed for the type of
      combustible  materials  wherever  such  material  is  used,  and for the
      radioactive material that may be expected to melt, vaporize, or  oxidize
      under  fire  conditions. Laboratory equipment susceptible to damage from
      water or other materials used in the sprinkler system may be shielded by
      hoods except when the equipment provides a source of  combustion.  Where
      sprinkler  protection uses water, or small water-spray installations are
      used to fight small  isolated  fires,  floors  shall  be  provided  with
      drainage  so  that  water  may  be  carried to retention tanks for later
      disposal as required by the New York city health code when contamination
      of the water is to be anticipated.
        (e) Electrical controls. Electrical controls and  equipment  shall  be
      installed  in accordance with the requirements of the electrical code of
      the city of New York.
        (f) Ventilation. Exhaust air from areas in which radioactive materials
      are used or stored shall be exhausted to the outdoors in such manner  as
      not  to  create  a health hazard, and shall not be recirculated to other
      areas of the building.  Air  pressure  in  rooms  in  which  radioactive
      materials  are  used  or  stored  shall  be maintained below the the air
      pressure of adjoining rooms, so that there is  no  flow  of  radioactive
      gases or dusts into adjoining rooms.
        (1)   Ducts  shall  be  of  sheet  steel  of  not  less  than  No.  16
      manufacturers' standard gauge  or  of  other  equivalent  noncombustible
      material   having   a  melting  point  above  eighteen  hundred  degrees
      Fahrenheit. Exhaust ducts within the building, on the discharge side  of
      the fan, shall be welded airtight. Exhaust ducts within the building, on
      the suction side of the fan shall have laps in the direction of air flow
      with  smoke-tight  joints,  and  shall  be  subjected to a smoke test in
      accordance with the requirements for chimneys in subchapter  fifteen  of
      this chapter. Access hatches with tight-closing covers shall be provided
      for cleaning and for fire-fighting in the exhaust system ducts.
        (2)  Fume  hoods shall be exhausted to the outdoors. Controls for hood
      fans shall be interlocked so that contaminated air cannot be drawn  into
      any space from a hood where the exhaust fan is not in operation.
        (3)  Fan  equipment other than the impeller and impeller housing shall
      be located outside the exhaust stream.
        (4) When the degree of contamination of the exhaust stream exceeds the
      concentration limits permitted by the health code, the duct system shall
      be equipped with devices to decontaminate the air to a safe level before
      discharging to the outdoor air.
        (g) Plumbing. Drainage lines from sinks used  for  radioactive  wastes
      shall  be without traps, and shall lead to retention tanks when required
      by the provisions of the New York city health code.
    
    
    
    
    
    
    

Section 27-416
--------------

Section 27-416 ::    
        
     
        §   27-416   Radiation   machines.   Radiation  machines  or  particle
      accelerators, linear accelerators, cyclotrons,  synchrotons,  betatrons,
      or  bevatrons shall be located only in buildings of noncombustible group
      I  construction;  however,  this  requirement   shall   not   apply   to
      conventional  medical, dental, research, or industrial x-ray machines of
      less than one million volt capacity.
    
    
    
    
    
    
    

Section 27-417
--------------

Section 27-417 ::    
        
     
        §  27-417  Storage.  Radioactive  materials  shall be stored in sealed
      containers. When required by the commissioner to avoid too  concentrated
      an  exposure within any one space, radioactive materials shall be stored
      in vaults designed in accordance with the radiation shielding  or  other
      requirements  for  the  materials  to  be stored. When any materials are
      subject to melting, vaporization, or oxidation  under  fire  conditions,
      the   storage   vaults   shall   be   constructed   of  walls  having  a
      fire-resistance rating of at least four hours, and the vaults  shall  be
      equipped  with  automatic  sprinklers  complying  with  the construction
      requirements of subchapter seventeen of this chapter and shall be vented
      through devices to decontaminate the air to a safe level. Doors  opening
      into  storage  vaults  shall  meet  shielding  requirements  and  have a
      fire-protection rating of not less than three hours. All bins, shelving,
      partitions, and pallets in storage vaults  shall  be  of  noncombustible
      materials.  Other  methods of storage permitted by the health department
      or the atomic energy commission, such as storage  under  water,  may  be
      used.
