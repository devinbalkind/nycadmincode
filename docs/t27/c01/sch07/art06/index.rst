Section 27-428 ::    
        
     
        §  27-428  Ventilation.  Mechanical  ventilation  systems  in moderate
      hazard plants shall be adequate to effect ten complete air  changes  per
      hour.    Low  hazard  dry cleaning establishments shall be provided with
      mechanical ventilation adequate to effect four complete air changes  per
      hour.    Ventilating  systems  shall  be  arranged  in such manner as to
      prevent solvent vapors from being admitted to the combustion area of any
      device  requiring  an  open  flame.  Sufficient  make-up  air  shall  be
      introduced  into  all  parts  of  the  establishment  to  equal  the air
      exhausted by the dry cleaning units,  dryers,  and  exhaust  ventilating
      system.  Such  air  shall  not contain any flammable vapors. Openings or
      stacks discharging solvent vapor-air mixtures to the outdoors  shall  be
      located in accordance with the provisions of subchapter thirteen of this
      chapter.
    
    
    
    
    
    
    

Section 27-429

Section 27-429 ::    
        
     
        §  27-429 Coin-operated units. In coin-operated establishments all dry
      cleaning units shall be installed in such a manner that the  working  or
      maintenance  portion  of the equipment shall be separated from the front
      of the units by solid  noncombustible  partitions.  Coin-operated  units
      shall  be located within a diked area, all parts of which are impervious
      to the solvent used in such units. The diked section  shall  be  a  four
      inch  curb  above the floor. Provisions shall be made for the collection
      of solvent spillage into tanks of capacity sufficient to contain all  of
      the  solvent  in  the  dry  cleaning units served, and for return of the
      solvent to the cleaning units through a closed pipe system. Access doors
      to the space in back of the units  shall  be  kept  closed  and  locked.
      Solvent  storage  tanks and other sources of danger shall be so situated
      as to be  inaccessible  to  the  general  public.  In  addition  to  the
      mechanical   ventilation   required   for   low   hazard   dry  cleaning
      establishments, the following mechanical ventilation shall be provided:
        (a) All dry cleaning units shall have facilities that create an inward
      flow of one hundred cubic feet of air per minute into the unit when  the
      loading door is opened.
        (b)  Emergency  ventilation  of  the space in back of the dry cleaning
      units shall be provided so that in emergencies  a  minimum  of  one  air
      change  per  minute  in  the  enclosed space will be provided. Emergency
      ventilation equipment shall be on a circuit that is  separate  from  the
      general lighting and power circuits, and shall be taken off ahead of the
      main  switchboard, or shall be connected to the emergency lighting power
      source when such source is provided.
        (c) A scavenger duct system shall be provided in the space in back  of
      the  units  at  each  unit,  and  shall  be  designed  to  pick up vapor
      surrounding the equipment near the floor and exhaust it at the  rate  of
      one  hundred  cubic  feet  per minute. Scavenger ducts shall not be less
      than five square inches in area.
    
    
    
    
    
    
    

Section 27-430

Section 27-430 ::    
        
     
        § 27-430 Sprinklers. Automatic sprinkler protection complying with the
      construction  provisions  of  subchapter  seventeen  of  this chapter as
      required for occupancy group D-1, shall be provided for moderate  hazard
      dry   cleaning   establishments.   In   addition,   in  moderate  hazard
      establishments each dry cleaning unit shall be provided  with  automatic

      of not less than three-quarters of an inch at a pressure of fifteen psi.
    
    
    
    
    
    
    

Section 27-431
--------------

Section 27-431 ::    
        
     
        §  27-431  Separation  of  direct-fired dryers. In moderate hazard dry
      cleaning establishments, direct-fired dryers shall not be used.  In  low
      hazard  dry  cleaning  establishments  using nonflammable solvents only,
      direct fired dryers may be used, but such dryers shall  not  be  located
      within  twenty-five  feet of a dry cleaning unit unless a noncombustible
      partition (which may be glazed), equipped with  self-closing  doors,  is
      provided  between  the dry cleaning unit and the flame producing device.
      This partition  may  provide  either  complete  or  partial  separation,
      provided  that any partial separation shall be so arranged that the line
      of air travel around the partition from the cleaning units to the  dryer
      is a minimum of twenty-five feet. Where a solid noncombustible partition
      is  constructed  extending  to  the  ceiling  and  all  portions  of the
      enclosure are solid, except for self-closing access doors,  and  outdoor
      air for combustion and drying is supplied, the separation may be reduced
      to fifteen feet.
