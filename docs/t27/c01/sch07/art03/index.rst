Section 27-409 ::    
        
     
        §  27-409  Construction.  (a)  Spray  booths.  Spray  booths  shall be
      substantially  constructed  of  noncombustible  materials.   Panels   of
      polished  wired  glass  at  least  one-quarter inch thick, not exceeding
      seven hundred twenty square inches in area and not more than forty-eight
      inches in any linear dimension, may  be  used  in  the  sides  of  spray
      booths.
        (1)  Spray  booths  shall  be  provided  with a mechanical ventilating
      system meeting the requirements of section 27-410 of this article.
        (2) Each spray booth having a frontal area  larger  than  nine  square
      feet  shall  have  a  noncombustible  deflector  or curtain at least six
      inches deep installed along the upper outer edge of the booth, over  the
      opening,  and shall be protected with an automatic sprinkler system. The
      interior of ducts shall be protected with sprinklers complying with  the
      construction  requirements  of  subchapter  seventeen  of  this chapter,
      installed not more than twelve feet apart in horizontal ducts,  and  the
      sprinklers shall be accessible through duct access doors.
        (b)  Dip  tanks.  Dip  tanks, including their supports and drainboards
      when provided, shall be of an approved type.
    
    
    
    
    
    
    

Section 27-410
--------------

Section 27-410 ::    
        
     
        § 27-410 Ventilation. Spraying or dipping spaces shall be mechanically
      ventilated during spraying or dipping operations so that the velocity of
      air is at least one hundred linear feet per minute in the breathing zone
      of  the operator, conveying air toward the exhaust hood. The ventilating
      system shall be of sufficient capacity to prevent  the  accumulation  of
      mist  or vapors. Air shall be admitted to the spraying or dipping spaces
      in an amount equal to the capacity of the fan or fans and  in  a  manner
      that  prevents  short-circuiting  the path of air in the working zone of
      such spaces. The exhaust fan control shall be interconnected with  spray
      guns  so  that  they  cannot  be operated without the ventilation system
      being in operation. Exhaust fans shall,  in  addition,  be  arranged  to
      operate independently of spray guns. Ventilation equipment shall be kept
      in  operation  for  sufficient  length of time after spraying or dipping
      operations to  exhaust  all  vapors,  fumes,  or  residues  of  spraying
      materials from the spray, space dip space, or drying room.
        (a)  Ventilating  ducts  shall  run  directly  to the outer air and be
      protected with a hood against the weather. Ventilating  ducts  shall  be
      installed  in accordance with the requirements of subchapter thirteen of
      this chapter, but shall not terminate within ten  feet  horizontally  of
      any  chimney outlet, or within twenty feet of any exit or any opening in
      an adjoining wall.
        (b) Make-up air shall be supplied from a point outside the spraying or
      dipping space.
        (c) The exhaust system from any  spraying,  dipping  or  drying  space
      shall  not be connected to any other ventilating system or be discharged
      into a chimney or flue used  for  the  purpose  of  conveying  gases  of
      combustion.
        (d)  Exhaust  fan  blades shall be constructed of nonferrous material.
      Fan blades not coming in direct contact with  spraying  fumes  need  not
      comply with this requirement.
        (e) Adequate access doors or panels, tightly fitted, shall be provided
      to permit inspection and cleaning of ducts.

      accordance with the construction requirements of subchapter seventeen of
      this chapter.
