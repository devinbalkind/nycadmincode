===============================================

Section 27-510
--------------

Section 27-510 ::    
        
     
        § 27-510 Location and height. Tents or air-supported structures may be
      erected  inside  or  outside of the fire districts provided they are not
      more than one story high above the ground, or above a  roof  that  meets
      the requirements of subchapter five of this chapter for fire divisions.
    
    
    
    
    
    
    

Section 27-511
--------------

Section 27-511 ::    
        
     
        §  27-511  Separation.  No  tent  or  air-supported structure shall be
      erected closer than twenty feet to any interior lot line nor closer than
      thirty feet  in  any  direction  to  an  unprotected  opening,  required
      exterior  stairway or corridor, or required exit door, on the same level
      or above the level of the tent or air-supported  structure.  A  tent  or
      air-supported  structure  may  abut  another building on the same lot if
      there are no unprotected openings or exits above or within  thirty  feet
      as above stipulated, if there is no door between them that is a required
      exit, and if the exterior wall separating them meets the requirements of
      subchapter five of this chapter for fire divisions.
        Exceptions.  Requirements  for  separation from other buildings on the
      site shall be waived where a tent or air-supported structure is used for
      on-site  temporary  shelter  for  construction   work,   or   incidental
      fabrication  of  construction  elements  to  be  used  on  the  site  of
      construction.
    
    
    
    
    
    
    

Section 27-512
--------------

Section 27-512 ::    
        
     
        §   27-512   Fire  protection.  The  ground  enclosed  by  a  tent  or
      air-supported structure, and the ground for a distance of at  least  ten
      feet.  outside  of  same,  shall  be cleared and maintained clear of all
      combustible material or vegetation. No open flame of any kind  shall  be
      employed within the structure, or closer than twenty feet to any part of
      the enclosure fabric. Fire extinguishing facilities shall be provided in
      accordance with the requirements of chapter four of this title.
    
    
    
    
    
    
    

Section 27-513
--------------

Section 27-513 ::    
        
     
        §  27-513 Exits. Notwithstanding any other requirements of subchapters
      six and eight of this chapter, travel distance to an exit from any point
      within a tent or air-supported structure shall not  exceed  seventy-five
      feet.  Exit  doors in air-supported structures shall close automatically
      against normal operational pressures. Opening force at the edge of  such
      doors shall not exceed fifteen pounds, with the structure at operational
      pressure. Exit doors shall be located in frames so constructed that they
      will remain operative and support the weight of the structure in a state
      of total collapse.
    
    
    
    
    
    
    

Section 27-514
--------------

Section 27-514 ::    
        
     
        §  27-514  Structural  requirements.  (a) Tents. Tents shall be guyed,
      supported, and braced to withstand a wind pressure  of  ten  pounds  per
      square  foot  of  projected  area  of  the  tent.  The  poles  and their
      supporting guys, stays, stakes, fastenings, etc. shall be of  sufficient
      strength  and  attached  so  as to resist wind pressure of twenty psf of
      projected area of the tent.
        (b) Air-supported structures.
        (1) Air-supported structures  shall  be  anchored  to  the  ground  or
      supporting   structure   by   either   ballast  or  positive  anchorage,
      sufficiently  and  evenly  distributed,  and  adequate  to  resist   the
      inflation  lift  load,  the  aerodynamic lift load, and the drag (shear)
      load due to wind impact. The latter factors shall be  based  on  a  wind
      velocity of at least seventy miles per hour, and an estimated stagnation
      of  not less than 0.5q for structures on grade whose height is equal to,
      or less than, the width of the structure. For greater  heights,  or  for
      elevated structures, increased anchorage shall be provided, justified by
      analytical and/or experimental data.
        (2)  The  skin  of  the  structure  shall be of such strength, and the
      joints so constructed, as to provide a minimum dead load  strip  tensile
      strength  at seventy degrees F of four times the seventy mph design load
      (inflation and aerodynamic loading). The joints  shall  provide  a  dead
      load  strip tensile strength of one hundred sixty degrees F of twice the
      seventy mph design load (i.e., a  factor  of  safety  of  four  and  two
      respectively).  In  addition,  the  material shall provide a trapezoidal
      tear strength of at least fifteen per cent of the maximum design tensile
      load. Material  and  joint  strengths  shall  be  so  certified  by  the
      manufacturer, justified by analytical and/or experimental data.
    
    
    
    
    
    
    

Section 27-515
--------------

Section 27-515 ::    
        
     
        §  27-515  Flame  resistance.  (a) Tents. All materials used for tents
      shall be treated to be flameproofed and  shall  remain  flameproofed  in
      accordance   with   chapter   four  of  this  title.  (b)  Air-supported
      structures. All fabrics that have a base fabric weight of  6.4  oz.  per
      square  yard  or  less  or that are used to enclose spaces classified in
      occupancy group C, E, F, G, H or J shall have an extinction time of  not
      more  than  two seconds when tested under the small scale test method of
      reference standard  RS  7-3.  All  other  fabrics  shall  have  a  flame
      extinction time of not over one minute and/or a flame spread of not over
      one  inch  per  minute  when tested in accordance with the provisions of
      reference standard RS 7-4.
    
    
    
    
    
    
    

Section 27-516
--------------

Section 27-516 ::    
        
     
        §  27-516  Pressurization  system.  Air-supported  structures shall be
      inflated and shall remain inflated during all periods of occupancy to  a
      minimum  differential  pressure  of  0.88 in. and a maximum differential
      pressure of 1.50 in. of water. Ventilation  flow  per  occupant,  either
      through vents or anticipated leakage, shall comply with the requirements
      of subchapter twelve of this chapter.
        Occupied  spaces. Where the net floor area per occupant is one hundred
      fifty square feet or less, the structure shall be provided with at least
      two blowers, each of which shall have adequate capacity to maintain  the
      required  inflation  pressure.  Also,  an auxiliary engine-generator set
      capable of powering one blower, or a supplementary blower powered by  an
      internal  combustion  engine, either of which shall have the capacity to
      run continuously for four hours, shall be located outside the structure,
      shall be weather protected,  and  shall  be  arranged  to  automatically
      operate  the  blower  within  twenty  seconds upon failure of the normal
      source. Heat shall be provided from a source outside  the  structure  so
      arranged  as  to  prevent  the  spread  of  fire  to  the structure. The
      temperature within the air-supported structure shall  be  maintained  at
      the  temperature  required by subchapter twelve of this chapter, but not
      less than fifty degrees Fahrenheit during periods of snowfall.
    
    
    
    
    
    
    

Section 27-517
--------------

Section 27-517 ::    
        
     
        § 27-517 Certificate of occupancy. Certificates of occupancy for tents
      or  air-supported  structures shall be issued for a period not exceeding
      one year, and such certificates may be  renewed  for  one  year  periods
      thereafter  if  the  tent  or  air-supported structure complies with all
      laws, rules and regulations  in  effect  at  the  time  of  request  for
      renewal.
