Section 27-921 ::    
        
     
        ยง 27-921 Testing of plumbing and gas piping systems. (a) New, altered,
      extended,  or repaired systems. Every new plumbing and gas piping system
      and every part of an existing system that has been altered  or  repaired
      except  for  minor  alterations and ordinary repairs, shall be tested as
      hereinafter prescribed to disclose leaks and defects.  However,  testing
      may be waived in the following cases:
        (1)  In  any  case  that  does not involve replacement, alteration, or
      relocation of any water supply, drainage, or vent piping.
        (2) In any case where plumbing equipment may be set up temporarily for
      exhibition purposes.
        (b) Representation at test.
        (1) Tests  required  by  section  27-922  of  this  article  shall  be
      conducted  in the presence of the commissioner or an authorized plumbing
      inspector of the department.
        (2) The commissioner may also authorize such test to be  witnessed  by
      architects,  engineers,  master  plumbers  or representatives of utility
      companies, each of whom must be acceptable to the commissioner.  Persons
      performing  this  function  shall  have  had  at  least  five  (5) years
      experience in inspection and testing of gas piping systems,  or  hold  a
      current master plumbers license. Such tests may be conducted without any
      verifying  inspection  or  tests  by members of the department, provided
      that verified statements and supporting inspectional  and  test  reports
      are filed with the department within one working day of such tests.
        (c)  Exposure  of  work.  If  any  plumbing  system or part thereof is
      enclosed  before  it  has  been  inspected,  tested,  and  accepted   as
      prescribed  in  this  subchapter,  such  system or part thereof shall be
      uncovered upon the direction of the commissioner.
        (d) Retesting. If, upon inspection and tests, any of the work fails to
      meet the test requirements, the  necessary  corrections  shall  be  made
      before any reinspections or retests are conducted.
    
    
    
    
    
    
    

Section 27-922
--------------

Section 27-922 ::    
        
     
        ยง 27-922 Requirements. (a) Drainage and vent systems.
        (1)  ROUGH PLUMBING. Except for outside leaders and perforated or open
      jointed drain tile (subsoil drains), the piping of plumbing drainage and
      venting systems shall be verified as to materials and  shall  be  tested
      upon  completion  of  the  rough  piping  installation  and proven to be
      watertight. The commissioner may require the  removal  of  any  cleanout
      plugs  to ascertain that the prescribed pressure has been reached in all
      parts of the system.
        a. Water test. A water test shall be applied to  the  drainage  system
      either  in  its  entirety  or  in  sections  after rough piping has been
      installed. If applied to the entire system, all openings in the  piping,
      except  the  highest  opening,  shall  be  tightly closed and the system
      filled with water to the point of overflow. If the system is  tested  in
      sections,  each opening, except the highest opening of the section under
      test, shall be tightly plugged and each section filled  with  water.  No
      section  shall  be  tested  with  less than a ten foot head of water. In
      testing successive  sections,  at  least  the  upper  ten  feet  of  the
      following  section  shall  be  tested,  so  that no joint or pipe in the
      building (except the uppermost ten feet of the system) shall  have  been
      submitted  to  a  test  of less than a ten foot head of water. The water
      shall be kept in the system or in the portion under test  for  at  least
      fifteen minutes before inspection starts; the system shall then be tight
      at all points.
        b.  Air  test.  An  air test may be used only when permission for this
      type of test is obtained from the commissioner. The air  test  shall  be
      made  by  attaching  an air compressor testing apparatus to any suitable
      opening and, after closing all other inlets and outlets of  the  system,
      forcing  air  into the system until there is a uniform gauge pressure of
      five psi.  This pressure shall be held, without  introducing  additional
      air, for a period of at least fifteen minutes.
        (2)  FINISHED  PLUMBING. After the plumbing fixtures have been set and
      their traps filled with water,  the  entire  drainage  system  shall  be
      verified  as  to  materials,  and shall be tested and proven gastight by
      either a smoke test or a peppermint test.
        a. Smoke test. The smoke test shall be made by filling all traps  with
      water and then introducing into the entire system a pungent, thick smoke
      produced  by one or more smoke machines. When the smoke appears at stack
      openings on the roof, these openings shall  be  closed  and  a  pressure
      equivalent to a one inch water column shall be maintained for the period
      of the inspection.
        b.  Peppermint  test. The peppermint test shall be made by introducing
      two ounces of oil of peppermint into the roof  vent  terminal  of  every
      line  or  stack to be tested. The oil of peppermint shall be followed at
      once by ten quarts of hot water ( one hundred sixty  degrees  Fahrenheit
      or  higher),  whereupon  all  roof  vent  terminals shall be sealed. The
      detection of the odor of peppermint at any trap or other  point  in  the
      system  shall determine the location of any leaks. Persons who have come
      in contact with the oil of peppermint shall be excluded  from  the  test
      area.
        (b)  Building house sewer. The building house sewer shall be tested by
      inserting a test plug at the point of connection with the  street  sewer
      before  such  connection is made. The building house sewer shall then be
      filled with water under a head of at least ten feet. The water level  at
      the  top  of  the test head of water shall not drop for at least fifteen
      minutes.
        (c) Water systems. Upon completion of a section of a water  system  or
      of  the  entire  water  system, the completed section or system shall be
      verified as to materials, and shall be tested and proven tight  under  a
    
      water  pressure  at  least  twenty-five percent greater than the working
      pressure under which it is to be used. The water used for tests shall be
      obtained from a potable source of supply.
        (d)  Gas  piping  systems.  Upon  completion  of the installation of a
      section of a gas  system  or  of  the  entire  gas  system,  and  before
      appliances  are connected thereto, the completed section or system shall
      be verified as to materials, and tested and proven tight as follows:
        (1) Gas distribution piping:
        a. Distribution pressures up  to  and  including  one-half  psig.  The
      completed  piping is to be tested with a non-mercury gauge at a pressure
      of three pounds per square inch gauge (psig) for  a  minimum  of  thirty
      minutes.
        b.  Distribution  pressures over one-half psig through three psig. The
      completed piping is to be tested at fifty psig for a minimum  of  thirty
      minutes.
        c.  Distribution  pressures  over three psig through fifteen psig. The
      completed piping is to be tested at one hundred psig for  a  minimum  of
      one hour.
        d.  Distribution pressures above fifteen psig. The completed piping is
      to be tested to twice the maximum allowable operating pressure, but  not
      less than one hundred psig, for a minimum of one hour.
        (2)  Meter  piping  shall  be  pressure  tested in accordance with the
      requirements of the serving utility. These requirements shall be  either
      the  same  as  those for testing distribution piping in paragraph one of
      this subdivision, or if different, the piping shall be certified by  the
      local utility as being tested in compliance with their requirements.
        (3)  Notwithstanding  the  above,  all  coded or wrapped pipe shall be
      pressure tested at a minimum of ninety psig.
        For testing, the piping shall be filled with air or an inert gas,  and
      the  source  of  pressure shall be isolated before the pressure readings
      are made. All test duration  time  periods  are  to  be  measured  after
      stabilization  of  testing  medium.  Fresh water may be used as the test
      medium only where the required test pressure exceeds one hundred psig.
        (4) The commissioner  shall  publish  a  list  of  non-mercury  gauges
      certified  by  a  nationally  recognized testing lab or promulgate rules
      with standards for non-mercury gauges within one hundred and twenty days
      of the effective date of this paragraph.
        (e) Other piping systems. All other piping systems shall be tested  in
      accordance with the requirements prescribed in reference standard RS-16.
