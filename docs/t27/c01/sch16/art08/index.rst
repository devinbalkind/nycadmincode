      this  article  for  the  alteration  of  existing  buildings;  provided,
      however,  that  such waiver is based upon a specific finding that strict
      compliance with these requirements:

        (3) would be physically or legally impossible; or
        (4) would be unnecessary in light of  alternatives  which  insure  the
      achievement  of  the  intended  objective  or which achieve the intended
      objective more efficiently, effectively or economically; or
        (5) would entail a  change  so  slight  as  to  produce  a  negligible
      additional benefit consonant with the purposes of this article.
        b.  Each  application for a waiver under subdivision a of this section
      shall be made  to  the  commissioner  in  writing,  setting  forth  each
      requirement  sought  to  be  waived  and  the specific reason or reasons
      therefor.  The  commissioner  shall  determine,   under   all   of   the
      circumstances  presented by such application, which of such requirements
      may  appropriately  be  waived.  The  commissioner  shall  render   such
      determination  in  a  writing  which  shall  set  forth  in  detail  the
      commissioner's findings and conclusions with respect to each requirement
      sought to be waived. A copy  of  such  written  determination  shall  be
      forwarded  to  the  applicant. Such written determination shall be filed
