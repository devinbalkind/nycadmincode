Section 27-740 ::    
        
     
        §  27-740  Heating  requirements. All habitable or occupiable rooms or
      spaces, and all other rooms or spaces listed in  table  12-1,  shall  be
      provided  with  means  of heating in accordance with the requirements of
      this subchapter and reference standard RS 12-1. Heating systems shall be
      capable of producing the required temperatures listed in table 12-1 when
      the outdoor temperature is five degrees Fahrenheit and the wind velocity
      is fifteen mph. In highly exposed locations, provision shall be made for
      higher wind velocities. Heating equipment shall  not  be  required  when
      either of the following conditions exist:
        (a)  Where  the  occupancy is seasonal and the rooms or buildings will
      not be occupied between November first and May first  of  the  following
      year.
        (b)  Where  the  processes or activities normally conducted within the
      space will generate sufficient heat to  produce  the  prescribed  indoor
      temperature during the time of occupancy.

        {a} Where  the listed temperatures differ from those that are required
      to be maintained under the provisions of section 131.03 of the New  York
      city health code, the higher temperature shall apply.
    
    
    
    
    
    
    

Section 27-741
--------------

Section 27-741 ::    
        
     
        §  27-741  Minimum  temperature requirements. Heating systems shall be
      capable of producing the required  minimum  space  temperatures  as  set
      forth  in  table  12-1.  Where the occupancy of a space does not conform
      exactly with  any  of  the  spaces  listed,  the  temperature  shall  be
      determined  by  the  requirements  of  the listed space to which it most
      nearly conforms.
    
    
    
    
    
    
    

Section 27-742
--------------

Section 27-742 ::    
        
     
        §  27-742  Devices  producing  incidental  heat. Where a room or space
      contains equipment that  produces  heat,  such  as  motors,  generators,
      resistors,  lights,  compressors,  steam heated vessels, etc., and where
      such equipment is in constant use during the period  of  occupancy,  the
      equipment  may  be  considered  as  a  supplementary heating device. Its
      heating capacity may be deducted  from  the  required  capacity  of  the
      heating devices in the room.
    
    
    
    
    
    
    

Section 27-743
--------------

Section 27-743 ::    
        
     
        §  27-743 Capacity of central heat sources. Where central heat sources
      are used, they shall have a gross output capacity sufficient to  provide
      for  the  required  heating  load,  including  appropriate allowance for
      distribution losses, pick-up, and the heating of domestic hot  water  if
      the central heat source is used for that purpose.
    
    
    
    
    
    
    

Section 27-744
--------------

Section 27-744 ::    
        
     
        §  27-744  System  design.  Where  central  heat sources are used, the
      heating system including all wiring, piping and/or  ductwork,  the  heat
      sources  and  the  various  space  heating devices shall be designed and
      installed so as to be capable of producing the minimum temperatures  set
      forth  in  table 12-1. Also, the installation of the entire system shall
      be in accordance with applicable requirements  of  this  subchapter  and
      subchapters thirteen through sixteen of this chapter, and the electrical
      code of the city of New York.
