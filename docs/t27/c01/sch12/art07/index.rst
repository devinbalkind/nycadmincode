        (a) Window requirements. To be credited as ventilating openings  under
      the  provisions of this subchapter, windows or other openings shall meet
      the requirements of section 27-749 of article six  of  this  subchapter,
      and  where  mechanical  supply ventilation is not provided, shall have a
      free openable area of at least one square foot per  one  hundred  square
      feet of floor area.
        (b) Air conditioning.
        (1) In air conditioned rooms, the windows and other openings shall not
      be  credited  as  such  in  computing  the  index  for  ventilation. Air
      conditioned rooms shall be considered as interior rooms.
        (2) Air that has been exhausted from an air conditioned space  may  be
      reconditioned   by   air  conditioning  apparatus  and  recirculated  as
      equivalent outdoor air, provided that the total of  supply  air  is  not
      less  than required for air conditioned rooms by table 12-2 and that the
      amount of actual outdoor air is at least thirty-three and one-third  per
      cent  of  the  required  total. The actual outdoor air supply shall not,
      under any circumstances, be reduced to less than five cfm per  occupant,
      except  that these minimum requirements may be reduced by fifty per cent
      as provided in section 27-755 of this article.
        (c) Required exhaust. Required exhaust may be accomplished by  raising
      the  pressure within the space with consequent leakage through doors and
      windows, or by drawing the vitiated air from air conditioned spaces into
      the return air duct of air conditioning apparatus  or  into  an  exhaust
      duct discharging directly to the outdoor air.
        (d)  Make-up  air.  A  sufficient  quantity of air to make the exhaust
      system effective shall be provided to the space being exhausted  by  one
      or by any combination of the following methods:
        (1) By supplying air to the space by means of a blower system.
        (2)  By  infiltration  through  louvres, registers, or other permanent
      openings in walls, doors, or partitions, adjoining spaces where  air  is
      supplied by one of these methods.
        (3) By infiltration through cracks around window sash and doors.
        (4) By other methods acceptable to the commissioner.
        (e)  Prohibited  use  of  recirculated  air. Air drawn from any of the
      following spaces may not be recirculated; mortuary rooms;  bathrooms  or
    
      toilet  rooms; or any space where an objectionable quantity of flammable
      vapors, dust, odors, or noxious gases is present. Air drawn  from  rooms
      that  must  be  isolated to prevent the spread of infection shall not be
      recirculated, except that air drawn from hospital operating rooms may be
      recirculated, if in compliance with the following requirements:
        (1)  There  shall  be  a  minimum of twenty-five total air changes per
      hour, of which five air changes per hour shall be outdoor air.
        (2) All fans serving exhaust systems shall be located at the discharge
      end of the system.
        (3) Outdoor air intakes shall be located  at  least  twenty-five  feet
      from   exhaust   outlets   of  ventilation  systems  and  other  exhaust
      discharges,  combustion  equipment  stacks,  medical   surgical   vacuum
      systems,  and  plumbing  vent  stacks,  from  areas  which  may  collect
      vehicular exhaust such as off-street loading bays, and from areas  which
      may  collect  other  noxious  fumes.  The  bottom of outdoor air intakes
      serving central systems if installed above a roof, shall be  located  at
      least three feet above roof level.
        (4) Positive air pressure shall be maintained at all times in relation
      to adjacent areas.
        (5)  All  ventilation  or  air conditioning systems serving such rooms
      shall be equipped with a filter bed of twenty-five per  cent  efficiency
      upstream  of  the  air conditioning equipment and a filter bed of ninety
      per cent efficiency downstream of  the  supply  fan,  any  recirculating
      spray  water  systems  and  water reservoir type humidifiers. All filter
      efficiencies shall be average atmospheric dust spot efficiencies  tested
      in accordance with ASHRAE standard 52-68.
        (6) A manometer shall be installed across each filter bed.
        (7) Duct linings shall not be used in ventilation and air conditioning
      systems  serving  such  rooms unless terminal filters of at least ninety
      per cent efficiency are installed downstream of linings.
        (8) Air supplied shall be delivered at or near the  ceilings  and  all
      exhaust air shall be removed near floor level, with at least two exhaust
      outlets not less than three inches above the floor.
        (f)  Outdoor  air  intakes.  For  high-rise  office  buildings erected
      pursuant to new building applications filed on or  after  the  effective
      date  of  this  section,  outdoor  air  intakes serving spaces above the
      second story and serving spaces greater than ten thousand square feet of
      floor area shall be located at least twenty feet above ground level,  at
      least  twenty feet from exhaust outlets of ventilation systems and other
      exhaust discharges, and at least twenty feet from areas that may collect
      vehicular exhaust such as off-street loading bays.

Section 27-755 ::    
        
     
        ยง  27-755  Use  of  adsorption  devices. In all cases where the use of
      recirculated air is permitted, the required outdoor air  supply  may  be
      reduced  up  to  fifty  per  cent, provided that the recirculated air is
      passed through adsorption  devices.  The  adsorption  devices  shall  be
      approved  and  rated.  Means  shall  be  provided  for  maintaining  the
      effectiveness of the adsorption devices.
        (a) Improper maintenance. Should the adsorption devices be  improperly
      maintained so that their effectiveness is impaired, the commissioner may
      order  their  removal.  If  the  adsorption devices are removed, the air
      conditioning  or  ventilating  system  shall  not  be  operated  without
      supplying  one  hundred  per  cent  of  the outdoor air required by this
      article or article eight of this subchapter.
        (b) Test records. The building owner shall, at all times,  maintain  a
      maintenance  record  showing  the  manufacturer's  recommendation of the
      frequency of tests, the method of making tests, and the results  of  all
      tests  of the adsorption devices. Such tests shall be made and certified
      by the manufacturer or by a laboratory acceptable to the commissioner at
      least twice every six  months.  The  records  of  such  tests  shall  be
      maintained  for  a  period of at least two years, and shall be available
      for inspection by the commissioner.
        (c) Ventilation of water closet compartments. The use  of  any  device
      that  returns  exhaust air from water closet compartments or from toilet
      rooms after passing through adsorption devices is  not  permitted  as  a
      means  of providing ventilation for a water closet compartment for which
      a mechanical system of ventilation is required.
