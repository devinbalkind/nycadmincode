        §  27-750  Area  of  ventilating openings. Ventilating openings in all
      habitable rooms or spaces shall have a free openable area  of  at  least
      five percent of the floor area of the room or space ventilated and where

      above requirements but not less than five and one-half  square  feet  in
      aggregate.  In  all  occupiable  rooms or spaces, the free openable area
      shall be used to calculate the index for ventilation (section 27-753  of
      article  seven  of  this  subchapter), which shall determine the minimum
