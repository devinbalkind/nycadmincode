Section 16-201
--------------

Section 16-201 ::    
        
     
        §  16-201  Facility  assignment. a. The commissioner is authorized and
      empowered to promulgate regulations and procedures for the management on
      a city-wide basis of all solid waste generated or disposed of within the
      city and to supervise and regulate the transportation and disposition of
      all solid waste generated or disposed of within the city pursuant to the
      standards established herein, provided that no regulation shall abridge,
      impair or restrict any bona fide firm  contracts  for  the  purchase  or
      delivery  of  solid  waste  for  resource  recovery entered into between
      private parties prior to the date at which final notice  of  regulations
      is  filed  with  th  city  clerk,  and  that  any  such  regulations are
      accompanied by a justification of  such  regulations  that  demonstrates
      either:
        (1)  That  regulating  privately collected solid waste or a portion of
      such waste, whether by waste origin, destination, type or by  any  other
      reasonable  basis  will,  in  the  opinion  of  the  commissioner,  help
      facilitate the construction, expansion, rehabilitation or operation,  by
      or  for  the city, of a solid waste recovery and management facility, or
      will help the city discharge its responsibilites  with  respect  to  the
      management,  including  trasportation  and  disposition,  on a city-wide
      basis, of all solid waste generated or disposed of within the city, or
        (2) That a declaration of imminent peril to the public health has been
      authorized by the board of health and such situation can be addressed or
      prevented by regulating the disposal of privately collected waste.
        b. The commissioner may assign to persons who collect  or  dispose  of
      solid waste a solid waste recovery and management facility or facilities
      at  which  such  persons  shall deliver such waste. The commissioner may
      assign days and hours when such persons shall use such  facilities,  and
      may  limit or prohibit collection truck traffic on particular streets or
      limit such traffic to certain hours of the day.
        c. The commissioner shall weigh as one critical consideration  in  his
      ultimate  determination  of  specific site assignments for disposal, the
      minimization of solid waste disposal vehicle traffic and  transportation
      cost on city streets and roadways.
        d. The commissioner shall further consider the following objectives in
      determining facility assignments:
        (1) meeting the daily operating capacity requirements of each resource
      recovery facility and minimizing overloading of facilities:
        (2) extending the useful life of existing municipal landfills;
        (3)  ensuring  the  economic viability of resource recovery facilities
      processing waste generated within the city;
        (4) ensuring that unacceptable wastes do not enter facilities;
        (5) meeting any contractual obligations required under any  resolution
      or  resolutions  authorizing  the  issuance  of  bonds  for  solid waste
      recovery and management facilities, or entered into pursuant to  chapter
      five hundred sixty of the laws of nineteen hundred eighty;
        (6) achieving uniform deliveries and minimizing congestion and dumping
      delays at facilities.
        e.  The  commissioner  shall  exercise due diligence in notifying each
      person assigned to a facility of a scheduled closing of such facility by
      certified mail at least seventy-two hours prior to  such  closing.  Such
      notification  shall  include  the  expected  duration of the closing and
      assignments to  alternative  facilities  and  days  and  times  of  such
      assignments.
        f.  The commissioner shall exercise due diligence in notifying persons
      assigned to a facility of an emergency closing  of  a  facility  or  any
      emergency   during  which  facilities  are  not  available.  Unless  the
      commissioner provides  alternative  facilities  persons  assigned  to  a
    
      closed or unavialable facility may arrange alternative means of disposal
      during the closing or unavailability of such facilities.

Section 16-202 ::    
        
     
        §  16-202  Waste acceptability. a. The commissioner shall promulgate a
      list of facilities and solid wastes accepted and not  accepted  at  each
      such facility.
        b.  Solid  wastes  not  acceptable  at  certain  or all facilities may
      include, but need not be limited to, the following:
        (1) solid wastes that may adversely affect the  health  or  safety  of
      facility employees or damage facility equipment:
        (2)  wastes  designated  as  hazardous  wastes pursuant to the federal
      resource  conservation  and  recovery  act  of  1976,  as  amended,  and
      regulations  promulgated  pursuant  thereto and titles seven and nine of
      article twenty-seven of the New York environmental conservation law  and
      regulations promulgated pursuant thereto;
        (3)  wastes designated as hazardous air pollutants pursuant to section
      one hundred twelve of  the  federal  clean  air  act,  as  amended,  and
      regulations promulgated pursuant to such act;
        (4) sewage sludge or containerized or free liquids;
        (5)  bulk  wastes  of  a  size  or  dimension  too  cumbersome for the
      efficient burning at incinerators or resource recovery facilities;
        (6) any or all classes of regulated medical  waste  or  other  medical
      waste  as  defined  in  section  16-120.1  provided  that  such  list be
      consistent with such section.
    
    
    
    
    
    
    

Section 16-203
--------------

Section 16-203 ::    
        
     
        §  16-203  Charges.  a. The rates for use of facilities provided by or
      for the department shall be fixed by the  board  of  estimate  upon  the
      recommendation  of  the commissioner, who shall require persons assigned
      to such facilities to pay such rates.
        b. The rates shall be sufficient, when added to other  waste  disposal
      and resource recovery revenues and to the value to the department of its
      proportionate   use   of  all  facilities  comprising  the  solid  waste
      management system of the city, as determined  by  the  commissioner,  to
      provide   for   all   expenses   of  transportation,  land  acquisition,
      construction,    equipment,    operations     including     enforcement,
      administrative and insurance costs, maintenance, expansion, replacement,
      financing and reasonable reserves therefore and any other costs that may
      be  required for the financing or completion of facilities, equipment or
      land to be used for furnishing  solid  waste  management  services.  The
      commissioner  may  from time to time recommend and the board of estimate
      may prescribe changes in rates, provided  that  such  changes  shall  be
      based  on  changes  in  the  cost  of  furnishing solid waste management
      services.
        c. The rate for each facility may be fixed so as to vary according  to
      volume,  location  of facility assignment, or weight, type, character or
      difficulty of storing, processing or disposing of the  solid  waste,  or
      other factors relating to economic efficiency or allocation of resources
      and  may  not  discriminate  between  classes of users. The commissioner
      shall state the  basis  for  establishing  such  varying  rates  in  the
      commissioner's recommendations to the board of estimate.
        d.  The  commissioner shall notify by mail all persons assigned to use
      facilities of the first meeting of the board of estimate  at  which  any
      resolution  fixing or changing such rates is scheduled to be considered.
      Such notice shall be mailed at least thirty days prior to such board  of
      estimate  meeting  and shall include the proposed rates or rate changes.
      Failure to provide such notice shall not affect  the  validity  of  such
      rates.
        e.  The  commissioner  may  collect  charges  in  such  manner  as  he
      determines shall minimize burdens and costs of the department,  provided
      that  the  commissioner shall also consider burdens and costs of persons
      assigned to facilities.

        §  16-204  Recordkeeping and filing requirements. Each person assigned
      to a facility or facilities shall submit to the commissioner  an  annual
      report  on  such  date  as  the  commissioner shall determine, in a form
      established by the commissioner, which provides information required  by
      the  commissioner  to plan, develop, maintain and operate facilities and
      provide waste management services. Such information  shall  include  but
      not  be  limited to daily solid waste volumes and general composition or
      character of wastes by each vehicle route to and from facilities.
    
    
    
    
    
    
    

Section 16-205
--------------

Section 16-205 ::    
        
     
        §  16-205 Variances. a. There shall be in the department a solid waste
      management board consisting of the  commissioner,  the  commissioner  of
      consumer  affairs  and the executive director of the office for economic
      development, all of whom shall serve on the board  without  compensation
      and  all  of  whom  shall  have the power to exercise or delegate any of
      their functions, powers and duties as members of the board.  Such  board
      may  grant variances from a regulation or modify assignments or rates of
      the commissioner involving the transportation,  storage,  processing  or
      disposal  of  solid  waste when such board finds that such regulation or
      order would impose unreasonable economic hardship. The specific terms of
      any variance granted shall be determined by such board on a case by case
      basis. Any person seeking a variance shall do so  by  filing  with  such
      board  a  petition for variance in a form prescribed by such board. Such
      forms shall document the need for a variance.
        b. Exemptions from formal variance request procedures may be made  for
      day-to-day   operational   hardships  such  as  equipment  failure.  The
      commissioner may grant temporary facility and time assignment  variances
      to  persons  who  report  such  hardships  to the commissioner. Proof of
      hardship must be submitted to the commissioner within the time frame set
      by the commissioner. Subsequent exemptions may be withheld  for  failing
      to submit proof of hardship for any prior request.

Section 16-207
--------------

Section 16-207 ::    
        
     
        §  16-207 Regulations. a. The commissioner, upon the recommendation of
      the solid waste management board and upon the approval of the  board  of
      estimate,  may  exempt  that  portion of privately collected solid waste
      from all or some provisions of any regulations for such period  of  time
      as  is necessary and appropriate up to forty years, if the regulation of
      that solid waste  will  materially  and  adversely  interfere  with  the
      development,  financing  or  operation of any resource recovery facility
      owned or operated or being developed privately. Any  person  seeking  an
      exemption  shall do so by filing with the solid waste management board a
      petition for exemption in a form prescribed by  such  board.  Such  form
      shall  document  the  need  for  an exemption. The effective date of any
      exemptions granted may be withheld until a bona  fide,  firm,  long-term
      contract  has  been  executed for delivery of such solid waste to a safe
      and reliable facility and copy of such contract has been received by the
      solid waste management board.
        b. In the event that any resource recovery facility owned or  operated
      privately fails to adequately process or dispose of solid waste and such
      facility does not provide for alternate storage, processing or disposal,
      the  privately  collected  solid  waste exempted from regulation and not
      disposed by the facility may be made suject to any regulation for  which
      it had been exempted.
        c.  (1) Nothing herein shall be construed to prohibit or limit private
      collectors from extracting from the waste they  collect  materials  that
      have  value  to  such collectors for the purposes of recycling, reuse or
      resale.
        (2) Any regulations promulgated shall not limit the amount or type  of
      solid  waste  utilized  by  any  person  for the purposes of composting,
      materials recovery from solid waste, or operation of a recycling center.
        d. Such regulations shall  make  reasonable  accommodation  to  permit
      persons  to  deliver  solid  waste  to recycling facilities or permitted
      transfer facilities for the sole purpose  of  materials  reclamation  or
      volume reduction, provided, however, that nothing contained herein shall
      materially  impair  the  authority  of  the  commissioner to enforce the
      regulation of the residual solid waste resulting from  such  reclamation
      or volume reduction activities in accordance with this chapter.
