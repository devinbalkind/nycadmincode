Section 16-450 ::    
        
     
        § 16-450 Title. This chapter shall be known as and may be cited as the
      "New York City Plastic Carryout Bag and Film Plastic Recycling Law".

Section 16-451 ::    
        
     
        § 16-451 Declaration of policy. It is hereby declared to be the public
      policy  of  the  city  of New York to reduce environmental pollution, to
      reduce the toxicity  of  waste  materials  in  the  solid  waste  stream
      directed  to  resource recovery and sanitary landfill facilities, and to
      maximize the removal of plastic carryout bags and film plastic from  the
      waste  stream  in  order to recycle them. Plastic carryout bags and film
      plastic do not biodegrade, which means that such bags and  film  plastic
      ultimately  break  down  into  smaller  pieces that enter the ecosystem.
      These pieces of plastic cause illness, injury and death  to  animal  and
      marine life by entangling them or contaminating their food supplies. The
      production  of  plastic  bags  and  film  plastic worldwide uses over 12
      million barrels of oil per year, which causes significant  environmental
      impacts.
