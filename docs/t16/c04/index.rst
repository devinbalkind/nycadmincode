      a location  within  the  retail  establishment  convenient  for  use  by

      the manufacturer, into which consumers  may  deposit  used  rechargeable
      batteries.

      manufacturers  working  together, shall submit annual reports concerning
      the amount of rechargeable batteries received and  recycled  within  the
      city  of  New  York,  either  by  number or by weight; the costs of such
      efforts; and any other relevant information to the commissioner  or  any
      other person responsible for the city of New York's recycling programs.
        3.   Every   battery  manufacturer,  or  any  combination  of  battery
      manufacturers working together, shall undertake efforts to  educate  the
      citizens  of  the  city  of  New  York regarding the appropriate ways to
      recycle rechargeable batteries.
        c. The commissioner, or any other person responsible for the  city  of

      manufacturer's collection, transportation, and recycling plans described
