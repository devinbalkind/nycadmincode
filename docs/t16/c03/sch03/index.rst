Section 16-316 ::    
        
     
        ยง  16-316  Recycling and composting economic development study. Within
      two years of the effective date of  this  section,  the  department,  in
      conjunction   with   the   mayor's  office  of  long-term  planning  and
      sustainability and the New York city economic  development  corporation,
      shall  perform  a study on the economics of recycling and composting and
      the development of recycling and composting-related  industries  in  the
      city  of  New  York.  Such  study  shall:  (i)  assess the New York city
      recycling market including but not limited  to  a  growth  forecast  for
      recycling  markets  and related industries for the next five years; (ii)
      describe those industries or businesses that would address  shortcomings
      in  the  city's  recycling and composting infrastructure and areas where
      opportunities for recycling and composting-related  job  growth  in  the
      city  appear  practical, describing barriers to recycling and composting
      businesses, and outlining financial and other incentives that  might  be
      successful in attracting new recycling and composting-related businesses
      or    encouraging    the    expansion    of   existing   recycling   and
      composting-related  businesses;  (iii)  examine  existing  markets   for
      processing  and  purchasing  recyclable  materials and the potential and
      steps necessary to expand these markets; and (iv)  look  at  the  city's
      taxation and finance authority to stimulate recycling and the demand for
      recycled materials. Sections of such study may be shared with or derived
      from the composting report required pursuant to section 16-316.2 of this
      subchapter.

        ยง  16-316.1  Waste  characterization  study. a. The commissioner shall
      complete follow-up studies to the studies performed in two thousand five
      regarding  the   characteristics   of   the   city's   residential   and
      institutional  waste  streams  for  department-managed solid waste on or
      before January thirty-first, two  thousand  twelve,  and  on  or  before

        b. On or before January thirty-first, two  thousand  twenty-four,  the
      commissioner   shall   complete   a   detailed,  comprehensive  citywide
      multi-season study of the city's  residential  and  institutional  waste
      streams  for  the  purpose  of  determining the composition of the waste
      stream characterized by type of material. The results of such study  and
      an  analysis  of those results shall be submitted to the council and the
      mayor within sixty days of its completion.

Section 16-316.2. ::    
        
     
        ยง   16-316.2.   Food   waste  composting  study.  The  department,  in
      conjunction  with  the  mayor's  office  of   long-term   planning   and
      sustainability,  shall issue a report by July first, two thousand twelve
      recommending methods to expand the diversion of compostable  waste  from
      the city's waste stream. In preparing such report, the department or the
      office  of  long-term  planning  and  sustainability shall (1) study the
      viability  of  a  curbside  collection   program   for   household   and
      institutional  compostable  waste  including,  but  not limited to, cost
      considerations and any concerns regarding siting  composting  facilities
      to  conduct  such  a  curbside collection program; (2) identify existing
      private and public facilities within three hundred  miles  of  the  city
      that accept compostable waste for composting and determine the available
      capacity at and cost to deliver compostable waste to such facilities and
      any   siting  considerations  concerning  such  facilities;  (3)  review
      capacity at putrescible solid waste transfer stations permitted  by  the
      city,  and  putrescible solid waste transfer stations within sixty miles
      of the city, and  determine  whether  any  such  transfer  stations  are
      capable    of   accepting   source-separated   compostable   waste   for
      consolidation and transportation, the cost to  deliver  source-separated
      compostable  waste  to  such  facilities  and  any siting considerations
      concerning such facilities; (4)  explore  opportunities  to  expand  the
      currently  available  capacity  to compost compostable waste at existing
      sites within the city or, in conjunction  with  the  study  required  by
      section  16-316 of this chapter, explore opportunities to develop one or
      more new facilities within the city or within sixty miles  of  the  city
      for  the composting of compostable waste, including, but not limited to,
      opportunities to  work  with  one  or  more  entities  to  develop  such
      facilities and any siting considerations concerning such a facility; (5)
      compile a comprehensive list of sites around the city including, but not
      limited  to,  city  botanical  gardens  and  greenmarkets,  that  accept
      household and institutional compostable waste on a voluntary basis,  and
      recommend   methods  to  encourage  and  expand  options  for  voluntary
      composting; and (6) provide a plan to study the viability of instituting
      a food waste composting program for the residential or commercial  waste
      stream, to be completed within two years of the issuance of such report.
