        ยง  16-305  Recycling  of  department-managed  solid  waste.  a. 1. The
      following recycling percentage goals are established for  the  recycling
      of department-managed solid waste:
        i.   by   July   first,   two  thousand  eleven,  sixteen  percent  of
      department-managed solid waste;
        ii.  by  July  first,  two  thousand  thirteen,  nineteen  percent  of
      department-managed solid waste;
        iii.  by  July  first,  two  thousand  fourteen, twenty-one percent of

        i. By July first, two thousand eleven, sixteen percent of curbside and
      containerized waste collected by the department;
        ii. By July first, two thousand thirteen, eighteen percent of curbside
      and containerized waste collected by the department;
        iii.  By  July  first,  two  thousand  fourteen,  nineteen  percent of
      curbside and containerized waste collected by the department;
        iv. By  July  first,  two  thousand  sixteen,  twenty-one  percent  of

        vi. By July first,  two  thousand  nineteen,  twenty-four  percent  of
      curbside and containerized waste collected by the department; and
        vii.  by  July  first,  two  thousand  twenty,  twenty-five percent of
      curbside and containerized waste collected by the department.
        b. The commissioner shall adopt and  implement  rules  designating  at
      least  six  recyclable  materials,  including  plastics  to  the  extent
      required in subdivision c of this section and yard waste to  the  extent
      required   in   section   16-308   of   this   chapter,   contained   in
      department-managed  solid  waste  and  requiring  households  to  source
      separate such designated materials.
        c.  1.  Prior  to commencing delivery of department-managed recyclable
      materials to the designated recycling processing facility at  the  South
      Brooklyn Marine Terminal, the commissioner shall designate as recyclable
      materials,   and   require  the  source  separation  of,  rigid  plastic
      containers.
        2. If the commissioner, in his or her discretion, determines that  the
      cost  to  the  city of recycling rigid plastic containers required to be
      designated as recyclable materials pursuant to  paragraph  one  of  this
      subdivision  is  not reasonable in comparison with the cost of recycling
      only metal, glass and plastic and have  been  designated  as  recyclable
      materials  as  of  the  effective  date of the local law that added this
      subdivision, the commissioner shall within ten business days notify  and
      provide  documentation to the council of the factors relied upon to make
      such determination and shall not be required to designate any such rigid
      plastic containers as recyclable materials.
        3. If the commissioner  determines  that  the  cost  to  the  city  of
      recycling  rigid plastic containers is not reasonable in comparison with
      the cost of recycling only metal,  glass  and  plastic  that  have  been
      designated as recyclable materials as of the effective date of the local
    
      law  that  added  this  subdivision,  the  commissioner  shall  annually
      reevaluate the cost to  the  city  of  designating  such  rigid  plastic
      containers  as  recyclable  materials,  and  shall  annually  make a new
      determination  as  to whether the cost of designating such containers as
      recyclable materials is  reasonable  in  comparison  with  the  cost  of
      recycling  only  metal,  glass  and plastic that have been designated as
      recyclable materials as of the effective date  of  the  local  law  that
      added  this subdivision and shall report such evaluations to the council
      as part of the department's annual recycling report required pursuant to
      subdivision k of section 16-305 of this chapter.  The  department  shall
      not  promulgate rules designating rigid plastic containers as recyclable
      materials, and need not conduct outreach or education  relating  thereto
      if,  pursuant  to  paragraph  two  of this subdivision, the commissioner
      determines that  the  cost  of  the  city  of  recycling  rigid  plastic
      containers  is  not  reasonable in comparison with the cost of recycling
      only metal, glass and plastic that have been  designated  as  recyclable
      materials  as  of  the  effective  date of the local law that added this
      subdivision.
        4. Immediately following the promulgation of rules  designating  rigid
      plastic   containers  as  recyclable  materials,  the  department  shall
      undertake outreach and education, in cooperation with any  other  agency
      or  entity  designated  for  that purpose by the commissioner, to inform
      residents  of  such  new  designation  and  to  provide  instruction  on
      compliance  with  the  requirements  of  this  subdivision and the rules
      promulgated pursuant thereto.
        d. The commissioner  shall  adopt  and  implement  rules  establishing
      procedures  requiring  the  placement of the designated materials at the
      curbside,  in  specialized  containers,  or  in  any  other  manner  the
      commissioner  determines, to facilitate the collection of such materials
      in a manner that enables them to  be  recycled.  Under  such  rules,  no
      person  shall  be  liable for incorrectly placing a non-designated rigid
      plastic container in the recycling stream.
        e. Where the department provides solid waste collection services to  a
      building containing at least four and no more than eight dwelling units,
      the  commissioner  shall  adopt and implement rules requiring the owner,
      net lessee or person in charge of such building to:
        1. provide for the residents, where  practicable,  a  designated  area
      and,  where  appropriate,  containers  in  which  to  store  the  source
      separated or other designated recyclable materials to  be  collected  by
      the department; and
        2.  inform  all  residents of the requirements of this chapter and the
      rules  promulgated  pursuant  thereto  by,   at   a   minimum,   posting
      instructions  on  source  separation in or near the designated recycling
      area and making available to each resident at the inception of a  lease,
      where applicable, a department-issued guide to recycling, which shall be
      made  available  to  the  owner,  net lessee or person in charge of such
      building by the department pursuant to section 16-315 of this chapter in
      print form or on the department's website, or in  an  alternative  guide
      containing  similar  information to the guide required by section 16-315
      of this chapter.
        If reasonably accessible space for the storage of source separated  or
      other designated recyclable materials is not available in such building,
      and  such  space  is available behind the building's property line, such
      space behind the property line may be designated as  the  area  for  the
      storage of source separated or other designated recyclable materials. If
      no such space is available, the owner, net lessee or person in charge of
      such building shall post instructions on recycling and source separation
    
      in  or  near  a  designated area that is visible to all residents in the
      building.
        With  respect  to solid waste generated by households in the aforesaid
      buildings, the obligations of an owner, net lessee or person  in  charge
      of  such building under this chapter shall be limited to those set forth
      in this subdivision and subdivisions d and g of this  section  or  rules
      promulgated pursuant to such subdivisions.
        f.  Where the department provides solid waste collection services to a
      building containing nine or more dwelling units, the commissioner  shall
      adopt  and  implement rules requiring the owner, net lessee or person in
      charge of such building to:
        1. provide for the residents a designated area and, where appropriate,
      containers in which to store the source separated  or  other  designated
      recyclable materials to be collected by the department;
        2.  inform  all  residents of the requirements of this chapter and the
      rules  promulgated  pursuant  thereto  by,   at   a   minimum,   posting
      instructions  on  source  separation in or near the designated recycling
      area, and making available to each resident at the inception of a lease,
      a department-issued guide to recycling, which shall be made available to
      the owner, net lessee or person  in  charge  of  such  building  by  the
      department  pursuant  to section 16-315 of this chapter in print form or
      on the department's website,  or  in  an  alternative  guide  containing
      similar  information  to  the  guide  required by section 16-315 of this
      chapter; and
        3. remove non-designated materials from the containers  of  designated
      source  separated recyclable materials before such containers are placed
      at the curbside for collection and ensure that the designated  materials
      are placed at the curbside in the manner prescribed by the department.
        With  respect  to solid waste generated by households in the aforesaid
      buildings, the obligations of an owner, net lessee or person  in  charge
      of  such building under this chapter shall be limited to those set forth
      in this subdivision and subdivisions d and g of this  section  or  rules
      promulgated pursuant to such subdivisions.
        g.  The  commissioner shall adopt and implement rules for any building
      containing four or more dwelling units in which the amount of designated
      materials placed out for collection is significantly less than what  can
      reasonably  be  expected  from  such building. These rules shall require
      residential  generators,  including  tenants,  owners,  net  lessees  or
      persons in charge of such building to use transparent bags or such other
      means of disposal the commissioner deems appropriate to dispose of solid
      waste  other  than  the designated recyclable materials. Upon request of
      the owner, net lessee or person in charge of such building, and  if  the
      commissioner  determines that such owner, net lessee or person in charge
      of such building has complied with this subdivision,  subdivision  d  of
      this  section and, as applicable, subdivision e or subdivision f of this
      section or rules promulgated pursuant to such subdivisions and that  the
      amount  of  designated  materials  placed  out  for  collection  remains
      significantly less than  what  can  reasonably  be  expected  from  such
      building,  the  department  may  develop  a  schedule  to conduct random
      inspections to facilitate compliance with the provisions of this chapter
      by tenants of such building, provided that lawful inspections may  occur
      at  reasonable times without notice to ensure compliance by the tenants,
      owner, net lessee or person in charge of such building.
        h. 1. In calculating the extent to which the department  has  met  the
      recycling  percentage  goals set forth in paragraph one of subdivision a
      of this section, the department shall include in  its  calculations  all
      curbside  and  institutional  recycling it collects, including materials
      collected from households, schools, not-for-profit institutions and city
    
      agencies, and all recyclable materials collected as part of  the  public
      space  recycling program pursuant to section 16-310 of this chapter, and
      may include yard waste collected pursuant  to  section  16-308  of  this
      chapter and any other material collected for composting pursuant to this
      chapter,  Christmas  trees  collected pursuant to section 16-309 of this
      chapter, clothing and textiles donated or collected pursuant to  section
      16-310.1 of this chapter, household hazardous waste diverted pursuant to
      section  16-310.3  of  this  chapter,  rechargeable  batteries collected
      pursuant to chapter four of this  title,  beverage  containers  returned
      within  the  city  pursuant  to title ten of article twenty-seven of the
      environmental conservation law, electronic waste  collected  within  the
      city  or otherwise diverted from the city's waste stream, including such
      waste collected or diverted pursuant  to  title  twenty-six  of  article
      twenty-seven  of  the  environmental  conservation law, and plastic bags
      collected within the city or otherwise diverted from  the  city's  waste
      stream,  including  such  plastic bags collected or diverted pursuant to
      title  twenty  seven  of  article  twenty  seven  of  the  environmental
      conservation  law.  Only recyclable materials specifically enumerated in
      this paragraph shall be counted for purposes of calculating  the  extent
      to which the department has met the recycling percentage goals set forth
      in paragraph one of subdivision a of this section.
        2.  In  calculating  the  extent  to  which the department has met the
      recycling percentage goals set forth in paragraph two of  subdivision  a
      of  this  section,  the department shall include in its calculations all
      curbside and institutional recycling it  collects,  including  materials
      collected from households, schools, not-for-profit institutions and city
      agencies,  and  all recyclable materials collected as part of the public
      space recycling program pursuant to section 16-310 of this chapter.
        3. In calculating the extent to  which  the  department  has  met  the
      recycling  percentage  goals  set  forth  in  paragraphs  one and two of
      subdivision  a  of  this  section,  the  department  shall  not  include
      recycling   of   abandoned  vehicles  or  recycling  from  lot  cleaning
      operations, asphalt  and  mill  tailings,  construction  and  demolition
      debris  or  other  commercial recycling programs. The commissioner shall
      not designate any such materials  as  recyclable  materials  under  this
      section  for  purposes of calculating the extent to which the department
      has met such recycling percentage goals.
        4. In calculating the percent of the  department-managed  solid  waste
      stream  recycled  in  connection  with the percentage goals set forth in
      paragraph one of subdivision a of this  section,  the  department  shall
      ensure  that  any quantity of material counted as recycled must be fully
      included in the calculation of the city's total department-managed solid
      waste stream.
        5. All data used to make calculations pursuant to paragraphs  one  and
      two  of  this  subdivision  shall  be made available on the department's
      website  in  raw  form  disaggregated  by  material  type  and  using  a
      non-proprietary  format  on  a  monthly  basis,  or, if such data is not
      generated by the department, within one month from  the  date  that  the
      department receives reports of such information.
        i.  In  the  event  that  the  department  does not meet any recycling
      percentage goal set forth in paragraphs one or two of subdivision  a  of
      this  section  by  the  dates  specified  therein, the department shall,
      within sixty days of the date for meeting such  goal,  expand  recycling
      outreach  and  education  and shall take such other appropriate measures
      including, but not limited to, directing such outreach and education  to
      the  neighborhoods  and community districts in which recycling diversion
      rates fall below the median city recycling diversion rate and consulting
      with the council to explore additional measures to  meet  the  recycling
    
      percentage  goals  set forth in such subdivision. In expanding recycling
      outreach and education, the department may work with other  agencies  or
      entities designated for that purpose by the commissioner.
        j.  In  the  event  that  the  department  is  unable  to  achieve two
      consecutive recycling percentage goals set forth in paragraphs  one  and
      two  of subdivision a of this section by the dates specified therein, in
      addition to the requirements of  subdivision  i  of  this  section,  the
      commissioner  shall  retain  a special advisor, who shall be selected by
      the mayor and the speaker,  provided  that  the  commissioner  need  not
      retain such special advisor more than once every three years. Within one
      hundred  twenty  days  of  such  retention,  such adviser shall submit a
      report to the mayor and council recommending  additional  measures  that
      may  be  taken  by  the city following such report in order to meet such
      recycling percentage goals.
        k. 1. Beginning on March  first,  two  thousand  eleven  and  annually
      thereafter, the department shall submit to the mayor and the council and
      make  available  on  its  website, an annual department recycling report
      which shall include provisions  addressing:  the  extent  to  which  the
      department   has  met  the  recycling  percentage  goals  set  forth  in
      paragraphs one and two of subdivision a of this section and including  a
      description   of  the  methodology  used  to  arrive  at  its  recycling
      percentages; city agency recycling pursuant to section  16-307  of  this
      chapter;  department of education recycling pursuant to section 16-307.1
      of this chapter; yard waste composting pursuant  to  section  16-308  of
      this chapter; Christmas tree composting or recycling pursuant to section
      16-309  of  this chapter; the public space recycling program pursuant to
      section 16-310 of this chapter; the  clothing  and  textiles  collection
      program   pursuant  to  section  16-310.1  of  this  chapter;  household
      hazardous waste collected pursuant to section 16-310.3 of  this  chapter
      or  otherwise  collected  by the department; and any composting capacity
      determinations or food  waste  composting  pilot  programs  pursuant  to
      section 16-316.2 of this chapter.
        2.  Beginning  the  year  that  the  department  commences  delivering
      department-managed  recyclable  materials  to  a  designated   recycling
      processing facility, the department shall annually report to the council
      the  cost  to  the city of designating as recyclable materials any rigid
      plastic  containers  not  previously  designated  by  the   commissioner
      pursuant  to  subdivision c of this section, and the then-current market
      value of any such materials.
    
    
    
    
    
    
    

Section 16-305.1
----------------

Section 16-305.1 ::    
        
     
      ยง  16-305.1  Weekly  collection  of designated recyclable materials.  a.
      Weekly collection of designated recyclable materials shall be maintained
      in all local service delivery districts.
        b. Effective July first, two thousand three, and  notwithstanding  any
      inconsistent   provision  of  this  chapter,  the  department  shall  be
      authorized, by written order  of  the  commissioner,  to  implement  and
      maintain alternate week collection of designated recyclable materials in
      all  local service delivery districts, provided that the department may,
      by  written  order  of  the  commissioner,  provide  for  more  frequent
      collection  of  designated  recyclable  materials  in  designated  local
      service delivery districts. Any such written order of  the  commissioner
      implementing  alternate week collection shall expire no later than March
      thirty-first, two thousand four.
        c. For purposes of  this  section  "designated  recyclable  materials"
      shall  mean  solid waste that has been designated by the commissioner as
      recyclable pursuant to section 16-305 or section 16-307 of this chapter.
        d. Nothing in this section shall be construed to require collection of
      designated recyclable materials in such parts of the city or during such
      times of the year that such materials are not otherwise collected.
    
    
    
    
    
    
    

Section 16-306
--------------

Section 16-306 ::    
        
     
        ยง  16-306  Private  carter-collected  waste. a. The commissioner shall
      adopt  and  implement  rules  designating  recyclable   materials   that
      constitute  in  the  aggregate  at  least  one-half  of  all solid waste
      collected  by  private  carters,  and  additional   materials   if   the
      commissioner  determines  that economic markets exist for them. Pursuant
      to subdivision b of this section, such rules shall require generators of
      private carter-collected waste to source separate some  or  all  of  the
      designated materials and to arrange for lawful collection for recycling,
      reuse or sale for reuse by private carters or persons other than private
      carters  of  such  source separated materials. With regard to designated
      materials that are not required by such rules to  be  source  separated,
      generators  of  private carter-collected waste may source separate these
      designated materials and, in any event, shall arrange for  their  lawful
      collection  for recycling, reuse or sale for reuse by private carters or
      persons  other  than  private  carters.  If  a  generator   of   private
      carter-collected  waste has source separated the designated materials in
      accordance with the rules and arranged for  the  lawful  collection  for
      recycling,  reuse  or sale for reuse by private carters or persons other
      than private carters of such source separated materials and, with regard
      to designated materials that are not required by such rules to be source
      separated, arranged for lawful collection for recycling, reuse  or  sale
      for reuse by private carters or persons other than private carters, such
      arrangement  shall  constitute  an affirmative defense to any proceeding
      brought against  the  generator  pursuant  to  section  16-324  of  this
      chapter.
        b.  The  rules  promulgated  pursuant to subdivision a of this section
      shall require that generators of waste collected by businesses  required
      to  be  licensed pursuant to section 16-505 of this code source separate
      the designated materials in such  manner  and  to  such  extent  as  the
      commissioner  determines  to  be necessary to minimize contamination and
      maximize the marketability of such materials. However,  in  promulgating
      such  rules  the  commissioner  shall not require source separation of a
      material unless the commissioner has determined that an economic  market
      exists  for  such  material.  For  the purpose of this section, the term
      "economic market" refers to instances in which the full avoided costs of
      proper collection,  transportation  and  disposal  of  source  separated
      materials  are  equal  to  or  greater  than  the  cost  of  collection,
      transportation and sale of said materials less the amount received  from
      the  sale  of  said  materials.  The  New  York  city business integrity
      commission shall adopt and implement rules requiring businesses licensed
      to remove, collect  or  dispose  of  trade  waste  to  provide  for  the
      collection  of,  and  ensure  the  continued  separation  of, designated
      materials that have been source separated, provide for the separation of
      all other designated materials, and provide for  recycling  of  all  the
      designated  materials.  Rules  promulgated  by  the  business  integrity
      commission pursuant to this subdivision shall be enforced in the  manner
      provided  in  section  16-517  of this code and violations of such rules
      shall be subject to the penalties provided in subdivision a  of  section
      16-515  of  this  code for violation of the provisions of chapter one of
      title 16-A of this code. In addition, the commissioner  shall  have  the
      authority  to  issue notices of violation for any violation of such rule
      and such notices of violation shall be  returnable  in  a  civil  action
      brought in the name of the commissioner before the environmental control
      board  which  shall  impose a penalty not to exceed ten thousand dollars
      for each such violation.
        c. The department shall complete a study of  commercial  recycling  in
      the  city  no  later  than  January  first,  two  thousand  twelve. Such
      commercial recycling study shall focus on the putrescible portion of the
    
      commercial waste stream, and shall include, but need not be limited  to,
      the following: (i) an integration of all data on commercial waste in the
      city  collected  and transported through transfer stations and recycling
      processors;  (ii)  an  assessment  of  current practices, operations and
      compliance with applicable local laws and  rules,  consistent  with  the
      scope  of study set forth in the 2006 Solid Waste Management Plan; (iii)
      estimates of  waste  composition  and  recycling  diversion  rates  from
