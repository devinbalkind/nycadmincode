        e.  The  department  shall approve or disapprove a proposed electronic
      waste management plan submitted by a  manufacturer  within  one  hundred

      electronic waste management plan that does not conform with every one of
      the requirements of this chapter upon application and a showing of  good
      cause  by  such  manufacturer.  If the department approves an electronic
      waste management plan, it shall expeditiously notify the manufacturer of
      the approval in writing. If the  department  disapproves  an  electronic
      waste management plan, it shall expeditiously notify the manufacturer in
      writing of the disapproval and specify the reasons for such disapproval.
      The manufacturer shall have thirty days to resubmit a revised electronic
      waste  management plan after the department notifies the manufacturer of
      its  disapproval.  The  department  shall  approve   or   disapprove   a

      resubmission.
        f. Beginning on July first, two thousand nine, or one  hundred  eighty

      the  requirements  of this section. Any electronic waste management plan
      providing  for  the  sharing  of  resources  must  include  a  list   of
      manufacturers participating in such plan.
        h.  1.  Proposed modifications to a previously approved manufacturer's
      electronic waste management plan shall be submitted  to  the  department
      which  shall  approve  or disapprove such modification within sixty days
      and expeditiously  notify  the  manufacturer  of  its  determination  in
      writing.  If  the  department  disapproves  such  modification, it shall

      shall  have  thirty  days  to  submit  a  revised  modification  to  the
      department.
        2.  At any time, the department may require resubmission of a proposed
      modification where  it  determines  that  the  manufacturer  is  not  in
    
      compliance  with the collection standards as set forth in section 16-424
      of this  chapter.  The  department  shall  approve  or  disapprove  such
      modification in accordance with paragraph one of this subdivision.
        i.  Notwithstanding  the provisions of section 16-423 of this chapter,
      any person who becomes a manufacturer of  covered  electronic  equipment
      subsequent  to  the  effective date of this section may include within a
      submitted electronic waste  management  plan  a  proposed  schedule  for
      compliance  with  the  minimum collection standards set forth in section
      16-424 beyond the respective compliance dates set forth in such section.
      The commissioner may approve such proposed schedule  or  may  approve  a
      modification  to  such  proposed schedule that provides for a reasonable
      compliance time beyond that provided for in such section.
        j. All decisions of the department pursuant to this section  shall  be
      made public.

--------------

Section 16-424 ::    
        
     
        ยง  16-424  Performance  Standards. a. A manufacturer shall demonstrate
      whether, pursuant  to  its  electronic  waste  management  plan,  it  is
      collecting  for  recycling  or  reuse  at  least  its  share  of covered
      electronic equipment. Such manufacturer's share  of  covered  electronic
      equipment  is  determined  by  applying the following minimum collection
      standard percentage by the average annual sales  of  the  manufacturer's
      covered electronic equipment in the city, reported by weight, during the
      previous  three  calendar years; by July 1, 2012, the minimum collection
      standard is twenty-five percent; by July 1, 2015, the minimum collection
      standard is forty-five percent; by July 1, 2018, the minimum  collection
      standard is sixty-five percent.
        b.  For  purposes of calculating achievement of the minimum collection
      standard specified in paragraph a of this  subdivision,  a  manufacturer
      may  count  the  collection  of  a  single  item  of  covered electronic
      equipment as twice its weight when that item is donated free  of  charge
      for  reuse  to  the  New  York  city  department of education, or to any
      not-for-profit corporation, as defined in subparagraphs five or seven of
      subdivision a of section one hundred two of the New York  not-for-profit
      corporation  law,  a  principal mission of which is to assist low-income
      children or families living in city. To qualify for the  donation  reuse
      credit under this subdivision, the covered electronic equipment must be:
      (a)  no  older  than three years old, (b) in full working condition, and
      (c) accepted as a donation by the recipient in writing.
        c. The commissioner may grant an annual waiver, in whole or  in  part,
      from the minimum collection standards set forth in subdivision a of this
      section  where  a  manufacturer  who  has  an  approved electronic waste
      management plan has demonstrated to the commissioner's satisfaction that
      such minimum collection standards could not  be  met  despite  the  best
      efforts  of  the manufacturer because the manufacturer has substantially
      increased the amount of covered electronic  equipment  sold  within  the
      city over the three-year period during which compliance with subdivision
      a  of  this section is to be measured and it was not practicable to meet
      the applicable minimum collection standard.

      plan  is  approved  by  the  department,  whichever  date is later, such
      manufacturer may not sell or otherwise distribute for sale in  the  city
      covered  electronic  equipment  unless  such  equipment has a label that
      identifies such manufacturer.
        b. Beginning July first, two thousand nine or one hundred eighty  days
      after  a  manufacturer's electronic waste management plan is approved by
      the department, whichever date is later, such manufacturer shall provide
      at the point of sale information on how  a  person  can  return  covered
      electronic  equipment  pursuant  to such manufacturer's electronic waste
      management plan. Such information shall include  a  toll-free  telephone
      number  or  internet  website  address describing how covered electronic
      equipment can be returned  pursuant  to  the  manufacturer's  electronic
      waste management plan.
        c.  Beginning July first, two thousand nine, the department shall post
      on its web site  all  information  provided  to  it  from  manufacturers
