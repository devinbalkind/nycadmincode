      street cleaning between the hours of midnight and 6:00 a.m.
        d. In qualifying districts where, pursuant to subdivision  b  of  this
      section, the department has reduced street cleaning or a community board
      has  requested such a reduction, the department shall have the option to
      resume  or  maintain  the  original  street  cleaning  schedule  if  the
      sanitation  district  receives  an  average  score  of  less than ninety
      percent under the mayor's office of operations scorecard program for any
      period of three consecutive months, or if the  average  score  for  such
      sanitation  district  falls  below  ninety  percent over a period of two

----------------

Section 16-118.1 ::    
        
     
        §  16-118.1 Citywide Routing System. a. The department shall implement
      a citywide routing system for residential premises for  the  enforcement
      of  subdivision  two of section 16-118 of this code, as such subdivision
      relates to the cleaning of sidewalks, flagging,  curbstones,  airshafts,
      backyards, courts, alleys and roadway areas by owners, lessees, tenants,
      occupants  or persons in charge of any such premises, and for commercial
      premises for the enforcement of such  subdivision  as  such  subdivision
      relates to cleaning of sidewalks, flagging, curbstones and roadway areas
      by  owners,  lessees,  tenants,  occupants  or persons in charge of such
      premises. The  citywide  enforcement  routing  system  shall  limit  the
      issuance of notices of violation, appearance tickets or summonses within
      any  sub-district  of a local service delivery district to predetermined
      periods of a total of no more than two hours  each  day,  provided  that
      each  such  predetermined period shall be one hour. The department shall
      establish  a  citywide  schedule  of  periods  for  issuing  notices  of
      violation,  appearance  tickets  or summonses for commercial premises in
      each district and shall give written  notice  to  the  owners,  lessees,
      tenants,  occupants  or  persons  in  charge  of  such  premises in each
      district of the periods for the district in  which  their  premises  are
      located  by  the  use  of  flyers,  community  meetings  or  such  other
      techniques as the commissioner reasonably determines to be  useful.  The
      two  one-hour  predetermined  periods  for issuing notices of violation,
      appearance tickets or summonses for residential premises shall  be  from
      8:00 a.m. until 9:00 a.m. and from 6:00 p.m. until 7:00 p.m.
        b.  Notwithstanding  the  provisions of subdivision a of this section,
      the commissioner may provide an additional predetermined period  of  one
      hour  per  day  during which notices of violation, appearance tickets or
      summonses may by issued in  any  sub-district  within  a  local  service
      delivery  district  upon the commissioner's determination that the total
      of two hours otherwise permitted by this section is  not  sufficient  to
      maintain  the  sidewalks,  flagging,  curbstones  and  roadways  in such
      sub-districts in an adequately clean condition. Such determination shall
      be based upon a finding that there has been a  decline  in  the  average
      street  cleanliness ratings compiled by the mayor's office of operations
      for such district for the most recent three-month period as compared  to
      the average street cleanliness ratings compiled by the mayor's office of
      operations  for  the  same  three-month  period  in fiscal year nineteen
      hundred ninety. Notice of any increase in the  number  of  hours  during
      which  notices  of  violation,  appearance  tickets  or summonses can be
      issued or of any change in such hours shall be given by  letter  to  the
      community  board,  the owners, lessees, tenants, occupants or persons in
      charge of any premises in the  affected  sub-districts  within  a  local
      service  delivery  district  and  every  council member representing the
      local service delivery district no less than forty-five  days  prior  to
      the implementation of such increase or change. Any additional notice may
      be  given  by  use  of letters, flyers, community meetings or such other
      techniques as the  commissioner  reasonably  determines  to  be  useful.
      Written notice to a council member shall be sent to the council member's
      district office.
        c. For the purpose of this section, the following terms shall have the
      following  meanings: (i) "local service delivery district" means a local
      service delivery district as described  in  chapter  sixty-nine  of  the
      charter  of  the  city  of New York; (ii) "sub-district" means a section
      within a  local  service  delivery  district  as  described  in  chapter
      sixty-nine of the charter of the city of New York; and (iii) "commercial
      premises"  means  any  premises  abutting the sidewalk at which goods or
      services are sold directly to consumers or other businesses, and may, in
      appropriate instances to be determined by the commissioner, also include
    
      any other class of real property that is used for  the  conduct  of  any
      business,  trade  or  profession;  and (iv) "residential premises" means
      those portions of premises used predominantly for residential  purposes,
      other  than  hotels,  that  abut  the  sidewalk  and  do  not constitute
      commercial premises.
        d. Within fifteen months after the effective date of this section, the
      commissioner shall submit to the mayor and the council a report  on  the
      results  of the citywide enforcement routing system for the twelve month
      period commencing on the first day of the first  full  month  after  the
      effective date of this section.

      such owner.
        (2) Any owner, owner-operator or operator who is found in violation of
      this section in a proceeding before the environmental control board  and
      who  shall  fail  to pay the civil penalty imposed by such environmental
      control board shall be subject to the suspension of his or her  driver's

      environmental protection with respect to wharfs, piers, docks, bulkheads
      and slips located on waterfront property, and navigable waterways.
        d. In the instance where the notice of violation, appearance ticket or
      summons  is  issued  for  a breach of the provisions of subdivision a of
      this section and sets forth thereon civil penalties only,  such  process
      shall  be  returnable  to  the  environmental control board, which board
      shall have the power to impose the civil penalties hereinabove  provided
      in   subdivision   c   of   this   section,   provided   further,  that,

        Notwithstanding  the  foregoing  provisions  establishment  of a claim
      shall not entitle such person to delivery of the  vehicle  if  the  city
      establishes  that  the unlawful dumping for which the vehicle was seized
      was expressly or impliedly permitted by such person.
        f. Rewards. (1) Where a notice  of  violation,  appearance  ticket  or
      summons is issued for a violation of subdivision a of this section based
      upon  a  sworn  statement  by  one  or  more  individuals  and where the
      commissioner determines, in the exercise of his or her discretion,  that
      such sworn statement, either alone or in conjunction with testimony at a
      civil or criminal proceeding or in a proceeding before the environmental
      control board, results in the conviction of or the imposition of a civil
      penalty  upon  any  person  for  a  violation  of  subdivision a of this
      section, the commissioner shall offer as a reward to such individual  or
      individuals an amount that, in the aggregate, is equal to:
        (i) fifty percent of any fine or civil penalty collected; or
        (ii)  five  hundred dollars when a conviction is obtained, but no fine
      or civil penalty is imposed.
        (2) Where a notice of  violation,  appearance  ticket  or  summons  is
      issued  for  a  violation  of  subdivision  a of this section based upon
      information furnished by an individual  or  individuals  and  where  the
      commissioner  determines, in the exercise of his or her discretion, that
      such information, in conjunction with enforcement activity conducted  by
      the department or another governmental entity, results in the conviction
      of  or the imposition of a civil penalty upon any person for a violation
      of subdivision a of this section, the  commissioner  shall  offer  as  a
    
      reward  to  such  individual  or  individuals  an  amount  that,  in the
      aggregate, is:
        (i) up to fifty percent of any fine or civil penalty collected; or
        (ii)  up to five hundred dollars when a conviction is obtained, but no
      fine or civil penalty is imposed.
        In determining the  amount  of  the  reward,  the  commissioner  shall
      consider  factors that include, but are not limited to: (a) the quantity
      and type of the material dumped, deposited or otherwise disposed of; (b)
      the specificity of the information provided, including, but not  limited
      to,  the license plate number, make or model or other description of the
      dump truck or other vehicle alleged to have been used and the  location,
      date  or  time  of  the  alleged  violation; (c) whether the information
      provided by  the  individual  or  individuals  identified  one  or  more
      violations  of  subdivision  a  of  this  section;  and  (d) whether the
      department has knowledge  that  violations  of  subdivision  a  of  this
      section have previously occurred at that location.
        (3)   No   peace  officer,  employee  of  the  department  or  of  the
      environmental control board, or  employee  of  any  governmental  entity
      that,  in conjunction with the department, conducts enforcement activity
      relating to a violation of  subdivision  a  of  this  section  shall  be
      entitled  to obtain the benefit of any such reward or obtain the benefit
      of such reward when acting in the  discharge  of  his  or  her  official
      duties.
        g.  In  addition  to  the  foregoing  penalties  the offender shall be
      required to clear and clean the area  upon  which  the  offender  dumped
      unlawfully  within  ten  days after conviction thereof. In the event the
      offender fails to clear  and  clean  the  area  within  such  time  such
      clearing  and  cleaning  may  be  done  by  the  department or under the
      direction of the department by a private contractor and the cost of same
      shall be billed to the offender. In the event that  the  department  has
      cleaned  or  cleared  the  area, or has caused the area to be cleaned or
      cleared by a private contractor prior to the offender's conviction,  the
      offender  shall  be  responsible  for  the  cost of such clearing and or
      cleaning. Payment by such offender when  required  by  this  subdivision
      shall be made within ten days of demand by the department.
        h.  The  commissioner  shall  post  a  sign  in  any  area  where  the
      commissioner deems appropriate because of instances of illegal  dumping.
      Such  sign  shall state the penalties for illegal dumping and the reward
      provisions therein.

        §  16-120 Receptacles for the removal of waste material. a. The owner,
      lessee, agent, occupant or  other  person  who  manages  or  controls  a
      building  or dwelling shall provide and maintain in accordance with this
      section separate receptacles for the deposit of incinerator residue  and
      ashes;  refuse,  and liquid waste. The receptacles shall be provided for
      the exclusive  use  of  each  building  or  dwelling  and  shall  be  of
      sufficient  size  and  number  to contain the wastes accumulated in such
      building  or  dwelling  during  a  period  of  seventy-two  hours.   The
      receptacles shall be made of metal or other material of a grade and type
      acceptable  to  the  department,  the  department  of  health and mental
      hygiene and the department  of  housing  preservation  and  development.
      Receptacles  used  for  liquid  waste shall be constructed so as to hold
      their contents without leakage. Metal containers shall be provided  with
      tight fitting metal covers.
        b.  Ashes  and incinerators residue, refuse and liquid wastes shall be
      separated and placed  into  separate  receptacles.  No  receptacle  when
      filled shall weigh more than one hundred pounds.
        c.  Incinerator,  residue,  ashes,  refuse  and  liquid waste shall be
      stored in the building or dwelling or at the rear  of  the  building  or

      hygiene or the department of housing preservation and development  until
      time  for  removal  and  kept  in  tightly  covered metal receptacles or
      containers made of other materials of a type and grade acceptable to the
      department, department of health and mental hygiene, and the  department
      of  housing  preservation  and development. After the contents have been
      removed by the department or other  collection  agency  any  receptacles
      remaining  shall  be  removed from the front of the building or dwelling
      before 9:00 p.m. on the day of collection, or if such collection  occurs
      after  4:00 p.m., then before 9:00 a.m. on the day following collection.
      The receptacles shall at all times be kept covered or closed and kept in
      a manner satisfactory to the department, the department  of  health  and
      mental  hygiene, and in the case of residential premises, the department
      of  housing  preservation  and  development.  No  receptacles,   refuse,
      incinerator  residue  or  ashes,  or liquid waste shall be kept so as to
      create a nuisance. Yard sweepings, hedge cuttings, grass, leaves, earth,
      stone or bricks shall not be mixed with household wastes.

      material  shall  be kept and placed for collection in the same manner as
      the receptacles.
        e. No person shall deposit household or commercial  refuse  or  liquid
      wastes in a public litter basket placed on the streets by the department
      or  any  other  person. There shall be a rebuttable presumption that the
      person whose name, or other  identifying  information,  appears  on  any
      household or commercial refuse or liquid wastes deposited in such public
      litter basket violated this subdivision.
        f.  Any  person  violating  the  provisions  of  this  section, except
      subdivision e, shall be liable for a civil  penalty  of  not  less  than
      twenty-five  nor  more than one hundred dollars for the first violation,
      not less than one hundred dollars nor more than two hundred dollars  for
      a second violation within any twelve-month period, and not less than two

      civil penalty of not less than one hundred dollars nor more  than  three
      hundred dollars for the first violation, not less than two hundred fifty
      dollars nor more than three hundred fifty dollars for a second violation
    
      within  any  twelve-month  period, and not less than three hundred fifty
      dollars nor more than four hundred dollars for  a  third  or  subsequent
      violation within any twelve month period.
        g. In the instance where a notice of violation is issued for breach of
      the  provisions  of this section such process shall be returnable to the
      environmental control board, which shall have the power  to  impose  the
      civil penalties provided in subdivision f of this section.
        h. In the event that a person fails to answer such notice of violation
      within  the  time  provided therefor by the environmental control board,
      that person shall become liable for additional penalties. The additional
      penalties shall not exceed three hundred dollars for each violation.
        i.  Nothing  herein  contained  shall  be  construed   to   supersede,
      substitute  for  or  abrogate  the  provisions  of  article  one hundred

      medical  information privileged under the laws of this state without all
      authorizations required by such laws,  and  that  such  commissioner  or
      agent  shall  make reasonable efforts not to interfere with patient care
      activities. Such entry may be made without a warrant during regular  and
      usual  business  hours  upon  property used for nonresidential purposes,
      including  but  not  limited  to  the  provision  of  health,   medical,
      pharmaceutical or laboratory services, provided that such use is related
      to the generation, storage or disposal of regulated medical waste, or at
      other  times  upon  such property in response to any immediate threat to
      the health or safety of one or more individuals, or of the public,  that
      arises  from  the  generation,  storage or disposal of regulated medical
      waste  upon  such  property.  Warrantless  inspection  or  investigation
      pursuant  to  this  subdivision  shall extend only to: (i) waste storage
      areas;  (ii)  documents  or  records  relating  to  storage,  treatment,
      transportation   or  disposal  of  regulated  medical  waste,  including
      documents or records required  to  be  maintained  by  local,  state  or
      federal  law;  (iii)  bags  and containers for the disposal of regulated
      medical waste; (iv) documents or  records  identifying  the  number  and
      origin  of specimens of human tissues, organs and fluids that constitute
      regulated  medical  waste,  other  than   records   containing   medical
    
      information  privileged  under the laws of this state; and (v) any other
      inspection or investigation necessary to respond to an immediate  threat
      to  the  health  or safety of one or more individuals, or of the public,
      arising  from generation, storage or disposal of regulated medical waste
      upon  such  property.  Refusal  to  permit  entry   pursuant   to   this
      subdivision,  where  the commissioner of sanitation or health and mental
      hygiene or an authorized agent  of  such  commissioner  has  obtained  a
      warrant  for  such entry or is authorized by this subdivision to inspect
      or investigate without a warrant, shall be a misdemeanor  punishable  by
      not  more  than  thirty days imprisonment, or by a fine of not more than
      one hundred dollars or both.
        h. 1. In addition to any other enforcement  procedures  authorized  by
      law,  the commissioner, with the written approval of the commissioner of
      health and mental hygiene, shall be authorized to order in writing  that
      premises  on which activity in violation of this section is occurring be
      closed if the  commissioner  finds  that  continuing  activity  on  such
      premises  would  result  in generation, storage or disposal of regulated
      medical waste or other medical waste in  a  manner  posing  an  imminent
      threat  to  the  public  health  or  safety,  provided  that no facility
      licensed, permitted or certificated pursuant to article twenty-eight  of
      the  public  health  law or part thereof or facility providing inpatient
      services or part thereof may be closed  pursuant  to  this  subdivision.
      Such premises may be opened at any time by any person otherwise lawfully
      entitled  to  enter  such premises in response to an immediate threat to
      the health or safety of one or more individuals, or of the  public.  For
      the  purpose  of this subdivision, the determination whether an imminent
      threat to the public health or safety exists shall be based  on  factors
      that  include  but  are  not  limited  to: (i) the quantity of regulated
      medical waste, the generation,  storage  or  disposal  of  which  is  in
      violation  of  this  section;  (ii)  the types of such regulated medical
      waste; and (iii) the risk of harm to the public or the environment.
        2. Issuance of an order pursuant to this subdivision may  occur  prior
      to  a hearing and determination whether a violation of the provisions of
      this section has occurred and whether there exists an imminent threat to
      the public health or safety, or  during  such  hearing,  or  up  to  two
      business  days  after the conclusion of such hearing, provided that: (i)
      where such issuance occurs prior to such hearing and determination, such
      hearing shall be held within two business days of such issuance and such
      determination  shall  be  rendered  within  twenty-four  hours  of   the
      conclusion  of such hearing; (ii) where such issuance occurs during such
      hearing, such determination shall be rendered within  twenty-four  hours
      of  the conclusion of such hearing; and (iii) where such issuance occurs
      after the conclusion of such hearing but prior  to  such  determination,
      such  determination  shall  be  made  within  twenty-four  hours of such
      issuance. Any order issued pursuant to this subdivision may continue  in
      effect  after  a  finding  of  violation  and  imminent threat until the
      commission permits such premises to be opened pursuant to paragraph five

        §  16-122. Vehicles and other movable property. a. Legislative intent.
      The need for this legislation is indicated by the ever increasing number
      of abandoned cars in the city of New York. The purpose of  this  section
      is  to punish those persons who abandon and/or remove component parts of

      of  a disabled vehicle shall be allowed a reasonable time, not exceeding
      three hours, in which to remove said vehicle.
        d.  Any  person  convicted  of  a  violation  of  the  provisions   of
      subdivision  b  or  c of this section shall be punished by a fine of not

      street, or any public place.
        f. It shall be unlawful for any person to dismantle, or to remove  any
      component  part of any motor vehicle in any marginal or public street or
      any public area.

        i. In the instance where the notice of violation, appearance ticket or
      summons  is issued for breach of the provisions of this section and sets
      forth thereon civil penalties only, such process shall be returnable  to
      the  environmental  control  board, which shall have the power to impose
      the civil penalties  hereinabove  provided  in  subdivision  h  of  this
      section.
        j.  In  the  event  that  a  violator  fails  to answer such notice of
      violation,  appearance  ticket  or  summons  within  the  time  provided
      therefor  by  the  rules  and  regulations  of the environmental control

        §  16-123  Removal  of  snow,  ice  and  dirt from sidewalks; property
      owners' duties. a. Every  owner,  lessee,  tenant,  occupant,  or  other
      person,  having  charge  of  any  building or lot of ground in the city,
      abutting upon any street where the sidewalk is paved, shall, within four
      hours after the snow ceases to fall, or after the deposit of any dirt or
      other material upon such sidewalk, remove the  snow  or  ice,  dirt,  or
      other  material from the sidewalk and gutter, the time between nine post
      meridian and seven ante meridian not being included in the above  period
      of  four hours. Such removal shall be made before the removal of snow or
      ice from the roadway by the commissioner or subject to  the  regulations
      of  such  commissioner. In the boroughs of Queens and Staten Island, any
      owner, lessee, tenant or occupant or other person who has charge of  any
      ground  abutting  upon  any  paved  street or public place, for a linear
      distance of five hundred feet or  more,  shall  be  considered  to  have
      complied  with  this  section, if such person shall have begun to remove
      the snow or ice from the sidewalk and gutter before  the  expiration  of
      such  four  hours  and shall continue and complete such removal within a
      reasonable time.
        b. In case the snow and ice on the sidewalk shall be  frozen  so  hard
      that  it  cannot  be  removed without injury to the pavement, the owner,
      lessee, tenant, occupant or other person having charge of  any  building
      or  lot  of  ground  as aforesaid, may, within the time specified in the
      preceding subdivision, cause the sidewalk abutting on such  premises  to
      be strewed with ashes, sand, sawdust, or some similar suitable material,
      and  shall,  as  soon thereafter as the weather shall permit, thoroughly
      clean such sidewalks.
        c. Any person  violating  any  provision  of,  or  regulation  adopted
      pursuant to, subdivisions a and b of this section shall be punished by a
      fine  of  not  less  than  ten  dollars  nor more than one hundred fifty
      dollars, imprisonment for not more than ten days, or both.
        d. Whenever any owner,  lessee,  tenant,  occupant,  or  other  person
      having charge of any building or lot of ground, abutting upon any street
      or  public  place where the sidewalk is paved, shall fail to comply with
      the provisions of this section, the commissioner may cause such  removal
      to be made.
        e.  The  expense  of  such removal as to each particular lot of ground
      shall  be  ascertained  and  certified  by  the  commissioner   to   the
      comptroller, who shall pay the same in the same manner as the expense of
      removing  snow  from  the  streets  is  paid.  Upon  the payment of such
      expense, the comptroller shall deliver  a  certificate  thereof  to  the
      council  and  the  amount  of such expense shall be added to and made to
      form a part of the annual taxes of the next ensuing fiscal year  against
      such  property,  and the same shall be collected in and with and as part
      of the annual taxes for such fiscal year.  The  corporation  counsel  is
      directed and may sue for and recover the amount of such expense.
        f. This section shall not be regarded as interfering with the owner of
      any  lots throwing into the roadway of the streets any snow or ice which
      may be removed from the sidewalk or gutter directly  in  front  of  such
      lot.
        g. The term "lot" as used in this section shall include a space not to
      exceed  twenty-five  feet  in  width  fronting the street upon which the
      violation is charged to have been permitted, committed or omitted.
        h. Any person violating the provisions of subdivisions (a) or  (b)  of
      this  section shall be liable and responsible for a civil penalty of not
      less than ten dollars nor more than one hundred fifty  dollars  for  the
      first  violation,  except that for a second violation of subdivision (a)
      or (b) within any twelve-month period such person shall be liable for  a
      civil  penalty  of not less than one hundred fifty dollars nor more than
    
      two hundred fifty dollars and for a third  or  subsequent  violation  of
      subdivision  (a) or (b) within any twelve-month period such person shall
      be liable for a civil penalty of not less than two hundred fifty dollars
      nor more than three hundred fifty dollars.
        i. In the instance where the notice of violation, appearance ticket or
      summons  is issued for breach of the provisions of this section and sets
      forth thereon civil penalties only, such process shall be returnable  to
      the  environmental  control  board, which shall have the power to impose
      the civil penalties  hereinabove  provided  in  subdivision  h  of  this
      section.
        j.  In  the  event  that  a  violator  fails  to answer such notice of
      violation,  appearance  ticket  or  summons  within  the  time  provided
      therefor  by  the  rules  and  regulations  of the environmental control
      board, he or she shall  become  liable  for  additional  penalties.  The
      additional  penalties  shall  not exceed three hundred fifty dollars for
      each violation.

        2. requiring applicants and permittees to disclose to  the  department
      information  determined  by  the  commissioner  to  be necessary for the
      department to fulfill its duties under this title. Such information  may
      include  but need not be limited to financial statements, and any annual

        1. establishing, in consultation with the commissioners of health  and
      environmental  protection,  requirements  appropriate  for protection of
      public  health  and  the  environment  concerning   siting   of   dumps,
      non-putrescible  solid  waste transfer stations, putrescible solid waste
      transfer stations and/or fill material operations in relation  to  other
      such  facilities,  residential  premises and/or other premises for which
      such requirements may be appropriate. Requirements established  pursuant
      to  this  paragraph  shall  be  in  addition  to other applicable siting
      requirements;
        2. limiting  the  hours  of  operation  of  premises  required  to  be
      permitted pursuant to section 16-130 of this chapter;
        3.  prescribing the use of deodorants, and other odor control measures
      as may be needed, at putrescible  solid  waste  transfer  stations  and,
      where appropriate, at other facilities required to be permitted pursuant
      to such section;
        4.  prescribing  the  use  of  ventilation  systems  in fully enclosed

      sorting, storage and compaction of  solid  waste  at  putrescible  solid
      waste transfer stations, and, in the commissioner's discretion, at other
      premises required to be permitted pursuant to this section, be conducted
      within  a  fully enclosed structure. If the commissioner determines that
      such activities would not adversely affect a  residential  area  if  not
      conducted  within  a fully enclosed structure, then the commissioner may
      grant an exemption from such requirement, provided that no exemption may
      be granted in contravention of  regulations  promulgated  by  the  state
      department   of  environmental  conservation  to  regulate  solid  waste
      management facilities or other applicable law. Any person  who,  on  the
      effective  date of this local law, holds a permit for, and conducts such
      activities on, premises where no fully enclosed  structure  exists,  and
      who shall be required to conduct such activities within a fully enclosed
      structure,  may  be  granted  a reasonable time, to be determined by the
      commissioner, to construct such structure.
    
        c. The commissioner shall issue permits  to  such  persons  or  public
      agencies  engaged  in  use of piers or lands or lands under water within
      the city as dumps, non-putrescible  solid  waste  transfer  stations  or
      putrescible  solid  waste  transfer  stations.  The  commissioner  shall
      collect  an annual fee of seven thousand dollars for each permit for any
      such pier or part thereof, or for each piece or parcel of land  or  land
      under  water used as a dump or as a non-putrescible solid waste transfer
      station, and an annual fee of thirteen thousand dollars for each  permit
      for  any  such pier or part thereof, or for each piece or parcel of land
      or land under water used as a putrescible solid waste transfer  station.
      The  commissioner  shall  collect  an  annual  registration fee of seven
      thousand dollars for an intermodal solid waste container  facility.  The
      commissioner  may  by  rule  provide for suspension or revocation of any
      permit or registration issued pursuant to this subdivision for cause  or
      violation of the orders or rules of the commissioner.

      public  agencies  engaged  in use of piers or lands or lands under water
      for fill material operations. The commissioner shall collect a fee every
      six months of twelve hundred fifty dollars for each permit for any  such
      pier  or part thereof, or for each piece or parcel of land or land under
      water where the anticipated or actual aggregate amount of fill  material
      for  grading,  levelling,  surcharging,  compacting  or final dispostion
      during such six-month period is equal to or greater  than  one  thousand
      cubic  yards,  and  a  fee  of  six hundred twenty-five dollars for each
      permit for any such pier or part thereof, or for each piece or parcel of
      land or land under water  where  the  anticipated  or  actual  aggregate
      amount  of fill material for grading, levelling, surcharging, compacting
      or final disposition during such  six-month  period  is  less  than  one
      thousand  cubic  years,  provided  that  no fee shall be charged for the
      first six-month permit issued in a calendar year for any  pier  or  part
      thereof,  or  for each piece or parcel of land or land under water where
      the anticipated or actual aggregate amount of fill material for grading,
      levelling, surcharging, compacting  or  final  disposition  during  such
      six-month   period   is   less  than  three  hundred  cubic  yards.  The
      commissioner may by regulation provide for suspension or  revocation  of
      any  permit  issued pursuant to this paragraph for cause or violation of
      the orders or rules or regulations of the commissioner.  Notwithstanding
      any  other  provision  of  this  section  or  of  section 16-130 of this
      chapter, no permit or fee shall be required of an owner or  occupant  of
      residential  property  engaged  in  a  fill  material  operation on such
      property where the  anticipated  or  actual  aggregate  amount  of  fill
      material  for  grading,  levelling,  surcharging,  compacting  or  final
      disposition during a six-month period is less than three  hundred  cubic
      yards.
        e.  Rules  adopted  by the commissioner pursuant to this section shall
      become effective only after filing  and  publication  as  prescribed  by

      chapter, prior to adoption by the commissioner of a final rule  pursuant
      to subdivision e of section one thousand forty-three of the charter, and
      after   consideration   of   relevant  comments  presented  pursuant  to

      council the draft text of the final rule proposed to be published in the
      City  Record;  the  council  shall have thirty days to comment upon such

Section 16-131.1 ::    
        
     
        §  16-131.1  Issuance,  renewal, suspension and revocation of permits.
      The  commissioner  shall  be  responsible  for  the  issuance,  renewal,
      suspension  and revocation of permits required by section 16-130 of this
      chapter. An application for such a permit shall also be presented by the
      department to the New York city trade waste  commission  for  review  by
      such  commission. The commissioner shall consider the recommendations of
      such commission in making a determination pursuant to this section.
        a. The commissioner, consistent with  article  twenty-three-A  of  the
      correction  law,  may  refuse  to  issue  or  renew a permit required by
      section 16-130 of this chapter, or may, after notice and the opportunity
      to be heard, suspend or revoke such a permit when the applicant for such
      permit or such permittee has been denied a license required  by  section
      16-505 of this code to operate a business for the collection, removal or
      disposal of trade waste or has had such a license revoked for the reason
      that  such  applicant or licensee has been found to lack good character,
      honesty and integrity by the trade  waste  commission  pursuant  to  the
      provisions of title 16-A of this code.
        b.  The  commissioner,  consistent  with article twenty-three-A of the
      correction law, may refuse to issue to an applicant a permit required by
      section 16-130 of this chapter and may, after due notice and hearing, in
      addition to any other  penalties  provided  by  law,  refuse  to  renew,
      suspend  or  revoke  such  permit  upon  the  occurrence  of  any of the
      following conditions:
        1. the applicant or permittee has been convicted of a crime  which  in
      the judgment of the commissioner has a direct relationship to his or her
      fitness  or  ability to perform any of the activities for which a permit
      is required under section 16-130 of this chapter; or
        2. the applicant or  permittee  has  been  found  by  a  court  or  an
      administrative agency of competent jurisdiction to have violated:
        (A)  any  provision  of  section  16-117.1,  16-119, 16-120.1, 16-130,
      16-131, 16-131.2, 16-131.3 or 16-131.5 of this chapter; or
        (B) any provision of article one hundred fifty-seven of the  New  York
      city health code; or
        (C)  any other law or rule related to the conduct, operation or use of
      a dump, non-putrescible solid waste transfer station, putrescible  solid
      waste transfer station or fill material operation; or
        (D)  any  federal  or  state law prohibiting unfair trade practices or
      conduct in restraint of competition, including but not  limited  to  the
      Sherman  Anti-Trust Act (15 U.S.C. §1, §2), the Clayton Act (15 U.S.C. §
      18), the Robinson Patman Act (15 U.S.C. §12 et seq.), the Federal  Trade
      Commission  Act (15 U.S.C. §45 et seq.), and sections 340 et seq. of the
      general business law or an equivalent offense  under  the  laws  of  any
      other jurisdiction; or
        3. the commissioner has determined, after consideration of the results
      of  an  investigation  conducted  pursuant  to  this  section,  that the
      applicant or permittee has operated the business for which a  permit  is
      required by section 16-130 of this chapter in a manner inconsistent with
      the  provisions  of  the  federal or state laws prohibiting unfair trade
      practices  or  conduct  in  restraint  of  competition  set   forth   in
      subparagraph (D) of paragraph two of this subdivision; or
        4.  the  applicant  or permittee has violated or failed to comply with
      any of the conditions for issuance of such permit as  provided  in  this
      chapter or any of the rules promulgated hereunder.
        c.  Where the commissioner or the New York city trade waste commission
      has reasonable cause to believe that a permittee or an applicant  for  a
      permit  required by section 16-130 of this code may lack good character,
      honesty and integrity, such applicant or permittee shall, in addition to
      providing the information required by the rules promulgated pursuant  to
    
      paragraph  two  of  subdivision  a  of section 16-131 of this code, also
      comply with the fingerprinting and disclosure requirements set forth  in
      subdivision  b  of  section  16-508 of this code and pay the fee for the
      investigation  thereof set forth in the rules of the New York city trade
      waste commission. The  commissioner  may,  after  consideration  of  the
      results  of  such  investigation,  refuse  for  the reasons set forth in
      section 16-509 of this code to issue a permit required by section 16-130
      of this chapter and, after notice  and  opportunity  to  be  heard,  may
      revoke  or  suspend any such permit upon a finding that the applicant or
      the permittee lacks good character, honesty and integrity.
        d. For the purposes of this section, "applicant" or "permittee"  shall
      mean  the  business  of  the  applicant  or  permittee and any principal
      thereof, as the term "principal" is defined in section  16-501  of  this
      code.
        e.  The  New  York  city  trade  waste commission or the department of
      investigation may, at  the  request  of  the  commissioner,  assist  the
      commissioner in any investigation conducted pursuant to this section.

Section 16-131.2 ::    
        
     
        §  16-131.2  Additional powers of the commissioner. In addition to any
      other enforcement procedures authorized by law, the  commissioner  shall
      have the powers described in this section.
        a.  The  commissioner may order any person violating section 16-130 or
      16-131 of this chapter or article one hundred  fifty-seven  of  the  New
      York city health code to discontinue such violation immediately.
        b.  1.  If  the commissioner finds that premises for which a permit is
      required pursuant to section 16-130  of  this  chapter  are  being  used
      either without such permit or in a manner which poses an imminent threat
      to  the  public  health  or  safety,  then the commissioner may order in
      writing that (a) such premises be sealed, secured and closed and/or  (b)
      that  equipment,  vehicles  or  other  personal  property  used  on such
      premises be removed or sealed and secured. Upon the  effective  date  of
      such order, no person shall have access to such premises and/or use such
      equipment  except as authorized by the commissioner. Upon such effective
      date,  authorized  officers  and  employees  of  the   department,   the
      department  of  health  and  mental hygiene and the New York city police
      department shall act upon and enforce such order. The finding whether an
      imminent threat to the public health or safety exists shall be based  on
      factors  that  include but are not limited to: (i) the quantity of solid
      waste, or of material listed in subparagraph (b)  of  paragraph  one  of
      subdivision a of section 16-130 of this chapter, that may pose a threat;
      (ii)  the  types  of  solid  waste,  or  of such material listed in such
      subparagraph, that may pose a threat; and/or (iii) the risk of  harm  to
      the  public  or  the  environment.  For  the  purpose of this paragraph:
      "sealed, secured and closed" or "sealed and secured" shall mean the  use
      of  any  means  available  to  render  the premises or any part thereof,
      and/or any equipment, vehicles  or  other  personal  property  contained
      therein,  inaccessible  or  inoperable, including but not limited to the
      use of a padlock or cinder blocks.
        2. Any equipment, vehicles or other personal property removed pursuant
      to an order issued under paragraph one of this subdivision may be stored
      in a garage, pound or other place of safety,  and  the  owner  or  other
      person  lawfully  entitled to the possession of such equipment, vehicles
      or other personal property may be charged with the reasonable costs  for
      removal  and  storage,  payable  prior to the release of such equipment,
      vehicles or  other  personal  property.  Equipment,  vehicles  or  other
      personal  property  not  reclaimed  by such owner or other person within
      ninety days of the notification to such owner or other person that  such
      order  has  been rescinded shall be deemed abandoned and may be disposed
      of by the department at a public auction, provided that vehicles  deemed
      abandoned  shall  be  disposed  of  in  a manner consistent with section
      twelve hundred twenty-four of the  vehicle  and  traffic  law  and  that
      timely  notice  of  any  public  auction shall be provided to any record
      holder of a security interest at the address for such holder  set  forth
      in any instrument recorded in the city of New York.
        3.  Any order to seal, secure and close premises pursuant to paragraph
      one of this subdivision, or to remove  or  seal  and  secure  equipment,
      vehicles  or  other personal property issued pursuant to such paragraph,
      shall contain notice of the right to request  a  hearing  within  thirty
      days of delivery of such order and posting of such order pursuant to the
      first  sentence  of  paragraph four of this subdivision. If a hearing is
      requested within such thirty day period, the order shall be effective as
      set forth in the determination of the commissioner.  If  no  hearing  is
      requested  within such thirty day period the order shall be effective on
      the thirtieth day after such  delivery  and  posting  pursuant  to  such
      sentence.  A  hearing held pursuant to this paragraph shall be conducted
      by the department. The hearing officer shall submit recommended findings
    
      of fact and a recommended decision to the commissioner, who  shall  make
      the  final findings of fact and the final determination. Notwithstanding
      the foregoing provisions of this paragraph, if such order is based  upon
      a finding by the commissioner of an imminent threat to the public health
      or safety, such order may provide that it shall be effective immediately
      upon  posting  pursuant  to the first sentence of paragraph four of this
      subdivision; in such case a hearing shall be held within three  business
      days of a request for such hearing and a determination shall be rendered
      within four business days of the conclusion of such hearing.
        4.  Orders  of  the  commissioner  issued pursuant to this subdivision
      shall be served by delivery of the order  to  the  permittee,  owner  or
      other  person  of  suitable  age  and  discretion  in actual or apparent
      control of the premises, equipment, vehicles or other personal property,
      and shall be posted at the premises that have been sealed,  secured  and
      closed,  or  on  or  in the vicinity of the equipment, vehicles or other
      personal property that has been sealed and secured, or on  the  premises
      from  which  equipment,  vehicles  or  other  personal property has been
      removed. The commissioner shall ensure  that  notice  is  delivered  and
      posted  pursuant  to  this  paragraph, and in addition shall ensure that
      such order is mailed to the  permittee  at  the  residence  or  business
      address  for  such permittee set forth in the records of the department,
      to the record owner of such premises, and any record mortgagee  of  such
      premises, at the address set forth in the recorded instrument and to the
      person  designated  as  owner  or agent of the premises or designated to
      receive real property tax or water bills for the premises at the address
      for such person contained in one of the files compiled by the department
      of finance for the purpose of  the  assessment  or  collection  of  real
      property  taxes  and  water  charges  or  in  the  file  compiled by the
      department of finance from real property transfer forms filed  with  the
      city  register  upon the sale or transfer of real property, to the owner
      of such vehicles at  the  address  for  such  owner  set  forth  in  the
      registration  record  maintained  by  the  department  of motor vehicles
      pursuant to section four hundred one of the vehicle and traffic  law  or
      for vehicles not registered in New York state, such equivalent record in
      the  state  of  registration,  and  to  any  record holder of a security
      interest in equipment,  vehicles  or  other  personal  property  at  the
      address for such holder set forth in any instrument recorded in the city
      of  New  York,  and  at  the  address  for  such holder set forth in any
      certificate of title issued by the department of motor vehicles pursuant
      to title ten of the vehicle and traffic law.  In  addition,  such  order
      shall  be  mailed  to the owner of equipment or personal property, other
      than vehicles, at any address for such owner provided by  the  permittee
      or  the  person  to  whom  such order is delivered pursuant to the first
      sentence of this paragraph.
        5. Where premises have been sealed, secured and closed  or  equipment,
      vehicles,  or  other  personal  property  has been sealed and secured or
      removed by order of the commissioner issued pursuant to paragraph one of
      this subdivision, the permittee, owner or other person lawfully entitled
      to the possession of  the  premises  or  equipment,  vehicles  or  other
      personal   property,  may  at  any  time  provide  to  the  commissioner
      assurances that the conditions which caused the issuance of  such  order
      have  been  corrected and will not reoccur and any necessary permit will
      be obtained. Upon receipt of such  assurances,  the  commissioner  shall
      within  two business days either issue a written determination that such
      conditions have not been corrected, or are likely  to  reoccur,  or,  if
      such  assurances  are satisfactory, rescind such order; provided that no
      equipment, vehicles or other personal property shall be  released  after
    
      such  rescission  unless  costs for removal and storage owed pursuant to
      paragraph two of this subdivision have been paid.
        6. (a) No person shall remove or cause to be removed the seal from, or
      otherwise  enter  without the commissioner's authorization, any premises
      sealed by order of the commissioner issued pursuant to paragraph one  of
      this subdivision.
        (b)  No  person  shall remove or cause to be removed the seal from, or
      otherwise tamper with or use, any equipment, vehicles or other  personal
      property  sealed  by  order  of  the  commissioner  issued  pursuant  to
      paragraph one of this subdivision.
        (c) Any person who violates this paragraph shall  upon  conviction  be
      guilty  of  a  misdmeanor  and  be  punished  by  a  fine  not to exceed
      twenty-five thousand dollars, or by imprisonment for a term of not  more
      than one year, or by both such fine and imprisonment.

Section 16-131.3 ::    
        
     
        § 16-131.3 Removal or abatement of public nuisance. a. 1. Whenever the
      commissioner  finds  that  there  exists,  on  premises  required  to be
      permitted pursuant to  section  16-130  of  this  chapter,  a  condition
      hazardous  to public health or safety, the commissioner may declare such
      premises to be a public nuisance and order the permittee and/or owner to
      remove or abate such public nuisance as such  order  shall  specify.  It
      shall be the duty of such permittee and/or owner upon whom such an order
      has  been  served  to remove or abate such public nuisance in the manner
      and in the time provided by such order.
        2. For  the  purpose  of  this  subdivision,  the  finding  whether  a
      condition hazardous to the public health or safety exists shall be based
      on  factors  that  include  but  are not limited to: (i) the quantity of
      solid waste, or of material listed in subparagraph (b) of paragraph  one
      of  subdivision  a  of section 16-130 of this chapter, that may create a
      condition hazardous to the public health or safety; (ii)  the  types  of
      solid  waste,  or of such material listed in such subparagraph, that may
      create such a condition; and/or (iii) the risk of harm to the public  or
      the environment.
        b. 1. An order of the commissioner issued pursuant to subdivision a of
      this  section  shall  specify  the  work to be performed and shall fix a
      reasonable time for compliance which shall not be less than thirty  days
      from  the  date  of  service  of  such  order,  or twenty days after the
      commissioner's  determination  pursuant  to  paragraph  four   of   this
      subdivision,  whichever  is  later. Such order shall contain a statement
      that upon the failure of the permittee and/or owner of such premises  to
      comply  with  the  commissioner's  order  within  the  stated  time, the
      department may perform the work specified in the order or the department
      may apply for a court order directing such  permittee  and/or  owner  to
      comply  with  the  commissioner's  order  or directing the department to
      perform the work specified in the commissioner's order.  Such  statement
      shall   also  indicate  that  if  any  of  the  work  specified  in  the
      commissioner's order is performed by or on behalf of the department, the
      expense incurred in performing such work shall  be  a  debt  recoverable
      from  such  permittee and/or owner and a lien on the premises, including
      the land and buildings, with respect to which such order was issued.
        2. Service of such order shall be  made  upon  such  permittee  and/or
      owner  by  personal  service  or by certified mail addressed to the last
      known address of such permittee and/or owner or in any  manner  provided
      for  service  of  process by article three of the civil practice law and
      rules.  The commissioner may serve a copy of such order on any mortgagee
      or lienor of record in the same manner.
        3. A copy of such order shall be filed with the office of the register
      in the county in which the premises with respect to which such order was
      issued are situated, provided, that in the county of Richmond, such copy
      shall be filed with the county clerk.
        4. Within fifteen days after service of such order upon the  permittee
      and/or  owner, such permittee and/or owner or a mortgagee or lienor upon
      whom a copy of such order has been served may request  a  hearing.  Such
      hearing  shall be conducted by the department. The hearing officer shall
      submit recommended findings of fact and a recommended  decision  to  the
      commissioner,  who  shall  make the final findings of fact and the final
      determination.
        c.  If  the  permittee  and/or  owner  fails  to   comply   with   the
      commissioner's  order  within  the time fixed for compliance pursuant to
      subdivision b of this section,  the  department  may  perform  the  work
      specified in the order.
        d.  As an alternative to the remedy set forth in subdivision c of this
      section, if  the  permittee  and/or  owner  fails  to  comply  with  the
    
      commissioner's  order  within  the time fixed for compliance pursuant to
      subdivision b of this section, the commissioner may apply to  any  court
      of  competent  jurisdiction,  upon such notice and in such manner as the
      court shall direct, for an order directing the permittee and/or owner to
      comply  with  the  commissioner's  order  or directing the department to
      perform the work specified in the commissioner's order.
        e. 1. Whenever the commissioner finds that there  exists  on  premises
      declared  to  be  a  public  nuisance  pursuant to subdivision a of this
      section a condition that poses an imminent threat to the  public  health
      or  safety  which  requires  immediate remedial action, the commissioner
      may, in his or her discretion,  order  the  permittee  and/or  owner  to
      remove or abate such public nuisance, or direct the department to remove
      or  abate  such  public  nuisance, and, notwithstanding any provision of
      this section to the contrary, no hearing shall be required  to  be  held
      before  the  time  fixed  in  the  order  for  compliance, or before the
      department removes or abates such public  nuisance,  and  the  time  for
      compliance  provided  in  paragraph one of subdivision b of this section
      shall not apply to an order issued pursuant to this subdivision.  Notice
      of  an  order  or direction issued pursuant to this subdivision shall be
      served in the manner prescribed in paragraph two  of  subdivision  b  of
      this section, provided, that if the commissioner determines that service
      in such manner would result in delay prejudicial to the public health or
      safety,  then  the  commissioner  may  serve  such order or direction by
      delivery of a copy thereof to a person of suitable age and discretion in
      actual or apparent control of the premises to which it relates,  or,  if
      service  cannot be made in such manner, by copy posted upon the premises
      to which it  relates.  An  order  or  direction  served  in  the  manner
      prescribed  in this subdivision shall take effect when delivered or when
      posted. After such order or direction  takes  effect,  the  commissioner
      shall  serve  such  order  or  direction  in  the  manner  prescribed in
      paragraph two of subdivision b of this section. Such additional  service
      shall include notice of the earlier service of such order or direction.
        2. Notwithstanding any other provision of this section, if an order or
      direction  is  issued  pursuant  to paragraph one of this subdivision, a
      hearing shall be held within three business days of a request  for  such
      hearing  and a determination shall be rendered within four business days
      of the conclusion of such hearing. Such hearing shall  be  conducted  by
      the department. The hearing officer shall submit recommended findings of
      fact  and a recommended decision to the commissioner, who shall make the
      final findings of fact and the final determination.
        3. For the  purpose  of  this  subdivision,  the  finding  whether  an
      imminent  threat to the public health or safety exists shall be based on
      factors that include but are not limited to: (i) the quantity  of  solid
      waste,  or  of  material  listed in subparagraph (b) of paragraph one of
      subdivision a of section 16-130 of this chapter, that may pose a threat;
      (ii) the types of solid waste,  or  of  such  material  listed  in  such
      subparagraph,  that  may pose a threat; and/or (iii) the risk of harm to
      the public or the environment.
        f. The commissioner may request the assistance of  the  department  of
      health  or  any  city,  state  or  federal agency to perform work on its
      behalf pursuant to this section.
        g. 1. The expense of the department with respect to any work performed
      by or on behalf of the department pursuant to subdivisions c, d and e of
      this section shall be a debt recoverable from the permittee and/or owner
      and a lien upon the premises, including the  land  and  buildings,  with
      respect to which such work was performed.
        2.  The  department shall keep a record of all work performed by or on
      behalf of the department. Such records shall be accessible to the public
    
      during business hours. Within  thirty  days  after  the  issuance  of  a
      purchase or work order for such work, such order shall be entered on the
      records  of  the  department.  Such entry shall constitute notice to all
      parties.
        3.  All  such  expenses shall constitute a lien upon the premises when
      the amount thereof shall have been definitely computed as a statement of
      account by the department and the department shall cause to be filed  in
      the  office  of the city collector an entry of the account stated in the
      book in which such charges against the premises are to be entered.  Such
      lien  shall have a priority over all other liens and encumbrances on the
      premises except for the lien of taxes and assessments. However, no  lien
      created  pursuant to this section shall be enforced against a subsequent
      purchaser  in  good  faith  or  mortgagee  in  good  faith  unless  such
      transaction occurred after the date of entry of a purchase or work order
      on  the  records  of  the  department  pursuant to paragraph two of this
      subdivision.
        4. A notice thereof stating the amount  due  and  the  nature  of  the
      charge shall be mailed by the city collector within five days after such
      entry  to the last known address of the person whose name appears on the
      records in the office of the city collector as being the owner or  agent
      or  as the person designated by the owner to receive tax bills or, where
      no name appears, to the premises, addressed to either the owner  or  the
      agent.  Such notice shall have stamped or printed thereon a reference to
      this section.
        5. If such charge is not paid within thirty  days  from  the  date  of
      entry,  it  shall  be the duty of the city collector to receive interest
      thereon at the rate of  interest  applicable  to  such  property  for  a
      delinquent  tax on real property to be calculated to the date of payment
      from the date of entry.
        6. Such charge and the interest thereon shall continue  to  be,  until
      paid,  a lien on the premises. Such charge and interest may be collected
      and the lien thereof may be foreclosed in the manner provided by law for
      the collection and foreclosure of taxes, sewer rents,  sewer  surcharges
      and  water  charges  due  and  payable to the city and the provisions of
      chapter four of title eleven of the code shall apply to such charges and
      the interest thereon and the lien thereof.
        7. (a) In any proceedings  to  enforce  or  discharge  the  lien,  the
      validity  of the lien shall not be subject to challenge based on (i) the
      lawfulness of the work done; or (ii) the propriety and accuracy  of  the
      items  of  expenses  for  which a lien is claimed, except as provided in
      this paragraph.
        (b) No such challenge may be made except  by  (i)  the  owner  of  the
      property, or (ii) a mortgagee or lienor whose mortgage or lien would but
      for  the  provisions of this section have priority over the department's
      lien.
        (c) An issue specified in subparagraph (a) which was decided or  could
      have  been contested in a prior court proceeding to secure a court order
      pursuant to  subdivision  d  of  this  section  shall  not  be  open  to
      reexamination,  but  if any mortgagee or lienor of record was not served
      with  an  order  of  the  commissioner  pursuant  to  paragraph  two  of
      subdivision b and with notice of such proceeding, his or her mortgage or
      lien  shall  have the same priority over the lien of the department that
      it would have had but for the provisions of this section.
        8. In addition to establishing a lien, the department may recover such
      expenses and interest by bringing an action against the permittee and/or
      owner. The institution of such action shall not suspend or bar the right
      to pursue any other remedy provided by law  for  the  recovery  of  such
      debt.
    
        h.  Nothing  contained  in this section shall be construed to restrict
      authority to provide for the abatement of a  public  nuisance  conferred
      upon any agency of the city by any other provision of law.
        i.  For  purposes of this section, "owner" means a person having title
      to any premises or structure; a tenant, lessee or occupant; a  mortgagee
      or  vendee  in  possession;  a  trustee in bankruptcy; a receiver or any
      other person having legal  ownership  or  control  of  any  premises  or
      structure.

----------------

Section 16-131.4 ::    
        
     
        §  16-131.4  Impoundment and forfeiture. a. Any equipment, vehicles or
      other personal property that has been used or is being used  to  violate
      the  provisions  of section 16-130, 16-131, 16-131.2 or 16-131.3 of this
      chapter or article one hundred fifty-seven of the New York  city  health
      code  may  be impounded by the department pending forfeiture pursuant to
      the provisions of  this  section.  Such  equipment,  vehicles  or  other
      personal property shall be released by the end of the following business
      day  unless  the  department ascertains either (i) that the owner of the
      premises upon which the equipment, vehicles or other  personal  property
      has  been or is being used has not obtained a permit required by section
      16-130 of this chapter, (ii) that the owner has  been  convicted  of  or
      found  liable  for  a  violation  of section 16-130, 16-131, 16-131.2 or
      16-131.3 of this chapter, or article one hundred fifty-seven of the  New
      York  city health code, in a civil or criminal judicial proceeding or in
      a proceeding  before  an  agency  of  competent  jurisdiction  and  such
      violation was committed within eighteen months prior to the violation of
      law  for  which  such equipment, vehicles or other personal property was
      impounded, or (iii) that the  alleged  violation  of  such  sections  or
      article  for  which  such equipment, vehicles or other personal property
      was   impounded   involves   the    unlawful    handling,    processing,
      transportation,  disposal  or  storage  of  a  material  identified as a
      hazardous waste or an acute hazardous waste in  regulations  promulgated
      pursuant to section 27-0903 of the environmental conservation law.
        b.  Notice  of  impoundment  and  intended  forfeiture shall be served
      together with the notice of the violation of law  for  which  equipment,
      vehicles  or  other  personal  property was impounded. Such notice shall
      contain notice of the right to request a hearing before  the  department
      with  respect  to whether there is reasonable cause to believe that such
      equipment, vehicles or  other  personal  property  will  be  subject  to
      forfeiture;  a  hearing  shall be provided within three business days of
      such request, and a determination shall be rendered within four business
      days of the conclusion of such hearing. The hearing officer shall submit
      recommended  findings  of  fact  and  a  recommended  decision  to   the
      commissioner,  who  shall  make the final findings of fact and the final
      determination.  If  the  commissioner  determines  that  there  is   not
      reasonable  cause  to  believe  that  such  equipment, vehicles or other
      personal property will be subject to forfeiture,  the  department  shall
      release  such  equipment,  vehicles  or  other personal property, and no
      charges or fees shall be imposed as a condition of such release. If  the
      commissioner  determines  that there is reasonable cause to believe that
      such equipment, vehicles or other personal property will be  subject  to
      forfeiture,  the department may retain such equipment, vehicles or other
      personal property pending forfeiture pursuant to the provisions of  this
      section.  If  after  adjudication of the violation of law for which such
      equipment, vehicles or other personal property was impounded  the  court
      or  agency  of competent jurisdiction finds the respondent not guilty of
      or not liable for such violation,  such  equipment,  vehicles  or  other
      personal  property  shall  be released forthwith, and no charges or fees
      shall be imposed as a condition of such release. If  after  adjudication
      of  such violation of law, the court or agency of competent jurisdiction
      finds the respondent guilty of or liable for such violation,  then  upon
      demand  of  the  respondent  the  department  shall  either release such
      equipment, vehicles or other  personal  property  upon  payment  of  all
      outstanding  fines  and civil penalties, and removal charges and storage
      fees, or commence a  forfeiture  proceeding  pursuant  to  this  section
      within ten days after such demand.
        c.  In  addition  to any other penalties provided in this section, the
      interest of an owner  in  any  equipment,  vehicles  or  other  personal
    
      property  impounded  pursuant  to subdivision a of this section shall be
      subject to forfeiture upon notice and judicial determination thereof  if
      such  owner  either  (i)  has  not obtained a permit required by section
      16-130  of  this chapter and has been convicted of or found liable for a
      violation of section 16-130,  16-131,  16-131.2,  or  16-131.3  of  this
      chapter,  or article one hundred fifty-seven of the New York city health
      code, in a civil or criminal judicial  proceeding  or  in  a  proceeding
      before  an  agency of competent jurisdiction, (ii) has been convicted of
      or found liable for a  violation  of  one  of  such  sections,  or  such
      article,  two  or more times, in a civil or criminal judicial proceeding
      or in a proceeding before such agency, both  of  which  violations  were
      committed  within  an eighteen month period, or (iii) has been convicted
      of or found liable for a violation of  one  of  such  sections  or  such
      article  in  a  civil or criminal judicial proceeding or in a proceeding
      before such agency where such violation involved the unlawful  handling,
      processing, transportation, disposal or storage of a material identified
      as  a  hazardous  waste  or  an  acute  hazardous  waste  in regulations
      promulgated  pursuant  to   section   27-0903   of   the   environmental
      conservation law.
        d.  Except  as hereinafter provided, the city agency having custody of
      equipment,  vehicles  or  other  personal   property,   after   judicial
      determination of forfeiture, shall no sooner than thirty days after such
      determination  upon  a notice of at least five days, sell such forfeited
      equipment, vehicles or other personal property at public sale,  provided
      that  no  sooner  than  thirty  days  after  judicial  determination  of
      forfeiture or the date  of  final  determination  of  a  claim  asserted
      pursuant  to  this subdivision, whichever is later, the city may instead
      convert such equipment, vehicles or other personal property to  its  own
      use.  Any  person,  other  than  an  owner  whose  interest is forfeited
      pursuant to this section,  who  establishes  a  right  of  ownership  in
      equipment,  vehicles  or  other  personal  property,  including  a  part
      ownership or security interest, shall be entitled  to  delivery  of  the
      equipment, vehicles or other personal property if such person:
        1.  redeems  the ownership interest which was subject to forfeiture by
      payment to the city of the value thereof; and
        2. pays the reasonable expenses of  the  safekeeping  of  the  vehicle
      between the time of seizure and such redemption; and
        3.  asserts a claim within thirty days after judicial determination of
      forfeiture.
        Notwithstanding the foregoing  provisions  establishment  of  a  claim
      shall  not  entitle such person to delivery if the city establishes that
      the activity in violation of law for which the  equipment,  vehicles  or
      other  property  was seized was expressly or impliedly permitted by such
      person.
        e. For purposes of this section, "owner" means a person, other than  a
      holder  of  a  security  interest,  having  the  property in or title to
      equipment, vehicles  or  other  personal  property,  including  but  not
      limited  to  a  person  entitled  to  use  and  possession of equipment,
      vehicles or other personal property subject to a  security  interest  in
      another  person  and also includes any lessee or bailee having exclusive
      use thereof.

      subject  to  the  approval  of  the board of estimate, to lease, rent or
      otherwise grant advertising space to any person on any basket, container
      or receptacle placed  in  a  public  place  by  the  department  or  its

      section 16-129, 16-130, 16-131, 16-131.2, 16-131.3 or 16-131.5  of  this
      chapter,  or article one hundred fifty-seven of the New York city health
      code, shall be guilty of a  misdemeanor,  and  upon  conviction  thereof
      shall  be punished by a fine not to exceed twenty-five thousand dollars,
      or by imprisonment for a term of not more than one year, or by both such
      fine and imprisonment.
        2. In addition to any other penalties provided under paragraph one  of
      this  subdivision,  any  violation  of  section  16-129, 16-130, 16-131,
      16-131.2, 16-131.3 or 16-131.5 of this chapter, or article  one  hundred
      fifty-seven  of  the New York city health code, shall be punishable by a
      civil penalty of not less than twenty-five hundred dollars nor more than
      ten thousand dollars  for  the  first  violation,  not  less  than  five
      thousand  nor  more  than  ten thousand dollars for the second violation
      committed in a period of three years, and ten thousand dollars  for  the
      third and any subsequent violation committed in such period. Every owner
      of  premises  or of equipment, vehicles or other personal property shall
      be punishable by a civil penalty of not less  than  twenty-five  hundred
      dollars  nor more than ten thousand dollars for the first violation, not

      period  by  any  person  using or operating the same, in the business of
      such owner or otherwise, with the permission,  express  or  implied,  of
      such  owner.  In  the  case  of  a  continuing  violation,  every  day's
      continuance thereof  may  be  deemed  to  be  a  separate  and  distinct
      violation.  Civil penalties shall be recovered in a civil action brought
      in  the  name  of  the  commissioner  or  in  a  proceeding  before  the
      environmental  control  board, provided however that civil penalties for
      violations of article one hundred  fifty-seven  of  the  New  York  city
      health  code  may only be recovered as provided by law for violations of
      the New York city health code. As used in this paragraph, "owner"  means
      a  person,  other  than  a  holder  of  a  security interest, having the
      property in or  title  to  premises  or  equipment,  vehicles  or  other

      includes any lessee or bailee having exclusive use thereof.
        b.  1. Any person who violates any provision of section 16-117 of this
      chapter shall be guilty of a  violation,  and  upon  conviction  thereof
      shall  be  punished by a fine of not less than two hundred fifty dollars
      nor more than five hundred dollars, or by imprisonment for a term of not

      dollars  nor  more  than  five hundred dollars. Civil penalties shall be
      recovered in a civil action brought in the name of the  commissioner  or
      in a proceeding before the environmental control board.
        c. The commissioner shall have the power to issue notices of violation
      for  violations  of article one hundred fifty-seven of the New York city
      health code and  such  notices  of  violation  shall  be  returnable  as
      provided by law for violations of the New York city health code.
        d. The commissioner of health shall have the power to issue notices of
      violation  for violations of sections 16-130 and 16-131 of this chapter,

      brought  in  the  name  of the commissioner of health or in a proceeding
      before the environmental control board.
    
        e. Nothing contained in this section shall be  construed  to  restrict
      existing  authority of any agency to enforce any other provision of law,
      including but not limited to any provision of the New York  city  health
      code.

        §  16-134  Comprehensive  study  of  commercial solid waste management
      system required. a. 1. "Long haul  transport  vehicle"  shall  mean  any
      motor  vehicle  used  to  remove  solid  waste  or other material from a
      putrescible or non-putrescible solid waste transfer  station  for  final
      disposal, reuse or recycling.
        2.  "Private  carter"  shall  mean  any  individual or business entity
      required to obtain a license from the trade waste commission pursuant to
      subdivision a of section 16-505 of this title.
        3. "Trade waste commission" shall mean the New York city  trade  waste
      commission as established by section 16-502 of this title.
        b.  The  department,  in consultation with the trade waste commission,
      shall enter into  one  or  more  contracts  for  the  performance  of  a
      comprehensive  study  of  the existing commercial solid waste management
      system within the city  of  New  York.  In  performing  the  study,  the
      department  and/or  the  contractor  or  contractors  shall  solicit and
      consider the views of elected officials, the citywide recycling advisory
      board, the borough solid waste advisory boards and the public, including
      residents of affected communities, environmental advocacy organizations,
      transfer station  operators,  private  carters,  business  entities  and
      academicians,  and respond to substantive issues raised. The study shall
      include, but need not be limited to, an analysis of the following:
        1. the effectiveness of procedures employed and the  criteria  applied
      by  the  department  for  the  issuance  and  renewal of permits for the
      operation  of  putrescible  and  non-putrescible  solid  waste  transfer
      stations  in  minimizing  potential  adverse  environmental economic and
      public health impacts on the communities in which such transfer stations
      are located by examining such issues as (i)  the  effectiveness  of  the
      criteria  applied  by  the  department  to the siting of putrescible and
      non-putrescible solid waste transfer stations, including  the  aggregate
      effect  of  the geographic proximity of solid waste transfer stations to
      each other and (ii) the  scope  and  effectiveness  of  the  operational
      restrictions  imposed  upon  putrescible and non-putrescible solid waste
      transfer stations including the hours of operation and  any  performance
      standards established in the zoning resolution of the city of New York;
        2.  the  manner  in  which  all applicable laws, rules and regulations
      relating to the operation of putrescible and non-putrescible solid waste
      transfer stations, private carters and long haul transport vehicles  are
      enforced,  including  who should be responsible for such enforcement and
      the effectiveness of such enforcement in obtaining compliance with  such
      laws,  rules  and  regulations and in minimizing potential environmental
      economic and public health impacts and an analysis of rules relating  to
      routes for transporting material to or from such transfer stations;
        3. the means and potential effects of limiting the number and capacity
      of  putrescible and non-putrescible solid waste transfer stations in the
      city;
        4. the size  and  type  of  vehicles  that  should  be  authorized  to
      transport  solid  waste to or from putrescible and non-putrescible solid
      waste transfer stations and fuel-type requirements for such vehicles;
        5.  whether  putrescible  and  non-putrescible  solid  waste  transfer
      stations  and  city-owned  marine  transfer  stations should receive and
      process both residential and commercial solid waste and the options  for
      transporting  such  solid  waste  to  and  from  such transfer stations,
      including an analysis of potential environmental,  economic  and  public
      health impacts; and
        6.  potential  environmental,  economic  and  public health impacts on
      communities in which large numbers of  privately-owned  putrescible  and
      non-putrescible  solid  waste transfer stations are located such as, but
    
      not limited to, potential impacts related to air quality, water quality,
      odors, traffic congestion and noise.
        c.  The  study required by subdivision b of this section, and a report
      containing a detailed analysis of the findings of such study, as well as
      recommendations based on such analysis and findings, shall be  completed
      no  later  than  eighteen  months  after  registration of the consultant
      contract and at least two months before  the  next  draft  comprehensive
      solid  waste management plan is submitted to the council or the New York
      state department of environmental conservation.  Such  report  shall  be
      submitted  to the mayor and the council immediately upon its completion.
      A preliminary report containing data necessary to perform  the  analyses
      described  in  subdivision  b  of this section shall be submitted by the
      department to the mayor and  the  council  during  or  before  the  last
      quarter of calendar year two thousand one.
        d.  Such study shall be performed and such report shall be prepared in
      a manner designed to assist in the preparation of the next comprehensive
      solid waste management plan for the city of New York required by section
      27-0107 of the New York state environmental conservation law.

      provided in subdivisions c, d and e of this section.
        (b)  A  draft  solid waste management plan for the city which is to be

      for  the  submission of a proposed final solid waste management plan for
      the  city  pursuant  to  article  twenty-seven  of   the   environmental
      conservation  law and the mayor disapproves such law, such proposed plan
      shall not be submitted until either two-thirds of all the members of the
      council have voted whether to repass  such  local  law,  or  the  period
      within  which  such repassing may occur has expired, pursuant to section

      management plan may be submitted pursuant to article twenty-seven of the
      environmental conservation law.
