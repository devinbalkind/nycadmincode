Section 4-101 ::    
        
     
        §  4-101 Acquisition of certain lands; by reversion. In the event that
      any site or plot of ground, transferred to the United  States,  for  the
      erection and maintenance of a light and fog signal at Hunt's Point Park,
      in  the  borough  of the Bronx, should become unnecessary or cease to be
      used for such purposes, such site shall revert to the city, as  if  such
      transfer had not been made.
    
    
    
    
    
    
    

Section 4-102

Section 4-102 ::    
        
     
        §  4-102 Loss of certain lands; by reversion. The lands situate in the
      county of Westchester which were taken by the city, by virtue of the act
      entitled "An act to provide for supplying the city of New York with pure
      and wholesome water" passed May second,  eighteen  hundred  thirty-four,
      shall  be  held  and appropriated by the city for the use and purpose of
      introducing water into the city, and for purposes  necessarily  incident
      thereto,  and  for  no other uses or purposes whatever. In case the city
      should use any of such lands situate in the county  of  Westchester  for
      purposes  other  than  in  this  section permitted, or in case such land
      should not be required for the purpose of  introducing  water  into  the
      city,  such  lands  so improperly used, or not so required, shall become
      vested in the individual from whom such city obtained it,  as  full  and
      perfectly  as  though  such act had never been enacted, upon repaying to
      the city the amount originally paid for the same, after  deducting  from
      such  amount  the  damages sustained by such individual by reason of any
      alteration or work which the city may have made upon such land.

Section 4-104 ::    
        
     
        §  4-104  Title  to  certain public beaches; limitations thereon.   a.
      Title acquired or to be acquired by the city to any uplands,  filled  in
      lands,  lands  under  water,  estates,  rights,  easements, interests or
      privileges for public beaches on the Atlantic ocean from the westernmost
      point of Coney Island to the westerly line of Beach  Second  street,  in
      the  borough of Queens, and on the lower New York bay from the southerly
      line of the United States reservation Fort Wadsworth  to  the  northerly
      line  of  the  United States reservation Miller Field, in the borough of
      Richmond, in each and every case shall be a title in fee  in  trust  for
      the  use  of  the  public  to pass and repass over and along such public
      beach and beaches in the same manner as public  beaches  ordinarily  are
      used.  The  owners  of  property abutting on the inland side of any such
      public beach or beaches shall possess easements of light, air and access
      over, along and across such public beach  or  beaches  to  the  Atlantic
      ocean  and to the lower New York bay, as the case may be, and a frontage
      on  and  access  to  such  public  beaches,  streets,  parks,   avenues,
      boulevards,  promenades,  walks  and boardwalks as may be authorized and
      constructed within the same.
        b. Where such owners have laid out and are maintaining pipes  for  the
      drawing and discharging of sea water under the soil to be acquired for a
      public beach, they shall have the right to maintain such pipes under the
      soil of such public beach or beaches for the purpose only of drawing and
      discharging  sea  water,  the  maintenance of such pipes to be under the
      supervision of the commissioner of parks and  recreation.  Where  owners
      have  not laid and are not maintaining pipes under such soil for drawing
      and discharging of sea water, the board of estimate,  under  such  terms
      and  conditions as to it shall seem proper, may grant to such owners the
      right to lay and maintain pipes for the drawing and discharging  of  sea
      water only under the soil of such public beach or beaches.
    
    
    
    
    
    
    

Section 4-105

Section 4-105 ::    
        
     
        §  4-105  Land  in  private  or  in  closed  or  discontinued streets;
      conveyance to abutting owners or other persons.  a.  Whenever  the  city
      shall  have any right, title or interest in and to the land lying within
      a private street, however  acquired,  or  within  a  street,  closed  or
      discontinued  in whole or in part, the owner of land fronting thereon at
      the time of acquisition of such private street or at the  time  of  such
      closing or discontinuance, or the owner's heirs or assigns, may acquire,
      such  right,  title and interest in and to any parcel or parcels of such
      land lying in front of the lands owned by such person or  persons,  upon
      payment  to the commissioner of finance for the right, title or interest
      to be acquired within such private  street  or  within  such  closed  or
      discontinued  street of such consideration as shall be determined by the
      commissioner of citywide  administrative  services;  provided,  however,
      that,  except  as otherwise provided by law, such consideration shall be
      in an amount not less than the appraised value of such right,  title  or
      interest  as determined by appraisal made within six months prior to the
      authorization of such conveyance.
        b. Such owner or owners or owner's heirs or assigns or the  department
      of citywide administrative services on behalf of such owner or owners or
      owner's  heirs  or assigns shall apply, in writing, to the department of
      city  planning  for  such  conveyance  either  simultaneously  with   an
      application  for  the closing or discontinuance of a street or not later
      than two years after the acquisition of such private street or not later
      than two years after the closing or discontinuance  of  such  closed  or
      discontinued  street. The department of city planning shall process such
      application pursuant to sections  one  hundred  ninety-seven-c  and  one
      hundred  ninety-seven-d  of the charter. The department of city planning
      shall notify or cause to  be  notified  all  other  owners  eligible  to
      purchase  such  right,  title  or interest pursuant to the provisions of
      this section of the filing of such application prior to certifying  that
      such  application is complete. Such notice shall be served by registered
      or certified mail addressed to the last known address of such  owner  or
      owners,  as  the  same  appears  in  the  records  of  the office of the
      commissioner of finance or if there is no name  in  such  records,  such
      notice may be served by ordinary mail addressed to "Owner" at the street
      address  of  the  improvement parcel or property in question. Failure by
      the department to give such notice or cause  such  notice  to  be  given
      shall  not  invalidate any proceedings with respect to such application.
      If the conveyance is approved by the mayor and in the manner  prescribed
      by  any applicable provisions of sections one hundred ninety-seven-c and
      one hundred ninety-seven-d of the charter, the mayor shall cause  to  be
      prepared  and  delivered  to  such  owner  or owners or owner's heirs or
      assigns a conveyance of the right, title and interest of the city in and
      to such parcel or parcels of land in such form as shall be  approved  by
      the  corporation  counsel.  Such  conveyance  shall be delivered to such
      owner or owners or owner's heirs or assigns  upon  payment  of  the  sum
      required by subdivision a hereof to be paid.
        c. The mayor, in conveying such right, title or interest, shall not be
      obliged to convey the right, title or interest of the city in and to the
      land  within  one-half  of  such  private or such closed or discontinued
      street to the owner of the land abutting on such half.  Subject  to  any
      land   use   restrictions  imposed  pursuant  to  sections  one  hundred
      ninety-seven-c or one hundred ninety-seven-d of the charter,  the  mayor
      may  convey all right, title or interest of the city in and to the lands
      in any such private or such closed or discontinued street to  the  owner
      of  the  land  abutting  on  one  side  thereof,  whenever in his or her
      judgment it shall be just and proper, or in the best  interests  of  the
    
      city,  to  do so, or to such abutting owners as require the same to make
      their abutting lands more available for improvements.
        d.  Subject  to the provisions of section three hundred eighty-four of
      the charter, the mayor may at any time sell or otherwise dispose of  the
      right,  title  and  interest  of  the city in and to so much of the land
      lying within such private or such  closed  or  discontinued  street  for
      which  no  application  has  been filed pursuant to this section, to any
      person or persons whomsoever upon such terms and conditions as the mayor
      may deem proper.
        e. The provisions of this section which refer to land or  lands  lying
      within  a private street or within a street closed or discontinued shall
      be deemed to refer to the surface and subsurface of and air  space  over
      such street or any part of the surface or subsurface of or the air space
      over such street.

      with its  water  supply,  upon  such  terms  and  conditions,  for  such
      consideration  and  subject  to  such restrictions as in the judgment of
      such board shall seem proper. No such  grant,  however,  shall  be  made
      unless  such  board  shall first determine that the use or enjoyment for
      such purposes of such lands is not inconsistent with  the  purposes  for
      which  such  lands  were  or may hereafter be acquired. Every such grant
      shall contain covenants restricting the manner and form of such use  and
      enjoyment  in  accordance  with  the  determination  of  the  board, and
      providing for the forfeiture thereof to the city upon breach of  any  of

      by any such grant shall be paid into the real property fund.
        9. Except as limited by subdivision eight of this section, to lease or
      grant,  without  public  letting  in  perpetuity or for shorter periods,
      rights, easements or rights-of-way in, over  or  across  any  city  real
      property  heretofore  or hereafter acquired and used for the purposes of
      impounding, storing or transporting water for municipal water supply  or
      for  the  sanitary  protection  thereof  wheresoever  located, for park,
      parkway, roadway, highway, sewer, railroad or any other public  purpose,
      and  for  elimination  of  highway  railroad crossings at grade for such
      consideration and upon such terms and conditions  and  subject  to  such
      restrictions  as  such  board  may  deem proper. No such lease or grant,
      however, shall be made unless the agency having jurisdiction  over  such
      property shall first determine and certify in writing that such property
      or interest therein so leased or granted will not endanger or injure the
      water  supply structures or other property of the city or interfere with
      the use and operation thereof for water supply  or  sanitary  protection
      purposes.  Every such lease or grant shall contain covenants restricting
      the use of such property or interest  therein  in  accordance  with  the
      determination  of  such  board,  and providing for the forfeiture to the
      city of such property or  interest  therein  upon  breach  of  any  such
      covenants.
        10.  To  exchange  and convey lands under water in creeks, tributaries
      thereto, ditches, ponds and bays no longer  required  by  the  city  for
    
      public  purposes.  In  exchange for lands conveyed the mayor may acquire
      lands of private owners, necessary for sewer drainage canals, within the
      lines of any sewer  drainage  canal  as  laid  out,  and  the  mayor  is
      authorized  to take deeds and conveyances. Such exchange, however, shall
      not be made to or with any owner or owners whose upland does  not  abut,
      bound  or  adjoin  the lands under water to be exchanged, nor shall such
      board convey such lands  under  water  until  the  agency  having  under
      control  or  supervision  such  lands  under  water,  shall  have  first
      certified to the board that the lands  to  be  conveyed  are  no  longer
      necessary or required for public purposes. In the exchange of such lands
      all  right,  title  and  interest  of  private owners in that portion of
      creeks, tributaries thereto,  ditches,  ponds  and  bays  not  abutting,
      bounding  or  adjoining  lands under water so exchanged, shall be deeded
      and delivered to the city, and the board by resolution and the mayor  by
      order  shall  authorize  such  exchange.  The corporation counsel by the
      direction of the board  and  the  mayor,  shall  thereupon  prepare  and
      certify  the  forms  of all legal instruments and deeds necessary on the
      part of the city to effect such exchange in law. The board and the mayor
      shall designate and  authorize  the  proper  official  or  officials  to
      execute  and deliver all legal instruments and deeds necessary to effect
      such exchange. The land so acquired by the exchange shall be assigned to
      the agency requiring the  use  of  the  same,  upon  proper  application
      therefor.
