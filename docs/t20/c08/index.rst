Section 20-913 ::    
        
     
        20-913 Right to sick time; accrual. a. All employees have the right to
      sick time pursuant to this chapter.
        1.  All  employers  that  employ  fifteen  or  more  employees and all
      employers of one or more domestic workers shall provide paid  sick  time
      to their employees in accordance with the provisions of this chapter and
      the  schedule set forth in section 7 of the local law which enacted this
      section.
        2. All employees not entitled to  paid  sick  time  pursuant  to  this
      chapter  shall  be  entitled  to unpaid sick time in accordance with the
      provisions of this chapter and the schedule set forth in  section  7  of
      the local law which enacted this section.
        3.  All  employers  that employ fifteen to nineteen employees, and all
      employers of one or more domestic workers,  shall  provide  unpaid  sick
      time  in accordance with the provisions of this chapter and the schedule
      set forth in section 7 of the  local  law  which  enacted  this  section
      during  any  period  in  which,  pursuant  to  the schedule set forth in
      section 7 of the local law which enacted this  section,  such  employers
      are  not  required  to  provide paid sick time but employers that employ
      twenty or more employees are required to provide paid sick time.
        b. All employers shall provide a minimum of one hour of sick time  for
      every  thirty  hours worked by an employee, other than a domestic worker
      who shall accrue sick time pursuant to paragraph 2 of subdivision  d  of
      this  section.  Employers  shall  not  be required under this chapter to
      provide more than forty hours of sick time for an employee in a calendar
      year. For purposes of this subdivision, any paid days of rest to which a
      domestic worker is entitled pursuant to section 161(1) of the labor  law
      shall  count  toward  such forty hours. Nothing in this chapter shall be
      construed to discourage  or  prohibit  an  employer  from  allowing  the
      accrual  of sick time at a faster rate or use of sick time at an earlier
      date than this chapter requires.
        c. An employer required to provide paid sick  time  pursuant  to  this
      chapter who provides an employee with an amount of paid leave, including
      paid  time  off,  paid vacation, paid personal days or paid days of rest
      required to be compensated pursuant to section 161(1) of the labor  law,
      sufficient  to meet the requirements of this section and who allows such
      paid leave to  be  used  for  the  same  purposes  and  under  the  same
      conditions  as  sick  time  required  pursuant  to  this chapter, is not
      required to provide additional paid sick time for such employee  whether
      or not such employee chooses to use such leave for the purposes included
      in subdivision a of section 20-914 of this chapter. An employer required
      to  provide  unpaid  sick  time pursuant to this chapter who provides an
      employee with an amount of unpaid or paid  leave,  including  unpaid  or
      paid time off, unpaid or paid vacation, or unpaid or paid personal days,
      sufficient  to meet the requirements of this section and who allows such
      leave to be used for the same purposes and under the same conditions  as
      sick  time required pursuant to this chapter, is not required to provide
      additional unpaid sick time  for  such  employee  whether  or  not  such
      employee  chooses  to  use  such  leave  for  the  purposes set forth in
      subdivision a of section 20-914 of this chapter.
        d. 1. For an employee other than  a  domestic  worker,  sick  time  as
      provided  pursuant  to  this  chapter  shall  begin  to  accrue  at  the
      commencement of employment or on the effective date of this  local  law,
      whichever  is  later,  and  an employee shall be entitled to begin using
      sick  time  on  the  one  hundred  twentieth  calendar   day   following
      commencement  of  his  or her employment or on the one hundred twentieth
      calendar day following the effective date of this local  law,  whichever
      is  later. After the one hundred twentieth calendar day of employment or
      after the one hundred twentieth calendar  day  following  the  effective
    
      date  of  this local law, whichever is later, such employee may use sick
      time as it is accrued.
        2.  In  addition  to  the paid day or days of rest to which a domestic
      worker is entitled pursuant to section 161(1) of  the  labor  law,  such
      domestic  worker shall also be entitled to two days of paid sick time as
      of the date that such domestic worker is entitled to such  paid  day  or
      days  of rest and annually thereafter, provided that notwithstanding any
      provision of this chapter to the contrary, such two days  of  paid  sick
      time  shall  be calculated in the same manner as the paid day or days of
      rest are calculated pursuant to the provisions of section 161(1) of  the
      labor law.
        e.  Employees  who are not covered by the overtime requirements of New
      York state law or regulations, including the wage orders promulgated  by
      the New York commissioner of labor pursuant to article 19 or 19-A of the
      labor  law,  shall  be assumed to work forty hours in each work week for
      purposes of sick time accrual unless their regular  work  week  is  less
      than  forty  hours,  in  which  case  sick  time accrues based upon that
      regular work week.
        f. The provisions of this chapter do  not  apply  to  (i)  work  study
      programs  under  42  U.S.C.  section  2753, (ii) employees for the hours
      worked and compensated by or through qualified scholarships  as  defined
      in  26 U.S.C. section 117, (iii) independent contractors who do not meet
      the definition of employee under section 190(2) of the  labor  law,  and
      (iv) hourly professional employees.
        g.  Employees  shall  determine how much earned sick time they need to
      use, provided that employers may set a reasonable minimum increment  for
      the use of sick time not to exceed four hours per day.
        h.  Except for domestic workers, unused sick time as provided pursuant
      to this chapter shall be carried over to the  following  calendar  year;
      provided that no employer shall be required to (i) allow the use of more
      than  forty  hours  of  sick  time in a calendar year or (ii) carry over
      unused paid sick time if the employee is paid for any unused  sick  time
      at  the  end  of the calendar year in which such time is accrued and the
      employer provides the employee with an amount of  paid  sick  time  that
      meets  or exceeds the requirements of this chapter for such employee for
      the immediately subsequent  calendar  year  on  the  first  day  of  the
      immediately subsequent calendar year.
        i.  Nothing  in this chapter shall be construed as requiring financial
      or other  reimbursement  to  an  employee  from  an  employer  upon  the
      employee's  termination,  resignation,  retirement,  or other separation
      from employment for accrued sick time that has not been used.
        j. If an employee is transferred to a  separate  division,  entity  or
      location  in  the  city  of  New  York, but remains employed by the same
      employer, such employee is entitled to all  sick  time  accrued  at  the
      prior  division, entity or location and is entitled to retain or use all
      sick time as provided pursuant to the provisions of this  chapter.  When
      there is a separation from employment and the employee is rehired within
      six  months  of separation by the same employer, previously accrued sick
      time that was not used shall be reinstated and such  employee  shall  be
      entitled  to  use such accrued sick time at any time after such employee
      is rehired, provided that no employer shall  be  required  to  reinstate
      such  sick  time  to the extent the employee was paid for unused accrued
      sick time prior to separation and the employee agreed to accept such pay
      for such unused sick time.

      condition  or  need for medical diagnosis, care or treatment of a mental
      or physical illness, injury or health condition or need  for  preventive
      medical care; or
        2.  care  of  a  family  member  who  needs medical diagnosis, care or
      treatment of a mental or physical illness, injury or health condition or
      who needs preventive medical care; or
        3. closure of such employee's place of business by order of  a  public

      care for a child whose school or childcare provider has been  closed  by
      order of a public official due to a public health emergency.
        b.  An  employer may require reasonable notice of the need to use sick
      time. Where such need is foreseeable, an employer may require reasonable
      advance notice of the intention to use such sick  time,  not  to  exceed
      seven days prior to the date such sick time is to begin. Where such need
      is  not  foreseeable,  an  employer  may  require an employee to provide
      notice of the need for the use of sick time as soon as practicable.
        c. For an absence  of  more  than  three  consecutive  work  days,  an
      employer  may require reasonable documentation that the use of sick time
      was authorized by subdivision a of this  section.  For  sick  time  used
      pursuant  to  paragraphs  1  and  2  of  subdivision  a of this section,
      documentation signed by a licensed health care provider  indicating  the
      need  for  the  amount of sick time taken shall be considered reasonable

      specify  the  nature of the employee's or the employee's family member's
      injury, illness or condition, except as required by law.
        d. Nothing herein shall prevent an employer from requiring an employee
      to provide written confirmation that an employee used sick time pursuant
      to this section.
        e. An employer shall not require an employee, as a condition of taking
      sick time, to search for or find a replacement worker to cover the hours
      during which such employee is utilizing sick time.
        f. Nothing in this chapter shall be construed to prohibit an  employer
      from  taking  disciplinary  action,  up  to  and  including termination,
      against a worker who uses sick time provided pursuant  to  this  chapter
      for purposes other than those described in this section.

      subdivision  a  of  section  20-914  of this chapter may work additional
      hours during the immediately preceding seven days  if  the  absence  was
      foreseeable  or  within  the immediately subsequent seven days from that
      absence without using sick time to make up for the  original  hours  for
      which  such  employee was absent, provided that an adjunct professor who
      is an employee at  an  institute  of  higher  education  may  work  such
      additional hours at any time during the academic term. An employer shall

      original hours for which such employee was absent or to  search  for  or
      find a replacement employee to cover the hours during which the employee
      is  absent  pursuant  to this section. If such employee works additional
      hours, and such hours are fewer than the number of hours  such  employee
      was  originally  scheduled  to work, then such employee shall be able to
      use sick time provided pursuant to  this  chapter  for  the  difference.
      Should  the  employee  work  additional hours, the employer shall comply
