        b. In addition to any sign or placard required pursuant to subdivision
      five  of  section  one hundred ninety-two of the agriculture and markets
      law, there shall be a sign, poster or placard clearly visible to drivers

      than  the total selling price for purchases made with credit card, debit
      card or other form of non-cash payment, such  sign,  poster  or  placard
      shall state the total selling price for each type of accepted payment.
        c.  All numbers referring to price shall be the same height, width and
      thickness. Identification of the gasoline or diesel motor  fuel  offered

      selling price from the total credit card, debit card or  other  form  of
      non-cash  payment selling price shall be in letters and numbers not less
      than one-half  of  the  height,  width  and  thickness  of  the  numbers
      referring  to  price.  Letters  and  numbers  shall  be black on a white
      background.
        d. Price per gallon indicator. Except as otherwise provided in article
      sixteen of the agriculture and markets law or in any rule or regulations
      promulgated thereunder, every gasoline or diesel motor  fuel  dispensing
      device  shall  be  equipped  with a price per gallon indicator and shall
      have such indicator correspond with the total price per  gallon  on  the
      sign,  poster  or  placard required to be posted pursuant to subdivision
      five of section one hundred ninety-two of such law or subdivision  b  of
      this section.
    
        e.  Total  price  indicator.  Every  gasoline  or  diesel  motor  fuel
      dispensing device shall be equipped with a total delivery indicator, and
      such indicator shall record the correct  total  price  computed  on  the
      basis of posted price per gallon and number of gallons delivered.
        f.  Notwithstanding  the  foregoing,  subdivisions  a, b and c of this
      section shall not apply to the posting of information  and  labeling  of
      dispensing  devices  with  respect  to  the lead content of gasoline for
      motor vehicles, which shall be governed by the provisions of subdivision
      d and e of  section  20-673.1  of  this  subchapter  and  any  rules  or
      regulations  promulgated thereunder, and subdivisions a, b and c of this

      purchaser-consumer gasoline contained in the storage tank which supplied
      the pump from which the gasoline was sold, dispensed or offered for sale

      the   violation   was   not   caused   by  such  retailer  or  wholesale
      purchaser-consumer or his or her employee or agent.
        (2) In any case in which a retailer  or  wholesale  purchaser-consumer

      if any, and any refiner would be deemed in violation under paragraph one
      of subdivision f of this section, the refiner shall  not  be  deemed  in
      violation if he or she can demonstrate:
        (a)  that  the  violation was not caused by such refiner or his or her
      employee or agent, and
        (b) that the violation was caused by an act in violation of  any  law,
      other  than  the  provisions  of  this  section,  or an act of sabotage,
      vandalism, or deliberate commingling of leaded  and  unleaded  gasoline,
      whether or not such acts are violations of law in the jurisdiction where
      the violation of the requirements of this section occurred, or
        (c)  that  the  violation  was caused by the action of a reseller or a
      retailer supplied by  such  reseller,  in  violation  of  a  contractual
      undertaking  imposed by the refiner on such reseller designed to prevent
      such action, and despite reasonable efforts by  the  refiner  to  insure
      compliance  with such contractual obligation, such as periodic sampling,
      or
        (d) that the violation was caused by the action of a retailer  who  is
      supplied  directly by the refiner and not by a reseller, in violation of
      a contractual undertaking  imposed  by  the  refiner  on  such  retailer
      designed  to  prevent such action, and despite reasonable efforts by the
      refiner to insure compliance with such contractual obligation,  such  as
      periodic sampling, or
    
        (e)  that  the  violation  was  caused  by the action of a distributor
      subject to a contract with the refiner for  transportation  of  gasoline
      from    a   terminal   to   a   distributor,   retailer   or   wholesale
      purchaser-consumer, in violation of a contractual undertaking imposed by
      the  refiner  on  such  distributor designed to prevent such action, and
      despite reasonable efforts by the refiner to insure compliance with such
      contractual obligation, such as periodic sampling, or
        (f) that the violation was caused by a distributor (such as  a  common
      carrier)  not  subject to a contract with the refiner but engaged by him
      or her for transportation of gasoline from a terminal to a  distributor,
      retailer  or wholesale purchaser-consumer, despite reasonable efforts by
      the refiner to prevent such action, such as specification or  inspection
      of equipment, or
        (g)  that  the  violation  occurred  at a wholesale purchaser-consumer
      facility; provided, however, that if such  wholesale  purchaser-consumer
      was  supplied  by  a  reseller,  the  refiner  must demonstrate that the
      violation could not have been prevented by  such  reseller's  compliance
      with  a  contractual undertaking imposed by the refiner on such reseller
      as provided in subparagraph c of this paragraph.
        (h) For purposes of subparagraphs (b) through (f) of  this  paragraph,
      the  term  "was  caused"  means  that  the  refiner  must demonstrate by
      reasonably specific showings by direct or circumstantial  evidence  that
      the violation was caused or must have been caused by another.
        (3)  In  any  case in which a retailer or wholesale purchaser-consumer
      would be in violation of subdivision c of this section, and  a  reseller
      and  any  refiner  would  be  deemed in violation under paragraph one of
      subdivision f of this section, the  reseller  shall  not  be  deemed  in
      violation if he or she can demonstrate that the violation was not caused
      by such reseller or his or her employee or agent.
        (4)  In  any  case in which a retailer or wholesale purchaser-consumer
      would be in  violation  of  subdivision  c  of  this  section,  and  any
      distributor  would  be  deemed  in  violation  under  paragraph  two  of
      subdivision f of this section, the distributor will  not  be  deemed  in
      violation if he or she can demonstrate that the violation was not caused
      by such distributor or his or her employee or agent.

      enforcement of such final order.
        f. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the commissioner shall cause  to  be
      published  in  the  City  Record  once  each month the name and business
      location of any person, firm or corporation that has been found to  have
