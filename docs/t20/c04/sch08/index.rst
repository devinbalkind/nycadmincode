Subchapter 8 - PERISHABLE FOODS
===============================

Section 20-684
--------------

Section 20-684 ::    
        
     
        §  20-684  Legislative intent. The council finds that consumers cannot
      be certain that food offered for sale is fresh or that  it  will  remain
      fresh for a reasonable period of time after it is purchased. The council
      particularly  recognizes  consumer  concern  with the freshness of foods
      including, but not limited to,  meat,  poultry,  fish,  dairy  products,
      eggs,  fruit, vegetables and baked goods. The council further finds that
      the food industry's practice of controlling food freshness through coded
      dates has proven inadequate for protection of the  public.  The  council
      has  concluded  that  a  mandatory  system  of  clear and legible dating
      accompanied by a statement of recommended conditions of storage  is  the
      best way to assure consumers of the freshness of the foods that they buy
      in stores.

      sale any perishable food designated by the  commissioner  in  accordance
      with section 20-686 hereof unless there is stamped, printed or otherwise
      plainly  and conspicuously marked on the top cover or principal panel of
      its container or any label affixed  thereto  the  statements  indicating
      recommended  conditions  and methods of storage, and the fact that it is
      not to be sold after a clearly specified date for human  consumption  as
      food.
    
    
    
    
    
    
    

Section 20-686

Section 20-686 ::    
        
     
        §  20-686  Regulations.  The commissioner shall promulgate regulations
      designating those perishable foods which shall come within the scope  of
      section  20-685  of this subchapter wherever the commissioner shall find
      that because of the nature of the commodity, the mode  of  packaging  or
      other  consideration,  such  information  about  the  commodity shall be
      necessary and proper to provide adequate information to the consumer  as
      to the perishable nature of such commodity and conditions of storage.

      necessary and proper.
