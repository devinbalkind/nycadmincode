      section 20-362 of this code, be permitted to operate for six months on a
      probationary  license.  At the end of such six month period, the license

      licensee,  its  officers, principals, directors, agents or employees or,

      that  would  constitute grounds for denying the issuance or renewal of a
      license pursuant to section 20-361 of this code. Upon a finding of  such
      conduct  the  probationary  license  shall  be  revoked and shall not be
      reissued for a period of one year.
