      type and make of the device,  all  service  work  performed,  all  parts
      supplied,  the  date  or  dates  thereof,  and  all charges made and the

      customer  and  the other shall be retained by the dealer for a period of
      at least three years from the date of such delivery.
        b. Upon request by telephone, in person or in writing, the dealer must
      provide information as to price and anticipated delivery  date  for  the
      rental,  sale,  repair  or  service  of  any  product  covered  by  this
      subchapter.
        c. The dealer must give a prospective customer a written estimate  for
      labor and parts required for a specific job if he or she intends to take
      the  job.  No  charge  for work performed or parts supplied in excess of
      twenty percent over written estimate shall be made unless the consent of
      the customer was  obtained  as  described  in  section  20-425  of  this
      subchapter  before  such  work  was  done,  parts  supplied  or services
      rendered.
        d. The dealer shall return all replaced parts to the customer,  except
      such  parts  as  may be exempted from this requirement by regulations of
      the commissioner and except such parts as the  service  dealer  requires
      for   return  to  the  manufacturer  or  distributor  under  a  warranty
      arrangement.
        e. A dealer shall not make the remuneration,  salary,  wage  or  other
      compensation  of  any  partner,  staff member, or employee contingent or
      dependent upon, or  in  any  manner  determined  by  the  value,  price,
      quantity  or  type  of  parts  replaced,  upon any apparatus serviced or
      repaired by any person required to be licensed by this subchapter.
        f. Every dealer shall maintain any additional records required  to  be
      kept  by  regulations  adopted by the commissioner for a period of three
      years. Such records must be available for inspection by the commissioner
      or other law enforcement officials.
        g. No dealer shall charge a total price, excluding tax, which is  more
      than twenty percent above the written estimate.

      goods, together with a final bill, as defined  above,  on  the  promised
      completion  date,  unless  the consumer is notified of the delay and the
      anticipated completion date.  If  complete  repair  is  delayed  for  an
      unreasonable  period  of  time  the consumer shall have the right to the
      immediate return of the property.

      designee  may  revoke  or  suspend  any  license  required  under   this
      subchapter or deny renewal of one upon a determination that a licensee:
        a.  Has  been convicted of a crime or offense which in the judgment of

      unfit  to  properly  discharge  his  or  her responsibilities under this
      subchapter.
        b. Has practiced fraud or misrepresentation  upon  a  customer  or  in
      establishing  his  or  her  qualifications  for  a  license  under  this

      persuade or induce a customer to authorize the sale, repair, maintenance
      or servicing of any product covered by this subchapter.
        d.  Has  failed to perform work or service in accordance with accepted
      trade standards.
