Section 20-371 ::    
        
     
        §  20-371  Licensing of sight-seeing buses, horse drawn cabs and horse
      drawn  cab  drivers.  Legislative  findings.  The  legislative  findings
      heretofore  made  in  relation to the business of sight-seeing buses and
      horse drawn cabs in the city of New York and  set  forth  in  local  law
      number  ten  of  nineteen  hundred sixty-four continue to be valid; such
      businesses are vested with a public interest and  their  regulation  and
      control  continue  to  be  necessary and essential in order to cope with
      certain evils and hazards which existed in the absence  of  governmental
      supervision.   The  supervision  formerly  was  reposed  in  the  police
      commissioner, but recent experience and study indicate that jurisdiction
      over such businesses should be transferred to the  commissioner.  It  is
      further  found  that  the present number of horse drawn cabs licensed in
      the city of New York is adequate to meet the public need and demand  and
      should  be  preserved,  unless  the  commissioner  finds that additional
      licenses are necessary and advisable.

Section 20-373 ::    
        
     
        §  20-373  License  required;  fee;  term.  a. It shall be unlawful to
      operate or permit another to operate for  hire  a  sight-seeing  bus  or
      horse-drawn  cab  within  the  city  unless  the  owner shall have first
      obtained a license therefor from the commissioner. An  applicant  for  a
      horse-drawn cab license shall be at least eighteen years of age.
        b.  Fees.  The  original and renewal license fee for each sight-seeing

        c. The commissioner shall not renew any horse-drawn cab license in the

      the commissioner may renew such license.
        d. The commissioner may refuse to renew any horse drawn cab license in

      subchapter as illustrated by repeated violations of such provisions.
    
    
    
    
    
    
    

Section 20-374
--------------

Section 20-374 ::    
        
     
        §  20-374  Granting and transferring of licenses. a. Any person, firm,
      partnership,  corporation  or  association,  owning   or   operating   a
      sight-seeing  bus, or buses, or horse-drawn cab, or cabs engaging in the
      business of transporting passengers in, about, over and upon any of  the
      streets,  avenues, bridges, highways, boulevards or public places within
      the limits of the city of New York, shall be issued a license  for  each
      bus  or  cab  so  operating,  provided,  however  any such person, firm,
      partnership,  corporation  or  association   owning   or   operating   a
      sight-seeing  bus  or  buses,  shall  first  have  obtained a license or
      licenses,  as  he  or  she  shall  be  entitled  to  receive  from   the
      commissioner  of  motor  vehicles  of  the state of New York as made and
      provided by law.
        b. It shall be unlawful for a  license,  after  being  issued  by  the
      commissioner,  to  be  transferred  to  any  person,  firm, partnership,
      corporation  or  association  for  any  cause  whatsoever,  except  that
      licenses  for  horse-drawn  cabs may be transferred with the approval of
      the  commissioner.  Upon  voluntary  sale  or  transfer  of  a  licensed
      horse-drawn  cab  by  the  holder  of  a  license  or  his  or her legal
      representative, the licensee shall immediately notify  the  commissioner
      of  his  or  her  intention  to  replace  such horse-drawn cab, or shall
      surrender his or her license. If the license is surrendered, the  vendee
      or transferee may make application to the commissioner for the licensing
      of  the horse-drawn cab so purchased. A new license shall then be issued
      by the commissioner in place of the license so surrendered, provided the
      applicant has demonstrated to the satisfaction of the commissioner  that
      he  or  she  is  qualified  to  assume  the  duties and obligations of a
      horse-drawn cab license.
        c.  The  commissioner  shall  issue  additional  licenses  only  after
      conducting a public hearing to determine whether the public convenience,
      welfare  and  necessity  require the operation of additional horse-drawn
      cabs. The public hearing shall be called upon his or her own  motion  or
      upon  written  request  by  any applicant. Notice of such public hearing
      shall be published in the City Record once a week  for  two  consecutive
      weeks  and shall be mailed to all current licensees. If the commissioner
      shall determine that  additional  horse-drawn  cabs  are  necessary  and
      advisable,  he  or  she  shall  certify the number of new licenses to be
      granted. Not more than one such public hearing shall be held during  any
      calendar year and the commissioner may refuse to consider any request if
      it  appears  that  a recent public hearing has adequately considered the
      question. In making his or her  determination,  the  commissioner  shall
      consider among other things, the income of the driver, the income of the
      owner,  the effect upon traffic, and the public demand. The new licenses
      which are granted shall be allocated to the then existent  licensees  in
      the  ratio  of  the number of licenses held by the licensee to the total
      number of licenses issued and in effect. If a licensee does  not  accept
      his  or  her  allotted  number  within sixty days, his or her additional
      licenses shall be allocated in  the  same  manner  among  the  remaining
      licensees.   If   the   number  of  additional  licenses  authorized  is
      insufficient to permit such  allocation,  then  the  distribution  among
      those  licensees  entitled to the smallest number of additional licenses
      shall be made so that priority shall be given to  those  who  have  been
      uninterruptedly licensed for the longest period. New applicants for such
      additional  licenses shall be considered only when the present licensees
      refuse to accept their allocation of licenses  in  the  manner  provided
      above.  The  distribution  of such additional licenses to new applicants
      shall be in the order of their filing, provided however  that  each  new
      applicant shall not be entitled to more than one such additional license
    
      until  each  new applicant who has filed at the time of distribution and
      who is otherwise eligible has received one license.
    
    
    
    
    
    
    

Section 20-375
--------------

Section 20-375 ::    
        
     
        §  20-375  License  plate.  Upon  the  payment  of the license fee the
      commissioner shall issue a license to the owner of the  sightseeing  bus
      or  horse drawn cab together with a license plate to be securely affixed
      to a conspicuous and indispensable  part  of  such  sightseeing  bus  or
      securely  and conspicuously affixed to the rear axle of such horse drawn
      cab, on which shall be clearly set forth  the  license  number  of  such
      sightseeing  bus  or  horse  drawn  cab. The license plate issued to the
      licensee may, in the discretion of the commissioner, be  a  plate  of  a
      permanent   nature   with  a  replaceable  date  tag  attached  thereto,
      indicating the expiration date of the plate during each license year and
      the issuance of such a plate with such date tag to a  person  possessing
      such  a plate, shall be deemed issuance of a license plate. Such license
      plate and the replaceable date tag to be issued from year to year to  be
      attached  thereto, shall be of such material, form, design and dimension
      and set forth such distinguishing number or other  identification  marks
      as  the  commissioner  shall prescribe. The commissioner upon renewal of
      the license hereunder, may continue the use of the license plate for  as
      many  additional license years as he or she in his or her discretion may
      determine, in which event he or she  shall  issue  and  deliver  to  the
      licensee  a  replaceable date tag as evidence of renewal of the license,
      which shall be attached or affixed in such  manner  as  he  or  she  may
      prescribe  by  rule.  The failure to affix or display such date tag in a
      manner prescribed by the commissioner shall constitute  a  violation  of
      this section. In the event of the loss, mutilation or destruction of any
      license  plate  or  date  tag  issued hereunder, the owner may file such
      statement and proof of facts as the commissioner shall require,  with  a
      fee  of twenty-five dollars, at the department, and the department shall
      issue a duplicate or substitute license plate or date tag.

      licensed as a sight-seeing bus only after it shall  have  been  examined
      and  inspected to determine that it complies with this section, and that
      it also (1) complies with  all  the  requirements  of  the  vehicle  and
      traffic  law  of  the  state  of  New  York, and (2) is certified by the

      applicable  to  the date on which a sight-seeing bus license application
      for such bus is submitted to the commissioner,  has  been  installed  in
      such vehicle.
        (2)  The  commissioner shall not renew the license of any sight-seeing
      bus that was licensed as of the date of the introduction  of  the  local
      law  which  added  this amendment and that when originally manufactured,

      unless an engine covered by a certificate of conformity for a model year
      no earlier than the model year applicable to the date on which the local
      law  which  added  this  amendment was introduced, has been installed in
      such bus.

      inspections  to  the  department  of  environmental  protection; and (3)

Section 20-381 ::    
        
     
        § 20-381 Horse drawn cab driver's license. a. It shall be unlawful for
      any person to operate a horse drawn cab within the city without having a
      valid horse drawn cab driver's license from the commissioner.
        b.  The  biennial  fee  for each such horse drawn cab driver's license
      shall be thirty dollars.
        c. The commissioner shall investigate each applicant as  to  character
      and fitness before such license shall be issued.
        d.  A  horse drawn cab driver's license shall not be issued or renewed
      unless the applicant  therefor  has  submitted  to  the  commissioner  a
      certificate  issued  by  the  commissioner of health pursuant to section
      17-334.1 of the code.
        e. It shall be unlawful for any owner of a horse drawn cab  to  permit
      such  horse  drawn cab to be operated by a person who does not possess a
      current valid driver's license issued pursuant to this section.  In  any
      prosecution of an owner for a violation of this section, it shall not be
      necessary  to  prove  that  the owner knew or should have known that the
      driver was unlicensed, and there shall be a rebuttable presumption  that
      such cab was operated with the permission of the owner.
        f.  An  applicant  who  has  not  previously held a license under this
      section shall be issued a probationary license upon approval of  his  or
      her application. A holder of a probationary license may ride alongside a
      licensed  driver at any time. A probationary license shall be valid from
      the date of issuance until six months after the date of issuance and may
      be revoked for any violation of the rules and regulations pertaining  to
      rental horses and horse drawn cabs. Until he or she accrues eighty hours
      time  spent  operating  a  horse  drawn  cab, a holder of a probationary
      license shall only be permitted to operate a horse drawn cab at  staging
      areas  immediately  adjacent  to  Central  Park and on roadways or paths
      wholly within a New York City park.  Following  the  accrual  of  eighty
      hours  of  time  spent  operating  a  horse  drawn  cab,  a  holder of a
      probationary license shall be permitted to operate a horse drawn cab  to
      or  from  a  stable  at  any time. For the purposes of this subsection a
      person shall be considered to be operating a horse drawn cab  if  he  or
      she  is  holding  the reins of a horse attached to a horse drawn cab and
      directing such horse's movements while the cab  is  in  motion.  At  the
      conclusion  of  six  months, if the probationary licensee has accrued no
      violations under subchapter 3  of  title  17  or  this  subchapter,  the
      licensee  shall  be  issued a horse drawn cab driver's license under the
      terms of this subchapter.
