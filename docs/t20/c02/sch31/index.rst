        b.  "Evidence  vehicle"  shall  mean any vehicle which is suspected of
      having been used as a means of committing a crime or employed in aid  or

Section 20-496 ::    
        
     
        §  20-496 License required. a. Except as otherwise provided in section
      20-524 of this subchapter, no person  shall  engage  in  towing  without
      having first obtained a license for such towing business issued pursuant
      to  section 20-498 of this subchapter. Such license shall be referred to
      as a license to engage in towing.  No  person  shall  engage  in  towing
      without  having  obtained  a  license  plate  for  each tow truck issued
      pursuant to section 20-503 of this subchapter.
        b. Except as otherwise provided in section 20-524 of this  subchapter,
      no  person shall drive or otherwise operate a tow truck or assist in any
      activity for which a license is required under  this  subchapter  unless
      such  person  shall  have  first obtained a tow truck operator's license
      issued pursuant to section 20-498 of this chapter.
        c. No person who is required to obtain a license under  subdivision  a
      of this section shall permit or authorize the driving or other operation
      of  a  tow  truck  by a person who does not possess a current, valid tow
      truck operator's license or whose tow truck operator's license has  been
      suspended   or  revoked  where  such  license  is  required  under  this
      subchapter. In any prosecution for violation  of  this  subdivision,  it
      shall  not  be  necessary  to prove that such person knew or should have
      known that the operator was unlicensed, and there shall be a  rebuttable
      presumption  that  such  tow truck was driven or otherwise operated with
      the permission or authorization of such person. In any such prosecution,
      it shall be an affirmative defense that prior to being  cited  for  such
      violation,  such  person  registered  such  tow  truck operator with the
      department in accordance with the procedures prescribed by rule  of  the
      commissioner and the department did not send notification to such person
      that  such  tow  truck  operator  lacked  a  current,  valid  tow  truck
      operator's license or that such operator's license had been suspended or
      revoked.

      any  license  required  under this subchapter or for any renewal thereof
      shall be made to the commissioner in such form and manner as he  or  she
      shall  prescribe  by regulation. An applicant for any such license shall
      be fingerprinted by the department for the purpose of securing  criminal
      history  records  from  the state division of criminal justice services.
      The applicant shall pay a  processing  fee  as  required  by  the  state
      division  of  criminal  justice  services. Where the applicant is a sole
      proprietorship, fingerprints shall be taken of the owner thereof.  Where
      the  applicant  is  a  partnership,  fingerprints  shall be taken of the
      general  partners  thereof.  Where  the  applicant  is  a   corporation,
      fingerprints  shall  be taken of the officers, principals, directors and
      stockholders owning more than ten percent of the  outstanding  stock  of
      the corporation. Any person required to be fingerprinted hereunder shall
      furnish  to  the  department  three current passport size photographs of
      such person. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the  commissioner  need  not
      require  applicants  for  licenses  required under this subchapter to be
      fingerprinted if criminal history records concerning such applicants are
      not available from the state division of criminal justice services.
        b. There shall be a biennial fee for a license to engage in towing and
      for each tow truck in excess of one operated pursuant to  such  license.
      Such  fee for a license to engage in towing shall be six hundred dollars
      and such fee for each tow truck in excess of one shall  be  six  hundred
      dollars.  There  shall  be  a  biennial  fee  for a tow truck operator's
      license. The fee for such tow truck operator's license shall  be  twenty
      dollars.  In  the  event  of  the loss, mutilation or destruction of any
      license issued hereunder, the licensee may file such statement and proof
      of facts as the commissioner  shall  require,  with  a  fee  of  fifteen
      dollars per license, at the department, and the department shall issue a
      duplicate or substitute license.
        c.  All  licenses  issued to a business pursuant to this subchapter to
      engage in  towing  and  all  license  plates  issued  pursuant  to  this
      subchapter  for  tow  trucks  shall  expire  on April thirtieth, in even
      numbered years, and all licenses issued pursuant to this  subchapter  to
      tow  truck  drivers  to  operate  tow  trucks  shall  expire  on October
      thirty-first, in even years, unless sooner suspended or revoked.
    
    
    
    
    
    
    

Section 20-498

        §  20-498  Issuance of license. a. A license to engage in towing shall
      be issued only where an applicant meets all the requirements of sections
      20-499,  20-500,  20-501,  20-502,  any  criteria  in  addition  thereto
      established  by  the  commissioner  by  regulation  as  he  or she deems
      necessary to effectuate the purposes of this  subchapter  and  satisfies
      the commissioner that such applicant possesses good moral character.
        b.  A  license  to  operate  a tow truck shall be issued only where an
      applicant is at least eighteen years of age, satisfies the  commissioner
      that  he  or  she  is capable of safely operating a tow truck, meets any
      additional criteria established by the commissioner by regulation as  he
      or she deems necessary to effectuate the purposes of this subchapter and
      satisfies  the  commissioner  that  such  applicant possesses good moral
      character. For purposes of determining whether the applicant is  capable
      of  safely  operating  a  tow  truck,  the  commissioner  may  take into
      consideration any violation by such applicant of the vehicle and traffic
      law or any other applicable law pertaining to vehicle operation.
        c. The commissioner may refuse to issue to an  applicant  any  license
      required under this subchapter based upon a determination made after due
      notice  and  opportunity  to be heard that such applicant has engaged in
      conduct which  would  constitute  a  basis  for  license  suspension  or
      revocation as set forth in this subchapter.
    
    
    
    
    
    
    

Section 20-499

Section 20-499 ::    
        
     
        §  20-499  Bond.  a.  As  a  condition of the issuance of a license to
      engage in towing, each applicant shall furnish  to  the  commissioner  a
      surety  bond in the sum of five thousand dollars, payable to the city of
      New York, executed by  the  applicant  and  a  surety  approved  by  the
      commissioner.  Such  bond  shall  be  conditioned  upon  the applicant's
      compliance with the provisions of  this  subchapter  and  any  rules  or
      regulations  promulgated  hereunder, and upon the further condition that
      the applicant will pay to the city any fine, penalty or other obligation
      within thirty days of its imposition, or any final judgment recovered by
      any person who received towing services from a licensee  thereunder  and
      was  damaged  thereby.  The  commissioner  may in his or her discretion,
      after a public hearing, five days notice of which shall be published  in
      the City Record, increase the amount of the surety bond required by this
      section  to  an  amount  not to exceed twenty-five thousand dollars. The
      commissioner may by regulation authorize an applicant to, in lieu  of  a
      bond,  deposit  cash  to  satisfy the requirements of this section in an
      amount equal to the sum of the surety bond required by this section.
        b.  The  commissioner  may  by  regulation  establish  a  fund  to  be
      administered by the comptroller and authorize an applicant for a license
      to  engage  in  towing  to,  in  lieu of a bond or cash equivalent, make
      contributions to such fund to satisfy the requirements of subdivision  a
      of   this  section.  The  commissioner  may  promulgate  such  rules  or
      regulations as  are  necessary  for  the  administration  of  such  fund
      including,  but not limited to, regulations setting forth the conditions
      for participation in the fund, the contributions required to be made  to
      the  fund  and  the circumstances under which disbursements will be made

      truck to be used by such applicant under such license is insured under a
      liability  insurance  policy as follows: with respect to each tow truck,
      not less than two hundred thousand dollars for personal injury or  death
      of  any  one  person resulting from any one accident; not less than five
      hundred thousand dollars for personal injury or death  of  two  or  more
      persons  resulting  from  any  one  accident;  and  not  less than fifty

Section 20-501 ::    
        
     
        §  20-501  Inspection of tow trucks. a. No license to engage in towing
      shall be issued pursuant to  this  subchapter  unless  the  commissioner
      determines  that  every tow truck to be used by the applicant under such
      license is fit for operation as a towing vehicle  and  is  otherwise  in
      compliance  with  the  provisions of the vehicle and traffic law and any
      regulations promulgated thereunder.
        b. The commissioner may require by regulation  that  every  tow  truck
      used  by  a  licensee  be  inspected periodically by the department, and
      after  finding  such  truck  to  be  fit  for  operation,  may  issue  a
      replaceable  inspection  sticker  of  such  material,  form,  design and
      dimension to be affixed to such truck in such manner as he or she  shall
      prescribe.  The  commissioner  may  by  regulation  impose a fee for any
      inspection in an amount not to exceed fifty dollars in order  to  defray
      the costs of conducting any such inspection.
        c.  Where  a  holder  of  a license to engage in towing acquires a tow
      truck subsequent to the date such license was issued  intended  for  use
      under  such  license  or  intends  to  utilize  a  truck  not previously
      identified in any application for a license to engage  in  towing,  such
      licensee  shall be prohibited from using such truck for towing until the
      licensee has furnished proof that such truck is insured as  required  by
      section  20-500, and that such truck has been inspected and approved for
      use by the department pursuant to this section and the commissioner  has
      issued  a  license  plate  therefor  pursuant  to section 20-503 of this
      subchapter.

--------------

Section 20-502 ::    
        
     
        §  20-502  Premises. No license to engage in towing shall be issued or
      renewed to any applicant where the premises on or in which the  licensed
      business  is  to  be  conducted  are  not  in compliance with the zoning
      resolution and the building code of the city of New York and  any  rules
      or regulations promulgated thereunder.
    
    
    
    
    
    
    

Section 20-503
--------------

Section 20-503 ::    
        
     
        § 20-503 Issuance of license plate. Upon approval of an application to
      engage in towing, the commissioner shall issue to the licensee a license
      plate  for  each  tow  truck to be used under such license. Such license
      plate shall be securely affixed to a conspicuous and indispensable  part
      of  such  truck, and shall clearly set forth the license number assigned
      to the licensee. The license plate issued to the licensee  may,  in  the
      discretion  of the commissioner, be a plate of a permanent nature with a
      replaceable date tag attached thereto, indicating the expiration date of
      the plate. Such license and  replaceable  date  tag  shall  be  of  such
      material,   form,   design  and  dimension  as  the  commissioner  shall
      prescribe. The commissioner, upon renewal of  a  license  to  engage  in
      towing, may continue the use of the license plate for as many additional
      license terms as he or she may determine, in which event he or she shall
      issue  and deliver to the licensee a replaceable date tag as evidence of
      renewal of license, which shall be attached or affixed in such manner as
      he or she may prescribe. The failure to affix or display such  date  tag
      in  a manner prescribed by the commissioner shall constitute a violation
      of this section. In the event of the loss, mutilation or destruction  of
      any  license  plate  or date tag issued hereunder, the licensee may file
      such statement and proof of facts as  the  commissioner  shall  require,
      with  a  fee  of  twenty-five  dollars  per  plate  or  date tag, at the
      department, and the department shall issue  a  duplicate  or  substitute
      license plate or date tag.

--------------

Section 20-504 ::    
        
     
        §  20-504  Renewal,  suspension  and revocation of licenses. After due
      notice and opportunity to be heard, the commissioner may refuse to renew
      any license required under this subchapter and may suspend or revoke any
      such license upon the occurrence of any one or  more  of  the  following
      conditions:
        a.  the  person  holding a tow truck operator's license, or the person
      holding a license to engage in towing or where applicable its  officers,

      percent  of  the outstanding stock of the corporation were found to have
      operated a tow truck in a  grossly  negligent  manner  or  in  a  manner
      showing  a reckless disregard for life or property. For purposes of this
      subdivision, a finding that any  such  person  violated  section  eleven
      hundred  ninety-two  of the vehicle and traffic law in the course of the
      operation of a tow truck shall be deemed gross negligence; or
        c. the person holding a tow truck operator's license,  or  the  person
      holding  a license to engage in towing or where applicable its officers,
      principals, directors or stockholders owning more than  ten  percent  of
      the  outstanding  stock  of  the  corporation have made a material false
      statement or concealed a material fact in connection with the filing  of
      any  application pursuant to this subchapter or have engaged in fraud or
      misrepresentation in connection with the rendering of services; or
        d. the person holding a tow truck operator's license,  or  the  person

      hereunder  or duly imposed in connection with or arising from the use or
      operation of a tow truck or the occupation of the premises on which  the
      licensed business is conducted; or

      officers,  principals,  directors  or  stockholders owning more than ten
      percent of the outstanding stock of the corporation has  been  convicted
      of  a  crime  which,  in  the judgment of the commissioner, has a direct
      relationship to such person's fitness or ability to perform any  of  the
      activities for which a license is required under this subchapter; or has
      been  convicted  of  any  other  crime which, in accordance with article
      twenty-three-a of the correction law, would provide a justification  for
      the  commissioner  to  refuse  to  renew,  or to suspend or revoke, such
      license; or
        f. the person holding a tow truck operator's license,  or  the  person
      holding  a license to engage in towing has failed to maintain any of the

      special circumstances. Notwithstanding any other provision of law, where
      the commissioner has reason to believe that a  tow  truck  operator  has
      committed  an  act  which  would  provide  a  basis  for  suspension  or
      revocation under section 20-504 or 20-504.1 of this subchapter, and  the
      continued  possession  by  such person of a tow truck operator's license
      would  pose  a  serious  danger  to  the  safety  of  the  public,   the
      commissioner  may  immediately  suspend  his or her tow truck operator's
      license. Notwithstanding any other provision of law, upon the suspension
      or revocation pursuant to the vehicle and traffic law of  a  license  to
      operate  a  motor  vehicle that is held by a person who also holds a tow
      truck operator's license pursuant to this subchapter,  the  commissioner
      shall  immediately  suspend  his  or  her  tow truck operator's license.
      Notice of the suspension of a tow truck operator's license  pursuant  to
      this  section  shall  be  served  on  the operator and on the person who
      employs such operator to operate a tow  truck.  The  commissioner  shall
      provide the operator with the opportunity for a hearing within five days
      after the notification of suspension, after which the commissioner shall
      forthwith  make  a  determination  as  to whether such suspension should
      continue and in addition may impose any penalty or sanction provided for
      under this subchapter, provided,  however  that  where  the  license  to
      operate  a  motor  vehicle held by a tow truck operator has been revoked
      pursuant to the vehicle and traffic law, the commissioner  shall  revoke
      such  person's  tow  truck  operator's  license  issued pursuant to this
      subchapter.

      which  has  been revoked by the commissioner pursuant to this subchapter
      shall not  be  permitted  to  apply  for  any  new  license  under  this
      subchapter for a period of three years from the date of such revocation.
      No  license  to  engage  in  towing  shall  be  issued  pursuant to this
      subchapter to a corporation, partnership, or  other  association  if  an
      officer,  principal,  director,  or  stockholder  owning  more  than ten
      percent of the outstanding stock of the corporation of the applicant  is
      or  has been an officer, principal, director, or stockholder owning more
      than ten percent of the  outstanding  stock  of  the  corporation  of  a

        §  20-518  Removal  of  vehicles  involved  in  an accident. a. 1. The
      commissioner shall establish and administer a program to be known as the
      "directed  accident  response  program"  for  the  purpose  of  removing
      vehicles  that  have  been  involved  in  a vehicular accident and which
      cannot be safely driven under their own power. The commissioner  may  by
      rule  prescribe which vehicles involved in vehicular accidents cannot be
      safely driven under their own power.
        2. The commissioner, after consultation with the police  commissioner,
      shall  divide  the city into zones and shall create for each zone a list
      in random order of persons licensed to engage in towing  who  have  been
      approved  by the commissioner for participation in the directed accident
      response program. At any time subsequent to the initial establishment of
      zones and lists, the  commissioner  may,  after  consultation  with  the
      police  commissioner,  modify  the  zones  and  reformulate the lists to
      ensure sufficient towing services throughout the city. Where  more  than
      one  towing  company  has  been  placed  on  a  list of towing companies
      authorized  to  remove  vehicles  in  a  particular  zone,  the   police
      department  shall  summon  towing companies from such list on a rotating
      basis. Any towing company approved for  participation  in  such  program
      after  such  lists are initially established shall be placed on any such
      list at the point immediately preceding the last towing company summoned
      by the police department pursuant to this section. Such lists  shall  be
      available at the department for public inspection.
        3.  The  commissioner  shall  set  forth  by  rules  such criteria for
      participation in the program as he or she deems necessary to  effectuate
      the  purposes  of  this  section. Such criteria shall include but not be
      limited to, possession of a valid, current license to engage  in  towing
      and   compliance   with   this  subchapter  and  any  rules  promulgated
      thereunder, ability to respond within a  specified  period  of  time  to
      police department calls for towing, ability to make service available on
      a  twenty-four  hour  basis or on such limited basis as the commissioner
      shall prescribe, maintenance of specified business hours for  redemption
      of  vehicles and maintenance of a specified minimum number of tow trucks
      and other equipment appropriate  for  towing,  including  at  least  one
      flat-bed truck suitable for removing accident vehicles. All participants
      in  the  program  shall  maintain  a business premises that is under the
      exclusive control of the participant, is not used by  any  other  towing
      company  and  is  the  premises  listed on such participant's license to
      engage in towing. Such premises shall consist of a location that is open
      to the public,  where  towing  company  personnel  are  employed,  calls
      requesting  towing  service  are received and towers are dispatched, and
      where all records required by this subchapter or any  rules  promulgated
      thereunder are maintained.
        4.  All  persons approved by the commissioner for participation in the
      directed  accident  response  program,  in  addition  to   meeting   the
      requirements  of  paragraph  three  of  this  subdivision  and  any rule
      promulgated pursuant to this  section,  shall  (i)  have  been  licensed
      pursuant to this subchapter for a period of not less than one year; (ii)
      have not had such license revoked after due notice and opportunity to be
      heard  at  any  time  during  the  preceding  two year period; and (iii)
      possess a satisfactory record with regard to the operation of  a  towing
      business   as   determined   by   the   commissioner,  provided  that  a
      determination that such record with regard to the operation of a  towing
      business  is  unsatisfactory  shall  be  based  upon  violations of this
      subchapter.
        5. The commissioner may impose a biennial fee for participation in the
      program in order to defray expenses incurred in its administration.
    
        b. 1. Any vehicle that has been involved in a vehicular  accident  and
      which  cannot  be  safely  driven under its own power which has not been
      removed or caused to be removed from the scene of an accident  shall  be
      removed  by  a  tow  truck  of  the  towing company participating in the
      directed  accident  response program when such company has been directed
      to do so by the police department. No such vehicle, other than a vehicle
      that has a maximum gross vehicle weight of  at  least  fifteen  thousand
      pounds,  may be removed by a tow operator chosen by the person in charge
      of such vehicle.
        2. No tow truck operator shall travel en route to, or respond to,  the
      scene or the reported scene of a vehicular accident, or remove a vehicle
      therefrom,  unless a specific request for the services of such tow truck
      operator has been received by such operator or the towing company  which
      employs  such  operator  from a person in charge of a vehicle that has a
      maximum gross vehicle weight of at least  fifteen  thousand  pounds,  or
      unless  such tow truck operator has been directed to do so by the police
      department.
        3. No tow truck of the towing company participating  in  the  directed
      accident  response  program  shall fail to or refuse to remove a vehicle
      that has been involved in a  vehicular  accident  and  which  cannot  be
      safely driven under its own power when such company has been directed to
      do  so  by  the  police  department.  Such vehicle shall be towed to the
      storage  facility  of  such  responding   company   which   meets   such
      specifications  as  the  commissioner  shall  establish by rule, or to a
      location within the city designated by the  person  in  charge  of  such
      vehicle,  provided,  however,  that  placement  of  such vehicle in such
      location is not in violation of any other law.  A  vehicle  towed  to  a
      storage  facility  shall  at  all  times  be  stored within such storage
      facility while the vehicle is in the custody of the towing company. Such
      storage facility shall be the premises listed  on  the  license  of  the
      towing company responding to the police department's direction to remove
      a  vehicle  or the premises approved by the commissioner for use by such
      towing company. Such premises shall be owned, operated or controlled  by
      such  towing  company and shall not be used by any other towing company.
      Nothing in this section shall be  construed  to  preclude  a  person  in
      charge  of a vehicle that has a maximum gross vehicle weight of at least
      fifteen thousand pounds, from arranging for the removal of such  vehicle
      by a tow operator of such person's choice.
        4.  Notwithstanding  any  other provision of this subchapter, a towing
      company that removes an accident vehicle to its storage facility at  the
      place  of business which qualifies such company for participation in the
      directed  accident  response  program  or  to  its   auxiliary   storage
      facilities approved by the commissioner, shall not charge for the towing
      of a vehicle registered at a weight of ten thousand pounds or less a fee
      exceeding  one  hundred and twenty-five dollars or more than twenty-five
      dollars per day for the first three days  of  storage  and  twenty-seven
      dollars for the fourth day, and each day thereafter, of storage for such
      vehicle.  A  towing  company  participating  in  the  directed  accident
      response program shall not charge for the towing of an accident  vehicle
      registered  at a weight of more than ten thousand pounds a fee exceeding
      one hundred and forty dollars or more than twenty-five dollars  per  day
      for  the  first  three  days of storage and twenty-seven dollars for the
      fourth day, and each day thereafter, of storage for such vehicle.
        5. If a person in charge of the vehicle, other than a police  officer,
      requests  that  an  accident vehicle be towed to any location other than
      the storage facilities at the place  of  business  which  qualified  the
      towing  company  removing  the vehicle for participation in the directed
      accident  response  program  or  to  its  auxiliary  storage  facilities
    
      approved  by  the commissioner, the towing company may also, in addition
      to the charges authorized under  paragraph  four  of  this  subdivision,
      charge  the  mileage fee for additional mileage that is authorized under
      section  20-509  of  this subchapter, for the distance traveled from the
      accident scene to the location where the  vehicle  is  towed;  provided,
      however,  that  such distance shall be measured on a route available for
      commercial vehicles from the accident scene to  the  location  to  which
      such vehicle is towed.
        c.  The  police  department  shall  maintain a record of the number of
      times  each  towing  company  participating  in  the  directed  accident
      response  program is summoned to remove vehicles and the number of times
      each such company responds thereto and such  other  information  as  the
      commissioner may prescribe.
        c-1.  Every  towing  company  approved  to participate in the directed
      accident response program shall:
        (1) have on its premises, and accessible to the  public,  a  telephone
      and bathroom facilities:
        (2)  provide reasonable access to an accident vehicle during the hours
      the towing company  is  required  to  be  open  for  the  redemption  of
      vehicles,  at  no charge, to the owner or other person in charge of such
      vehicle, to any insurance agent or insurance adjuster  representing  the
      owner  of  such vehicle, or to any insurance agent or insurance adjuster
      who furnishes sufficient written proof confirming that he or she  is  in
      fact  representing  any  other  person having a claim or defense arising
      from an accident involving such vehicle;
        (3)(a)  impose  no  storage  charge  exceeding  the  amount  permitted
      pursuant  to  section 20-509 of this subchapter during any period before
      the owner or other person in charge of an accident vehicle has signed an
      authorization for the repair of such accident vehicle  with  the  repair
      shop that the towing company has registered pursuant to article twelve-A
      of  the  vehicle  and  traffic law, and (b) where such towing company is
      registered as a repair shop pursuant to article twelve-A of the  vehicle
      and  traffic  law, impose no storage charge during the period from which
      the owner or  other  person  in  charge  of  the  accident  vehicle  has
      authorized  repairs  by  such registered repair shop to one business day
      after such registered repair shop has notified such owner or other  such
      person  in  charge  of such vehicle to pick up the repaired vehicle. For
      purposes  of  determining  whether  a  towing   company   has   violated
      subparagraphs (a) or (b) of this paragraph, such towing company shall be
      deemed  to have committed the violation of another entity if such towing
      company and such other entity share a common officer, director, partner,
      member, manager, principal or shareholder owning five or more percent of
      the outstanding stock, such towing company has any  direct  or  indirect
      interest  in  such  other  entity, or such towing company and such other
      entity share any facilities, equipment, or employees.
        (4) provide to each owner or other person in charge  of  the  accident
      vehicle  an  informational  flyer  entitled the "consumer bill of rights
      regarding towing of accident vehicles and repair  shops"  setting  forth
      the  information  that the commissioner deems appropriate about the laws
      relating to the  consumer's  rights  with  respect  to  the  towing  and
      repairing  of  vehicles.  Such  bill  of rights shall be provided to the
      owner or other person in charge of  the  accident  vehicle  before  such
      vehicle is towed from the accident scene; provided, however, that if the
      owner  or other person in charge of such vehicle is injured and is to be
      removed to a hospital, such bill of rights shall  be  furnished  by  the
      towing  company at the time such owner or such other person in charge of
      such vehicle first appears at the premises of such towing company.
    
        d. In addition  to  the  obligation  to  make  records  available  for
      inspection  by  the  commissioner  pursuant  to  section  20-516 of this
      subchapter, every towing company participating in the directed  accident
      response  program shall, at the request of the police department and for
      the  purpose  of the enforcement of any regulations promulgated pursuant
      to this section, make available for inspection by the police department,
      during reasonable business hours, any records required to be  maintained
      under this subchapter.
        e.  After due notice and opportunity to be heard, the commissioner may
      disqualify any towing company participating  in  the  directed  accident
      response  program  from  continued  participation  in  such  program for
      violation of  any  of  the  provisions  of  this  section  or  any  rule
      promulgated  hereunder  or upon the occurrence of any one or more of the
      conditions set forth in this subchapter  which  constitute  grounds  for
      suspension  or  revocation  of any license issued under this subchapter;
      provided, however, that the commissioner, for good cause, may, prior  to
      giving  notice  and  an  opportunity  to be heard, temporarily suspend a
      towing company from participation  in  the  directed  accident  response
      program for up to ten days. Notice of such suspension shall be served on
      the  towing  company.  The commissioner shall provide the towing company
      with  the  opportunity  for  a  hearing  within  ten  days   after   the
      notification of suspension, after which the commissioner shall forthwith
      make  a  determination as to whether such suspension should continue and
      the length of such suspension and in addition may impose any penalty  or
      sanction authorized by this subchapter.
        f.  Any person participating in the directed accident response program
      who violates  the  provisions  of  section  20-496  of  this  subchapter
      regarding engaging in towing without having first obtained a license for
      such  towing business and a license plate for each tow truck, driving or
      otherwise operating a tow truck or assisting in any activity for which a
      license is required under this subchapter without having first  obtained
      a tow truck operator's license, or permitting or authorizing the driving
      or  other  operation  of  a tow truck by a person who does not possess a
      current, valid tow truck operator's license in violation of  subdivision
      c of section 20-496 of this subchapter shall be removed from the list of
      approved  towing  companies and shall be ineligible for participation in
      the directed accident response program for a period of six  months.  Any
      such  person who has been found guilty of two such violations within the
      preceding twenty-four month period shall be removed  from  the  list  of
      approved  towing  companies and shall be ineligible for participation in
      the directed accident response program for a period of one year.
        g.  The  commissioner  may  promulgate  such  additional   rules   and
      regulations  as  he or she deems necessary to effectuate the purposes of
      this section.
        g-1. 1. After due notice and opportunity to be heard, the commissioner
      may remove or suspend, for  a  period  not  to  exceed  one  year,  from
      continued  participation  in  the directed accident response program any
      towing company participating in such program which:
        (a) was unavailable to respond to a police dispatch or has  failed  to
      respond to a police dispatch for removing a vehicle from the scene of an
      accident on at least three occasions within any six month period;

        (c) failed to  or  refused  to  release  any  accident  vehicle  after
      presentation  of  sufficient  proof  of  ownership  or  owner's  written

      section  20-520.1  of  this  subchapter  and   any   rules   promulgated
      thereunder.
        2.  The  grounds  for  suspension  or removal of a towing company from
      continued  participation  in  the  directed  accident  response  program
      specified  in paragraph one of this subdivision shall be in addition to,
      and shall not in any way limit, the commissioner's authority to  revoke,
      suspend, or refuse to renew a license issued pursuant to this subchapter
      or  to  suspend or remove from participation any towing company from the

Section 20-518.1 ::    
        
     
        * §    20-518.1   Special   accident   response   districts.   a.   1.
      Notwithstanding any inconsistent  provisions  of  this  subchapter,  the
      commissioner  may  by  rule designate one or more areas of the city as a
      special accident response district, provided, however, that such special
      accident response districts shall not in combination encompass more than
      seven police precincts. One but not more  than  three  towing  companies
      shall  be assigned by the commissioner to each zone located in a special
      accident response district and shall have the responsibility of removing
      vehicles that have been involved in a vehicular accident  in  such  zone
      and  which  cannot  be safely driven under their own power. No more than
      one such towing company shall have the responsibility for removing  such
      vehicles  in  a  particular  zone  within  a  special  accident response
      district during any specified period of time. The  commissioner  may  by
      rule  prescribe which vehicles involved in vehicular accidents cannot be
      safely driven under their own power. Notwithstanding any other provision
      of this section, the commissioner may by rule establish  an  alternative
      procedure for providing towing services for accident vehicles in certain
      circumstances  where  towing services will not be adequately provided by
      the towing companies participating  in  the  special  accident  response
      districts.
        2.  The  commissioner, after consultation with the police commissioner
      and the tow advisory board created pursuant to section  20-526  of  this
      subchapter,  shall  set forth by rule the division of a special accident
      response district into zones for the removal of  accident  vehicles  and
      may  modify  the  zones  from  time  to time to ensure sufficient towing
      services throughout such district. In determining the boundaries of  the
      zones,  the  commissioner  may  consider,  but  shall  not be limited to
      considering, the following:
        (a) the boundaries of police precincts, commands and sectors;
        (b) vehicular accident statistics;
        (c) traffic patterns and other factors related to the response time of
      towing companies; and
        (d) the density of licensed towing company facilities.
        b. 1. The commissioner shall set  forth  by  rule  such  criteria  for
      pre-qualifying  a towing company to apply for a particular zone or zones
      in a special accident response district as he or she deems necessary  to
      effectuate  the  purposes  of this section. Such criteria shall include,
      but not be limited to (a) possession for a period of not less  than  one
      year  of a valid, current license to engage in towing issued pursuant to
      this subchapter, which license has not been revoked after due notice and
      an opportunity to be heard at any time during  the  preceding  two  year
      period, (b) possession of a satisfactory record with regard to operation
      of  a towing business as determined by the commissioner, provided that a
      determination that such record with regard to the operation of a  towing
      business  is  unsatisfactory  shall  be  based  upon  violations of this
      subchapter and any rules promulgated thereunder, (c) fitness to  provide
      towing service, (d) ability to respond within a specified period of time
      to  an  accident that has occurred in the zone, (e) the proximity of the
      towing company's place of business and storage facilities  to  the  zone
      applied for, (f) ability to make service available on a twenty-four hour
      basis,  (g)  maintenance  of  specified business hours for redemption of
      vehicles, (h) registration as a repair shop pursuant to article twelve-A
      of the vehicle and traffic law, and (i) maintenance of a minimum  number
      of tow trucks and other equipment appropriate for towing. In addition to
      such  criteria, a towing company shall maintain a business premises that
      is under the exclusive control of such towing company, is  not  used  by
      any  other  towing  company  and  is  the premises listed on such towing
      company's license to engage in towing. Such premises shall consist of  a
    
      location  that is open to the public, where towing company personnel are
      employed, calls requesting towing service are received  and  towers  are
      dispatched,  and  where  all  records required by this subchapter or any
      rules promulgated thereunder are maintained.
        2.  Where  more  than  one  towing  company  meets  the  criteria  for
      assignment to  a  particular  zone,  the  commissioner  may  use  random
      selection  procedures  such  as  a lottery to assign a towing company to
      such zone and to a specified time period. Zone assignment shall  be  for
      such period of time as the commissioner shall proscribe by rule.
        3.  The commissioner shall by rule establish procedures to be followed
      in the event that it is  impracticable  or  impossible  for  the  towing
      company  assigned to a zone and to a specified time period to respond to
      an accident scene or to remove a vehicle therefrom in a  timely  manner,
      and  the  commissioner  may  pre-qualify  towing companies to serve as a
      back-up response in such event.
        4. The commissioner may by rule establish  standards  of  service  and
      performance  and  methods of identification of tow trucks which shall be
      complied with by all towing companies assigned by  the  commissioner  to
      have  the  responsibility  for removing accident vehicles in a zone. The
      commissioner shall not require the full body of  a  tow  truck  of  such
      towing company to be painted a certain color.
        c.  1.  Any  vehicle  located in a zone in a special accident response
      district that has been involved in a vehicular accident and which cannot
      be safely driven under its own power  which  has  not  been  removed  or
      caused to be removed from the scene of an accident shall be removed by a
      tow truck of the towing company authorized by the commissioner to remove
      such  vehicle  from  such zone at that particular time. No such vehicle,
      other than a vehicle that has a maximum gross vehicle weight of at least
      fifteen thousand pounds, may be removed by a tow operator  chosen  by  a
      person in charge of such vehicle.
        2.  No  tow truck operator shall travel enroute to, or respond to, the
      scene of a vehicular accident, or remove a vehicle therefrom, in a  zone
      located  within  a  special accident response district unless a specific
      request for the services of such tow truck operator has been received by
      such operator or the towing company which employs such operator  from  a
      person in charge of a vehicle that has a maximum gross vehicle weight of
      at  least  fifteen  thousand  pounds,  or  unless such operator has been
      assigned by the commissioner to have  the  responsibility  for  removing
      accident  vehicles  in  such  zone  located  within  a  special accident
      response district at that particular time, or has been pre-qualified  by
      the commissioner and has been directed to serve as a back-up response at
      that  particular time, or is otherwise authorized by the commissioner to
      remove a vehicle therefrom.
        3. No tow truck of the towing company authorized by  the  commissioner
      to  remove  vehicles  involved in a vehicular accident in a zone located
      within a special accident response district shall fail to or  refuse  to
      remove  a vehicle that has been involved in a vehicular accident in such
      zone and which cannot be safely driven under its own power which has not
      been removed or caused to be removed from the scene of an accident. Such
      vehicle shall be towed by a tow truck of such responding towing  company
      to  the storage facility of such company, which facility shall meet such
      specifications as the commissioner shall establish  by  rule,  or  to  a
      location  designated  by the person in charge of such vehicle, provided,
      however, that such location is within the police precinct in  which  the
      vehicular  accident  occurred  or  a  police  precinct directly adjacent
      thereto and placement of  such  vehicle  in  such  location  is  not  in
      violation  of any other law. A vehicle towed to a storage facility shall
      at all times be stored within such facility while the vehicle is in  the
    
      custody  of  the  towing  company.  Such  storage  facility shall be the
      premises listed on the license of the towing  company  or  the  premises
      approved  by  the  commissioner  for  use  by  such towing company. Such
      premises  shall  be owned, operated or controlled by such towing company
      and shall not be used by any other towing company. In order  to  respond
      to  the scene of an accident in the towing company's assigned zone, such
      company shall be permitted to maintain and use in such  company's  place
      of   business  for  the  purpose  of  receiving  and  monitoring  police
      communications  a  radio  receiving  set  or  other  device  capable  of
      receiving  signals  or messages transmitted on the frequencies allocated
      for police use.
        d. The commissioner may impose a fee upon a towing company  which  has
      been  assigned to a zone pursuant to this section in order to defray the
      expenses incurred in the administration and enforcement of this section.
        e. The police department shall maintain a record of  such  information
      as  the  commissioner,  after consultation with the police commissioner,
      may prescribe as would be useful in  determining  the  effectiveness  of
      special accident response districts.
        f.  In  addition  to  the  obligation  to  make  records available for
      inspection by the  commissioner  pursuant  to  section  20-516  of  this
      subchapter,  every  towing  company  which  has  been assigned to a zone
      pursuant to this section shall, at the request of the police  department
      and  for  the  purpose  of  the enforcement of this section or any rules
      promulgated hereunder, make  available  for  inspection  by  the  police
      department, during reasonable business hours, any records required to be
      maintained under this subchapter.
        g.  After  due notice and an opportunity to be heard, the commissioner
      may remove any towing  company  from  the  responsibility  for  removing
      accident  vehicles  in  a particular zone during a specified time period
      where the commissioner finds that the towing company  has  not  complied
      with  the  standards  of service and performance prescribed by rule, has
      engaged in any fraudulent business practices or has violated any of  the
      provisions  of  this  subchapter  or any rules promulgated hereunder, or
      upon the occurrence of any one or more of the conditions  set  forth  in
      this subchapter which constitute grounds for suspension or revocation of
      any  license  issued  under  the subchapter; provided, however, that the
      commissioner, for good  cause,  may,  prior  to  giving  notice  and  an
      opportunity  to  be heard, temporarily suspend a towing company from the
      responsibility for removing  accident  vehicles  in  a  particular  zone
      during  a  specified  time  period  for  up  to ten days. Notice of such
      suspension shall be served on the towing company. The commissioner shall
      provide the towing company with the opportunity for a hearing within ten
      days after the notification of suspension, after which the  commissioner
      shall  forthwith  make  a  determination  as  to whether such suspension
      should continue and the length of such suspension, and in  addition  may
      impose  any  penalty  or  sanction authorized by this subchapter. In the
      event of the removal, termination or withdrawal of  any  towing  company
      from  the  responsibility for removing accident vehicles in a particular
      zone, the commissioner shall, pursuant to the  procedures  described  in
      subdivision  b  of  this  section  and any rules promulgated thereunder,
      select a new towing company to provide towing service in the zone during
      a specified time period for the unexpired portion of the term.
        h. Any person participating in the removal of vehicles involved  in  a
      vehicular  accident in a zone located within a special accident response
      district  who  violates  the  provisions  of  section  20-496  of   this
      subchapter  regarding engaging in towing without having first obtained a
      license for such towing business and a license plate for each tow truck,
      driving or otherwise operating a tow truck or assisting in any  activity
    
      for  which  a  license  is required under this subchapter without having
      first  obtained  a  tow  truck  operator's  license,  or  permitting  or
      authorizing  the  driving  or other operation of a tow truck by a person
      who  does  not  possess a current, valid tow truck operator's license in
      violation of subdivision c of section 20-496 of this subchapter shall be
      removed from the responsibility for  removing  accident  vehicles  in  a
      particular  zone  during a specified time period and shall be ineligible
      for participation in the removal of accident vehicles in  zones  located
      within  special  accident response districts for a period of six months.
      Any such person who has been found guilty of two such violations  within
      the   preceding   twenty-four  month  period  shall  be  ineligible  for
      participation in the removal  of  accident  vehicles  in  zones  located
      within special accident response districts for a period of one year.
        i.  The provisions of this section shall not apply to the removal of a
      vehicle that is located in a zone designated by the commissioner as part
      of the "directed accident response program" pursuant to  section  20-518
      of  this subchapter or to the removal of a vehicle from any location for
      which the authorization of the commissioner  of  transportation  or  the
      police commissioner is required to remove such vehicle therefrom.
        j.  The commissioner may promulgate such additional rules as he or she
      deems necessary to effectuate the purposes of this section.

Section 20-519 ::    
        
     
        §  20-519 Removal of stolen, abandoned and evidence vehicles, vehicles
      blocking a private driveway and vehicles with certain alarm devices.  a.
      1.  The  commissioner  shall  establish  a  program  to  be known as the
      "rotation tow program" for the purpose of  removing  evidence  vehicles,
      vehicles  suspected  of  having  been  stolen  or  abandoned  other than
      vehicles  described  in  subdivision  two  of  section  twelve   hundred
      twenty-four  of  the  vehicle  and  traffic law, the removal pursuant to
      section 19-169 of the code of vehicles blocking a private driveway,  and
      the  removal  pursuant  to  section  24-221 of the code of vehicles with
      certain alarm devices.
        2. The commissioner, after consultation with the police  commissioner,
      shall  divide  the city into zones and shall create for each zone a list
      in random order of persons licensed to engage in towing  who  have  been
      approved  by  the  commissioner  for  participation  in the rotation tow
      program. The commissioner may in his or her discretion create from  such
      list  separate  lists  for  the removal of evidence vehicles, stolen and
      abandoned vehicles, the removal pursuant to section 19-169 of  the  code
      of  vehicles  blocking  a  private driveway, and the removal pursuant to
      section 24-221 of the code  of  vehicles  with  certain  alarm  devices,
      respectively.  At  any  time  subsequent to the initial establishment of
      zones and lists, the  commissioner  may,  after  consultation  with  the
      police  commissioner,  modify  the  zones  and  reformulate the lists to
      ensure sufficient towing services throughout the city. Where  more  than
      one  towing  company  has  been  placed  on  a  list of towing companies
      authorized  to  remove  vehicles  in  a  particular  zone,  the   police
      department  shall  summon  towing companies from such list on a rotating

        f. Any vehicle that has not been claimed by the owner within ten  days
      after  adjudication  by the commissioner of the violation underlying the
      seizure shall be deemed by the department to be abandoned. Such  vehicle

      for  which  a  license  is required pursuant to subdivision a of section
      20-496 of this subchapter without such license, both of which violations

        2. A forfeiture action which is commenced pursuant to this subdivision
      shall be commenced by the filing of a summons with notice or  a  summons
      and  complaint in accordance with the civil practice law and rules. Such

      accordance  with  the  civil practice law and rules on all owners of the
      subject vehicle listed in the records maintained by  the  department  of
      motor vehicles, or for vehicles not registered in New York state, in the
      records  maintained by the state of registration. A vehicle which is the
      subject of such action shall remain in the custody of the department  or
      other   appropriate  agency  pending  the  final  determination  of  the
      forfeiture action.
        3. Notice of the institution of the forfeiture action shall  be  given
      by  first  class mail to all persons holding a security interest in such
      vehicle which security interest has been filed with  the  department  of
      motor  vehicles  pursuant  to the provisions of title ten of the vehicle
      and traffic law, at the  address  set  forth  in  the  records  of  such
      department,  or  for  vehicles  not  registered  in  New York state, all
      persons who hold a security interest  in  such  vehicle  which  security
      interest  has  been  filed  with  such  state  of registration and which
      persons are made known by such state to the department, at  the  address
      provided by such state of registration.
        4.  Any  owner  who receives notice of the institution of a forfeiture

      assert  a  claim  in  such  action  for  the  recovery of the vehicle or
      satisfaction of the owner's interest in such vehicle. Any person with  a
      security interest in such vehicle who receives notice of the institution
      of  the forfeiture action who claims an interest in such vehicle subject
      to forfeiture may assert a claim in such action for satisfaction of such
      person's security interest in such vehicle.
        5. Forfeiture pursuant to this subdivision shall be  made  subject  to
      the  interest of a person who claims an interest in the vehicle pursuant
      to paragraph four of this subdivision,  where  such  person  establishes
      that:  (i) the use of the vehicle for the conduct that was the basis for
      seizure of the vehicle occurred without the knowledge of such person, or
      if  such  person  had  knowledge  of  such use, that such person did not
      consent to such use by doing all that could reasonably have been done to
      prevent such use, and that such person did  not  knowingly  obtain  such
      interest  in  the  vehicle  in  order  to  avoid  the forfeiture of such
      vehicle; or (ii) that the conduct that was the basis  for  such  seizure
      was  committed by any person other than such person claiming an interest
      in the vehicle, while such vehicle was unlawfully in the possession of a
      person who acquired possession thereof in violation of the criminal laws
      of the United States or any state.
        6. The department or agency  having  custody  of  the  vehicle,  after
      judicial  determination of forfeiture, shall, at its discretion, either:
      (i) retain such vehicle for the official use of the  city  or;  (ii)  by
      public  notice  of  at  least  five days, sell such forfeited vehicle at
      public sale. The net proceeds of any such sale shall be  paid  into  the
      general fund of the city.
    
        7.  In  any  forfeiture action commenced pursuant to this subdivision,
      where the court awards a  sum  of  money  to  one  or  more  persons  in
      satisfaction  of  such  person  or  persons'  interest  in the forfeited
      vehicle, the total amount awarded to satisfy such interest or  interests
      shall  not  exceed  the  amount  of  the net proceeds of the sale of the
      forfeited vehicle after deduction of the lawful expenses incurred by the
      city, including the reasonable costs  of  removal  and  storage  of  the
      vehicle between the time of seizure and the date of sale.
