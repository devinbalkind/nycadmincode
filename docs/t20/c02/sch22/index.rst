      solicitor  a  penalty of five hundred dollars in addition to any damages
      sustained by him or her by reason of such statements or  representations
      made by the contractor or by his or her agents or employees.

      mean  an  owner  as  defined  in section one hundred twenty-eight and in
      subdivision three of section three hundred eighty-eight of  the  vehicle
      and traffic law.

      mean the conduct of  any  activity  for  which  a  license  is  required
      pursuant  to subdivision a of section 20-387 of this subchapter, without
      such license.
        b. Any police  officer  or  authorized  officer  or  employee  of  the
      department,  upon  service  on  the  owner or operator of a vehicle of a
      notice of violation for engaging in unlicensed  activity,  may  seize  a
      vehicle  which such police officer or authorized officer or employee has
      reasonable cause to believe  is  being  used  in  connection  with  such
      violation.  Any  vehicle  seized  pursuant  to this subdivision shall be
      delivered into the  custody  of  the  department  or  other  appropriate
      agency.  The  commissioner  shall  hold  a  hearing  to  adjudicate  the
      violation underlying the seizure within five  business  days  after  the
      date  of  seizure and shall render his or her determination within three
      business days after the conclusion of the  hearing.  Such  determination
      shall  also include a finding as to whether or not such vehicle was used
      in connection with such violation.
        c. An owner may  obtain  release  of  a  vehicle  seized  pursuant  to
      subdivision  b of this section prior to the hearing provided for in such
      subdivision, if such owner has not previously been found to have engaged
      in unlicensed activity within a five-year period prior to the  violation
      resulting  in such seizure. The vehicle shall be released to an eligible
      owner upon the posting of an all cash bond in a form satisfactory to the
      commissioner in an amount sufficient to cover the maximum fines or civil
      penalties which may be imposed for the violation underlying the  seizure
      and all reasonable costs for removal and storage of such vehicle.
        d.  After adjudication of the violation underlying the seizure, if the
      commissioner finds that the vehicle has not been used in connection with
      unlicensed activity, the department shall promptly release such  vehicle
      upon written demand of its owner.
        e.  After adjudication of the violation underlying the seizure, if the
      commissioner finds that the vehicle has been  used  in  connection  with
      unlicensed  activity  then:  (i)  if  the  vehicle  is  not  subject  to
      forfeiture pursuant to paragraph one of subdivision g of  this  section,
      the  department  shall  release such vehicle to an owner upon payment of
      all applicable fines and civil penalties and  all  reasonable  costs  of
      removal  and  storage;  or  (ii) if the vehicle is subject to forfeiture
      pursuant to  paragraph  one  of  subdivision  g  of  this  section,  the
      department  may  release  such  vehicle  to an owner upon payment of all
      applicable fines and civil penalties and all reasonable costs of removal
      and storage, or may commence a forfeiture action within ten  days  after
      the owner's written demand for such vehicle.
        f.  Any vehicle that has not been claimed by the owner within ten days
      after adjudication by the commissioner of the violation  underlying  the
      seizure  shall be deemed by the department to be abandoned. Such vehicle
      shall be disposed of  by  the  department  pursuant  to  section  twelve
      hundred twenty-four of the vehicle and traffic law.
        g.  1. In addition to any other fine, penalty or sanction provided for
      in section 20-401 of this code, a vehicle seized pursuant to subdivision
      b of this section, and all rights, title and interest therein  shall  be
    
      subject to forfeiture to the city upon notice and judicial determination
      thereof  if the owner of such vehicle has been found liable at least two
      times within a five-year period for engaging in unlicensed activity, and
      each  of  those determinations have included findings that a vehicle was
      used in connection with such violations.
        2. A forfeiture action pursuant to this subdivision shall be commenced
      by the filing of a summons with a notice or a summons and  complaint  in
      accordance  with  the  civil  practice  law and rules. Such summons with
      notice or a summons and complaint shall be served in accordance with the
      civil practice law and rules on all owners of the subject vehicle listed
      in the records maintained by the department of motor  vehicles,  or  for
      vehicles  not  registered  in  the  state  of  New  York, in the records
      maintained by the state of registration. A vehicle which is the  subject
      of  such  action  shall remain in the custody of the department or other
      appropriate agency pending the final  determination  of  the  forfeiture
      action.
        3.  Notice  of the institution of the forfeiture action shall be given
      by first-class mail to all persons holding a security interest  in  such
      vehicle, if such security interest has been filed with the department of
      motor  vehicles  pursuant  to the provisions of title ten of the vehicle
      and traffic law, at the  address  set  forth  in  the  records  of  such
      department, or for vehicles not registered in the state of New York, all
      persons  holding  a  security  interest in such vehicle if such security
      interest has been filed with the state of registration and which persons
      are made known by such state to the department, at the address  provided
      by such state of registration.
        4.  Any  owner  who receives notice of the institution of a forfeiture
      action who claims an interest in the vehicle subject to  forfeiture  may
      assert  a  claim  in  such  action  for  the  recovery of the vehicle or
      satisfaction of the owner's interest in such vehicle. Any person with  a
      security interest in such vehicle who receives notice of the institution
      of  the forfeiture action who claims an interest in such vehicle subject
      to forfeiture may assert a claim in such action for satisfaction of such
      person's security interest in such vehicle.
        5. Forfeiture pursuant to this subdivision shall be  made  subject  to
      the  interest of a person who claims an interest in the vehicle pursuant
      to paragraph four of this subdivision,  where  such  person  establishes
      that:  (i) the use of the vehicle for the conduct that was the basis for
      the seizure of the  vehicle  occurred  without  the  knowledge  of  such
      person,  or  if  such person had knowledge of such use, that such person
      did not consent to such use by doing all that could reasonably have been
      done to prevent such use, and that such person did not knowingly  obtain
      such  interest  in  the vehicle in order to avoid the forfeiture of such
      vehicle, or (ii) that the conduct that was the basis  for  such  seizure
      was  committed by any person other than such person claiming an interest
      in the vehicle, while such vehicle was unlawfully in the possession of a
      person who acquired possession thereof in violation of the criminal laws
      of the United States or any state.
        6. The department or agency  having  custody  of  the  vehicle,  after
      judicial  determination  of forfeiture, shall, at its discretion, either
      (i) retain such vehicle for the official use of the  city;  or  (ii)  by
      public  notice  of  at  least  five days, sell such forfeited vehicle at
      public sale. The net proceeds of any such sale shall be  paid  into  the
      general fund of the city.
        7.  In  any  forfeiture action commenced pursuant to this subdivision,
      where the court awards a  sum  of  money  to  one  or  more  persons  in
      satisfaction  of  such  person's  interest in the forfeited vehicle, the
      total amount awarded to satisfy such interest  or  interests  shall  not
    
      exceed  the  amount  of  the  net  proceeds of the sale of the forfeited
      vehicle after deduction of the lawful expenses  incurred  by  the  city,
      including reasonable costs of removal and storage of the vehicle between
      the time of seizure and the date of sale.
