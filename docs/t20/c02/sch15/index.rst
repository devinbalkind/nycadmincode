Section 20-306 ::    
        
     
        §  20-306 Proof of qualifications; fingerprinting. a. The commissioner
      shall require  any  applicant  for  a  locksmith's  license  to  furnish
      documentary  proof  that he or she is a qualified locksmith, and if such
      evidence is not satisfactory to the commissioner, the  commissioner  may
      require  the  applicant  to  submit  to  any examination by at least two
      licensed locksmiths to be named by the commissioner,  to  serve  without
      compensation,   and   such  licensed  locksmiths,  after  examining  the
      applicant shall certify in writing to the commissioner  whether  or  not
      the  applicant in their opinion is sufficiently qualified to be licensed
      as a locksmith.
        b. The commissioner shall require that applicants for licenses  issued
      pursuant to this subchapter be fingerprinted for the purpose of securing
      criminal  history  records  from  the state division of criminal justice
      services. The applicant shall pay a processing fee as  required  by  the
      state division of criminal justice services. Fingerprints shall be taken
      of  the  individual owner if the applicant is a sole proprietorship; the
      general partners if the applicant is a partnership;  and  the  officers,
      principals,  directors, and stockholders owning more than ten percent of
      the  outstanding  stock  of  the  corporation  if  the  applicant  is  a
      corporation.  Any  person  required  to be fingerprinted hereunder shall
      furnish to the department three  current  passport-size  photographs  of
      such  person.  Notwithstanding  the foregoing, the commissioner need not
      require applicants for licenses required under  this  subchapter  to  be
      fingerprinted if criminal history records concerning such applicants are
      not available from the state division of criminal justice services.

      based on criminal conviction. In addition to any of the powers that  may

      one of this title, the commissioner, after notice and an opportunity  to
      be  heard,  may  refuse  to  issue or renew, or may suspend or revoke, a

      any of its principals, officers or directors, or any of its stockholders
      owning more than ten percent of the outstanding stock of the corporation
      has   been   convicted  of  a  crime  which,  in  the  judgment  of  the
      commissioner, has a direct relationship  to  such  person's  fitness  or
      ability to perform any of the activities for which a license is required
      under this subchapter or has been convicted of any other crime which, in
      accordance  with  article  twenty-three-a  of  the correction law, would
      provide a justification for the  commissioner  to  refuse  to  issue  or
      renew, or to suspend or revoke, such license.
