        § 20-465.1 Street Vendor Review Panel.  a. There is hereby established
      a  street  vendor  review  panel  consisting of four members. Such panel
      shall include the commissioner  of  the  department  of  small  business
      services,  the  director  of  the  department  of  city planning and the
      commissioner of the department of transportation,  or  their  respective
      designees. Such panel shall also include a member appointed by the mayor
      upon  nomination by the speaker of the council.  The commissioner of the
      department of small business services or his or her designee shall serve
      as  chairperson.  The  departments  of  small  business  services,  city
      planning  and transportation shall provide such assistance as the street
      vendor review panel deems necessary and appropriate to enable such panel
      to carry out its responsibilities. In the same  manner  as  provided  in
      section  1043  of the city charter, the street vendor review panel shall
      promulgate, and may from time  to  time  amend,  rules  prohibiting  the
      operation  of  any general vending business or food vending business, as
      defined in chapter three of title seventeen of this code,  or  both,  on
      any  street, at any time, after making a determination that such vending
      business would constitute a serious and immediate threat to the  health,
      safety  and  well-being  of the public on the ground that such street at
      such time is regularly too congested by pedestrian or vehicular  traffic
      to  permit  the  operation  of  such business. No general vendor or food
