Subchapter 30 - DEBT COLLECTION AGENCIES
========================================

Section 20-488
--------------

Section 20-488 ::    
        
     
        §  20-488  Legislative  declaration.  The  council  hereby  finds  the
      presence of consumer related problems with respect to the  practices  of
      debt  collection  agencies whose sole concern is the collection of debts
      owed to their clients. While the  majority  of  those  engaged  in  this
      business  are  honest and ethical in their dealings, there is a minority
      of unscrupulous collection agencies in operation that  practice  abusive
      tactics  such  as threatening delinquent debtors, or calling such people
      at outrageous times of the night. These actions constitute tactics which
      would shock the conscience of ordinary  people.  Due  to  the  sensitive
      nature  of  the information used in the course of such agency's everyday
      business, and the vulnerable position consumers find themselves in  when
      dealing  with  these  agencies,  it  is  incumbent  upon this council to
      protect the interests, reputations and fiscal well-being of the citizens
      of this city against those agencies who would abuse their  privilege  of
      operation.  It  is  herein  declared  that  the city should license debt
      collection agencies.

      transaction  are  primarily for personal, family, or household purposes,
      whether or not such obligation has been  reduced  to  judgment,  or  any
      obligation  or  alleged  obligation  arising  out of a judgment or valid

      be advised that any fees must bear  a  reasonable  relationship  to  the
      amount of child support actually collected.
        (vi)  A  potential  client  shall  be  advised that child support debt

        (iii)  A  potential client shall be provided a summary of all contract
      termination provisions, including, but not limited to, the specific date
      on which such contract shall terminate. If no specific date is  provided
      in  the contract, the debt collection agency shall describe how and when
      such contract will terminate.
        (iv) A potential client shall be advised  that,  by  law,  a  contract

      form  required  under  section 20-494.1 (e) together with a copy of such
      agency's standard contract for child  support  payment  debt  collection
      services within sixty days following the effective date of the local law
      that added such section.
        g.  As  a  condition  to  the  issuance  of a license to provide child
      support payment debt collection services, each applicant  shall  furnish
      to  the  commissioner a surety bond in the sum of five thousand dollars,
      payable to the city of New York, executed by such applicant and a surety
      approved by the commissioner. Such bond shall be  conditioned  upon  the
      applicant's  compliance  with  the provisions of this subchapter and any
      rules  or  regulations  promulgated  hereunder,  and  upon  the  further
      condition  that such applicant will pay to the city any fine, penalty or

      judgment recovered by any person who received child support payment debt
      collection  services from a licensee thereunder and was damaged thereby.
      The commissioner may, by rule, increase the amount of  the  surety  bond
      required by this section to an amount not to exceed twenty-five thousand
      dollars. The commissioner may by rule authorize an applicant to, in lieu
      of  a  bond, deposit cash to satisfy the requirements of this section in
      an amount equal to the sum of the surety bond required by this section.
        h. The commissioner may by rule establish a fund to be administered by
      the comptroller and authorize an applicant  for  a  license  to  provide
      child  support payment debt collection services to, in lieu of a bond or
      cash  equivalent,  make  contributions  to  such  fund  to  satisfy  the
      requirements  of  subdivision  g  of  this section. The commissioner may
      promulgate  such  rules  or  regulations  as  are  necessary   for   the
      administration of such fund including, but not limited to, rules setting
      forth  the  conditions  for participation in the fund, the contributions
      required to be made to  the  fund  and  the  circumstances  under  which
      disbursements will be made from the fund.
        i.  The  commissioner may promulgate such rules as may be necessary to
      carry out the provisions of this section.
