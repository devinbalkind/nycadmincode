      services and shall pay  a  processing  fee  as  required  by  the  state
      division  of  criminal  justice  services. Where the applicant is a sole

      this subchapter if such applicant or  any  employee  or  agent  of  such
      applicant  has  engaged  in  conduct  which would constitute a basis for
      license suspension or revocation under this title.

      five of this title and any rules promulgated thereunder,  and  upon  the
