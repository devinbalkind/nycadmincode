      immediately  adjacent  to  its  premises, a sidewalk cafe, provided that
      such sidewalk cafe shall be granted a license and a revocable consent by
      the commissioner.
        b. The commissioner, consistent with the provisions of this subchapter
      and the applicable provisions of the zoning resolution, shall  establish
      such  rules, regulations, terms and conditions as the commissioner deems
      proper in respect to the granting and  issuance  of  such  licenses  and
      revocable  consents,  priorities  or  rights  between  applicants  for a
      license covering the same  space,  and  operation  (including  hours  of
      operation,  provided  that  no  such rule, regulation, term or condition
      shall prevent licensed sidewalk cafes from operating during the hours of
      10:00 a.m. through 12:00 a.m. daily or  shall  allow  licensed  sidewalk
      cafes  to  operate  before 10:00 a.m. on Sundays) and maintenance of any
      sidewalk cafe, to ensure good order and to prevent undue obstruction  of
      the sidewalk, which shall have the force and effect of law. A license to
      operate a sidewalk cafe shall be issued after the review and approval of
      a  petition  for  a  revocable  consent  to  construct  and operate such
      sidewalk cafe pursuant to the provisions of section  20-225,  20-226  or

        c. No license shall be granted for an enclosed sidewalk cafe until  an
      alteration  permit  or  any  other  required  permit  is  issued  by the
      department of buildings. No license shall be granted for a sidewalk cafe
      located in a historic district,  on  a  landmark  site  or  attached  or

      No license shall be granted for an unenclosed cafe which  obstructs  the
      means  of  egress  from any portion of a building nor for any unenclosed
      cafe with an awning unless a permit therefor is issued by the department
      of buildings.
        d. The fee for such license shall be at the rate of five  hundred  and
      ten  dollars  for  a  two-year  license.  Such  license  fee shall be in
      addition to any fee imposed, pursuant to rules of the commissioner, upon
      approval of a petition for a revocable consent, or  a  renewal  of  such
      revocable consent, to construct and operate a sidewalk cafe or any other
      applicable fee.
        e.  A  licensee  must provide waiter or waitress service to patrons in
      the sidewalk cafe if alcohol is served. If no alcohol is served  at  the
      restaurant,  a licensee must provide adequate service to maintain tables
      in the sidewalk cafe and the adjacent sidewalk in a manner that  ensures
      good order and cleanliness.
        f. The license shall be personal to the applicant and may not be sold,
      leased  or  transferred  and  shall  be  deemed  revoked  by the sale or

      days of the receipt thereof. The failure of an agency  to  indicate  its
      objections within the prescribed time to the department of city planning
      shall be construed to mean that such agency has no objections.
        c.  If  no objections to such petition are filed within the twenty-one
      day period prescribed in subdivision b of this section,  the  department
      of  city  planning shall forward the petition within five days after the

Section 20-227.1. ::    
        
     
        ยง 20-227.1. a. Any person found to be operating an unlicensed sidewalk
      cafe shall be liable for a civil penalty of at least two hundred and not
      more  than  one  thousand  dollars for the first violation, at least two
      hundred and not more than  one  thousand  dollars  for  each  additional
      violation  occurring  on the same day; and at least five hundred and not
      more than two  thousand  dollars  for  the  second  violation  and  each
      subsequent  violation  at  the  same place of business within a two-year
      period. For purposes of this section, any  violation  for  operating  an
      unlicensed  sidewalk cafe shall be included in determining the number of
      violations by any  subsequent  license  holder  at  the  same  place  of
      business  unless  the  subsequent license holder provides the department
      with adequate documentation demonstrating that  the  subsequent  license
      holder  acquired  the  premises  or  business  through  an  arm's length
      transaction as defined in subdivision f of this  section  and  that  the
      sale or lease was not conducted, in whole or in part, for the purpose of
      permitting the original license holder to avoid the effect of violations
      on the premises.
        b.  Any  holder  of a license found to be operating a sidewalk cafe in
      violation of this subchapter, the terms and conditions of  such  license
      and/or  a  revocable  consent  or  rules promulgated by the commissioner
      pursuant to this subchapter, shall be liable for a civil penalty  of  at
      least  two  hundred and not more than one thousand dollars for the first
      violation, at least two hundred and not more than one  thousand  dollars
      for  each  additional  violation occurring on the same day; and at least
      five hundred and not more than  two  thousand  dollars  for  the  second
      violation,  and  at  least  one thousand and not more than four thousand
      dollars for each subsequent violation at  the  same  place  of  business
      within  a  two-year period. In addition, for a third violation occurring
      on a different day and all subsequent violations occurring on  different
      days  at the same place of business within a two-year period, any person
      licensed to operate a sidewalk cafe at such place of business  shall  be
      subject  to suspension or revocation of his or her sidewalk cafe license
      for such place of business. For  purposes  of  this  section,  any  such
      violation by any license holder at a place of business shall be included
      in determining the number of violations by any subsequent license holder
      at  the  same  place  of  business  unless the subsequent license holder
      provides the department with adequate documentation  demonstrating  that
      the  subsequent license holder acquired the premises or business through
      an arm's length transaction as defined in subdivision f of this  section
      and  that  the sale or lease was not conducted, in whole or in part, for
      the purpose of permitting the  original  license  holder  to  avoid  the
      effect  of  violations on the premises. A sidewalk cafe license shall be
      suspended or revoked at the same hearing at  which  a  person  is  found
      liable  for a third violation or subsequent violations at the same place
      of business within a two-year period.
        c. A proceeding to recover any civil penalty  authorized  pursuant  to
      the provisions of subdivisions a or b of this section shall be commenced
      by  service  of  a  notice of violation which shall be returnable to the
      adjudication division of the department. Such  notice  shall  contain  a
      statement   that  any  hearing  for  a  third  violation  or  subsequent
      violations of this subchapter, the terms and  conditions  of  a  license
      and/or  a  revocable  consent  or  rules promulgated by the commissioner
      under this subchapter at the same place of business  within  a  two-year
      period  shall also constitute a hearing for the suspension or revocation
      of a license.
        d. The penalties provided by subdivisions a  and  b  of  this  section
      shall be in addition to any other penalty imposed by any other provision
      of law or rule promulgated thereunder.
    
        e.  In addition to any other enforcement procedures authorized by this
      subchapter or any other provision of law or rule, the commissioner after
      notice and a hearing shall be authorized to order that any sidewalk cafe
      and the restaurant of which it is a portion be sealed for a  period  not
      to  exceed  thirty  consecutive  days.  Such notice may be included with
      notice of any hearing for a second violation for operating an unlicensed
      sidewalk cafe as provided in subdivision a of this section, or  a  third
      violation  of  this  subchapter,  the  terms and conditions of a license
      and/or a revocable consent or rules promulgated by the commissioner,  as
      provided  in  subdivision  b  of  this  section.  For  purposes  of this
      subdivision, any such  violations  at  a  place  of  business  shall  be
      included  in  determining  the  number  of  violations by any subsequent
      license holder at the same  place  of  business  unless  the  subsequent
      license  holder  provides  the  department  with  adequate documentation
      demonstrating that the subsequent license holder acquired  the  premises
      or   business   through  an  arm's  length  transaction  as  defined  in
      subdivision f of this section  and  that  the  sale  or  lease  was  not
      conducted,  in  whole  or  in  part,  for  the purpose of permitting the
      original license holder  to  avoid  the  effect  of  violations  on  the
      premises.  The procedures provided for in subdivisions c and e through j
      of section 20-105  of  this  title  shall  apply  to  an  order  by  the
      commissioner  for sealing of a sidewalk cafe and the restaurant of which
      it is a portion.
        f. For purposes of this section, "arm's length  transaction"  means  a
      sale  of  a fee or all undivided interests in real property, or lease of
      any part thereof, or a sale  of  a  business,  in  good  faith  and  for
      valuable consideration, that reflects the fair market value of such real
      property or lease, or business, in the open market, between two informed
      and   willing   parties,  where  neither  is  under  any  compulsion  to
      participate in the transaction, unaffected  by  any  unusual  conditions
      indicating  a reasonable possibility that the sale or lease was made for
      the purpose of permitting the original licensee to avoid the  effect  of
      violations  on  the  premises.  The  following  sales or leases shall be
      presumed  not  to  be  arm's   length   transactions   unless   adequate
      documentation  is  provided demonstrating that the sale or lease was not
      conducted, in whole or in  part,  for  the  purpose  of  permitting  the
      original licensee to avoid the effect of violations on the premises:
        (1) a sale between relatives;
        (2) a sale between related companies or partners in a business; or
        (3)  a  sale  or  lease  affected by other facts or circumstances that
      would indicate that the sale or lease is entered into  for  the  primary
      purpose  of  permitting  the  original  licensee  to avoid the effect of
      violations on the premises,
        g. Notwithstanding the provisions of  subdivisions  a  or  b  of  this
      section,  the  suspension  or  revocation  of a license for a subsequent
      offense shall be waived if, upon the submission of  satisfactory  proof,
      the commissioner determines that the person or persons who committed the
      violations  which  are  the basis for the suspension or revocation acted
      against the licensee's will in committing such violations.
