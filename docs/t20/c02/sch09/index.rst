        (4) a family  member  of  a  person  who  has  a  direct  or  indirect
      beneficial  interest  in  such pedicab business has a direct or indirect
      beneficial interest in one or more  other  pedicab  businesses  and  the

      beneficial   ownership   of   a  pedicab  business,  including,  without

      intoxicated condition. A pedicab driver operating a  pedicab  which  has
      been  involved  in  an  accident  or  has  been operated in violation of
      subdivision a of this section shall be deemed to have given consent to a
      breath test and shall, at the request of a police officer, submit  to  a
      breath  test to be administered by the police officer. Failure to submit
      to such breath test shall serve as the basis for an immediate suspension
      of the pedicab driver's license, subject  to  a  prompt  post-suspension
      hearing.
        7.  operate a pedicab without a currently valid motor vehicle driver's

      authorized officer or employee of any  city  agency  directs  a  pedicab
      driver  to  move  his  or  her  pedicab from any street, avenue or other
      location, such pedicab driver shall not operate his or  her  pedicab  at
      such  street,  avenue  or  location  for  the  duration  of such exigent
      circumstances.
        1. For the purposes of this subdivision, exigent  circumstances  shall

      pedicab on any street, avenue or other location for a  specified  period
      of  time.  Such  specified period of time shall not exceed fourteen days
      except, during the period  that  commences  November  12  and  concludes
      January  7  of  the  following year, in and around the area of Manhattan
      bound on the north by Fifty-ninth Street, on the south  by  Thirty-ninth
      Street,  on  the  east  by  Lexington  Avenue  and on the west by Eighth

        g. Every affected community board  may,  at  any  time  subsequent  to
      enactment  of  this local law, conduct public hearings hereon and submit
      written recommendations to  the  department  of  consumer  affairs,  the

      by such pedicab business of the obligation to follow all  provisions  of
      state  and  local law governing the operation of a bicycle, as described
      in subdivision a of this section, and  shall  require  such  drivers  to
      provide  a copy of any summons, complaint, or notice of violation of any
      law or regulation received while operating a  pedicab  to  such  pedicab
      business,  as  well  as  a  copy  of  the  disposition  of such summons,
      complaint or notice of violation of such pedicab business,  within  five
      business  days  of  such drivers' receipt of such documents. It shall be
      unlawful for a pedicab business to fail  to  train  pedicab  drivers  to
      ensure compliance with such requirements.
        i.  A  pedicab  driver  who  is arrested, or who receives a summons or
      complaint for a traffic-related offense or other notice of violation  of

        2. Such pedicab information card shall be distributed to every pedicab
      driver licensed pursuant to section 20-257 of  this  subchapter  by  the
      department in a manner to be determined by the commissioner.
        3.  Before a passenger enters a pedicab, the driver shall provide such

        d.  Any  police  or peace officer or authorized officer or employee of
      the department, upon service on the pedicab business or  pedicab  driver

      obtain the required inspection of a pedicab or have a valid registration
      plate affixed to the pedicab pursuant  to  section  20-255  or  for  the
      failure  of  a pedicab driver to be licensed pursuant to section 20-257,
      may seize such pedicab. Any pedicab seized pursuant to this  subdivision
      shall  be  delivered  into  the  custody  of  the  department  or  other
      appropriate agency. The commissioner shall hold a hearing to  adjudicate

      imposed for a violation of subdivision a of section  20-255  or  section
      20-257 and all reasonable costs for removal and storage of such vehicle.
        f.  Where  the  commissioner,  after  adjudication of the violation of
      subdivision a of section  20-255  or  section  20-257,  finds  that  the
      pedicab business has not violated such subdivision, the department shall
      promptly  release  such  pedicab  upon  written  demand  of  the pedicab
      business.
        g. Where the commissioner, after  adjudication  of  the  violation  of
      subdivision  a of section 20-255 or section 20-257, finds a violation of
      such subdivision or such section, then (i) if the pedicab is not subject
      to forfeiture pursuant  to  paragraph  one  of  subdivision  i  of  this
      section,  the  department  shall  release  such  pedicab  to the pedicab
      business  upon  payment  of  all  applicable  civil  penalties  and  all
      reasonable  costs  of  removal  and  storage;  or (ii) if the pedicab is

      section 20-261  or  in  this  section,  a  pedicab  seized  pursuant  to
      subdivision  d  of  this  section,  and  all  rights, title and interest
      therein shall be subject to forfeiture  to  the  city  upon  notice  and
      judicial  determination  thereof  if the pedicab business that owns such
      pedicab has been found liable at least  two  times  within  a  five-year
      period  for  failing  to  have  such  pedicab  inspected  as required by
      subdivision a of section  20-255  or  for  permitting  operation  by  an
      unlicensed pedicab driver in violation of section 20-257.
        2. A forfeiture action pursuant to this subdivision shall be commenced
      by  the  filing of a summons with a notice or a summons and complaint in
      accordance with the civil practice law  and  rules.  Such  summons  with
      notice or a summons and complaint shall be served in accordance with the
      civil  practice  law  and  rules  on the pedicab business that owns such
      pedicab, and on any person listed on an application or other  record  of
      the  department  as  an  owner  of  such pedicab. A pedicab which is the
      subject of such action shall remain in the custody of the department  or
      other   appropriate  agency  pending  the  final  determination  of  the
      forfeiture action.
        3. Any person who receives notice of the institution of  a  forfeiture
      action  who  claims an interest in the pedicab subject to forfeiture may
      assert a claim in such  action  for  the  recovery  of  the  pedicab  or
      satisfaction of such owner's interest in such pedicab.
        4.  Forfeiture  pursuant  to this subdivision shall be made subject to
      the interest of a person who claims an interest in such pedicab pursuant
      to subdivision three of this subdivision, where such person  establishes
      that:  (i)  such  pedicab  was operated without having been inspected as
