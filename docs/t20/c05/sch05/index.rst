      agreement, the holder who is a party to such agreement or any agreements
      entered  into  pursuant  to  such  right  or  rights of renewal shall be
      subject to the requirements of this section at the commencement  of  the
      first renewal period.
        e.  (1)  Notwithstanding  any  other  provision of law, the department
      shall be authorized  upon  due  notice  and  hearing,  to  impose  civil
      penalties  for  the  violation  of  any  provision  of this section. The
