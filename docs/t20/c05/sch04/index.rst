Subchapter 4 - INFORMATION WITH RESPECT TO ROOM AIR CONDITIONERS
================================================================

Section 20-716

Section 20-716 ::    
        
     
        §  20-716  Legislative  findings.  The  council  hereby finds that the
      demand for electricity in the city has been steadily growing;  that  the
      supply of electricity has on frequent occasions been inadequate fully to
      meet  the  demand  therefor;  that the distribution system of the public
      utility company serving most of the city has frequently  been  disrupted
      by  heavy  loads; that major brownouts and blackouts in various sections
      of the city have frequently resulted from such conditions,  particularly
      in  the  summer; that there is no present basis for concluding that such
      conditions will not continue for  the  foreseeable  future;  that  fifty
      percent  of  the  annual  summer growth in demand for electricity in the
      city is due to air conditioning, that forty percent of the  peak  summer
      demand  for electricity in the city is attributable to air conditioning;
      that room air conditioners use a significant  part  of  the  electricity
      used  for  air  conditioning in the city; that the amount of electricity
      used by room air conditioners  of  comparable  cooling  capacity  varies
      widely;  that  most  sellers  of  room air conditioners do not presently
      advertise,  display  or   otherwise   provide   prospective   purchasers
      information  as to the amount or cost of electricity required to operate
      the various models of room air conditioners; that such  information,  if
      provided,  would  lead consumers to purchase more efficient models; that
      the growth in demand for electricity in the city, particularly in summer
      months, would thereby be slowed and there would be  an  amelioration  of
      some  of  the  conditions  which  lead  to  brownouts and blackouts. The
      council also finds that an adequate supply of electricity  is  vital  to
      the  health, safety and welfare of all persons in the city. Accordingly,
      the council further finds that, in order to conserve electricity,  there
      is  a  need  to  provide prospective purchasers of room air conditioners
      with information with respect to the efficiency and cost of operation of
      such units.
