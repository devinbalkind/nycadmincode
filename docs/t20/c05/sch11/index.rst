        (b) "Service" means a basic service  performed  by  a  retail  service
      establishment. It also means any special service not commonly offered by
      such  an  establishment  which  the  establishment offers to distinguish
      itself from its competitors.
        (c) "Retail service establishment" shall mean any establishment  which
      provides  services  to consumers at retail, and shall include but not be
      limited to the following: tailors, dry cleaners, laundries, barbers  and
      hair  salons,  nail  salons,  shoe and luggage repair shops, locksmiths,

      placed  and/or  payment  is  made,  a  list conspicuously displaying the
      current selling price of the basic services  provided.  The  list  shall
      also  disclose  factors  which may cause the price to be higher than the
      basic price, and the range of the possible additional charges when  such
      variables  pertain. (b) In the event of a special sale or promotion, the
      regular price list shall remain conspicuously visible.
        c. Notwithstanding any other law, rule or regulation, and in  addition
      to  any  other  penalties  provided  in  this  code  or  elsewhere,  the

      parts will be additional.  The  list  shall  also  state  that  warranty
      information is available on request.

        (b) The commissioner may, by regulation, permit a printed list  to  be
      substituted for a posted list, in such classes of service establishments
      in  which  the commissioner determines that it would be impracticable to
      post because the list is subject to frequent changes, provided that  the
      printed  list  is  given  to  each  customer  upon  entering the service
      establishment.
