      establishment must post, at each counter or desk  at  which  orders  are
      placed  and/or  payment  is  made,  a  list conspicuously displaying the
      current selling price of the basic services  provided.  The  list  shall

      regular price list shall remain conspicuously visible.
        c. Notwithstanding any other law, rule or regulation, and in  addition
      to  any  other  penalties  provided  in  this  code  or  elsewhere,  the
      disclosure of differing prices or fees based upon  gender  by  a  retail
      service establishment shall constitute a violation of this subchapter.
