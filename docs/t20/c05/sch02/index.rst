      units at retail. A store which is not open to the general public but  is
      reserved for use by its members shall come within the provisions of this

      qualify for membership and the store is not required  to  collect  sales
      tax  on  transactions with members. A retail store shall not include any
      store which:

      gross  sales of stock keeping items in the previous calendar year of two
      million dollars or more; or
        (c) Engages primarily in the sale  of  food  for  consumption  on  the

      rule, would be inappropriate for item pricing.
        4. "Item price" shall mean the tag, stamp or mark affixed to  a  stock
      keeping  item  which  sets  forth,  in arabic numerals, the retail price
      thereof.
        5. "Advertised price" shall mean the price of  a  stock  keeping  unit
      which  a  retail  store  has  caused  to  be  disseminated  by  means of

      television or radio advertising.
        6.  "Shelf  price"  shall mean the tag or sign placed at each point of

        8. "Price look-up function" shall mean the capability of any  checkout
      system  to  determine the retail price of a stock keeping item by way of
      the manual entry into the system of  a  code  number  assigned  to  that
      particular  stock  keeping  unit  by  the  retail store or by way of the
      checkout operator's consultation of a file maintained at  the  point  of
      sale.
        9. "Inspector" shall mean the the commissioner or his or her designee.
    
        b.  Item pricing required. Except as provided in subdivision c of this
      section, every person, firm,  partnership,  corporation  or  association
      which  sells,  offers  for sale or exposes for sale in a retail store, a
      stock keeping unit, shall disclose to the consumer  the  item  price  of
      each  stock keeping item, by causing the item price to be conspicuously,
      clearly and plainly marked, stamped, tagged or affixed thereto.
        c. Certain items exempted. The following stock keeping items need  not
      be  item  priced  as  provided in subdivision b of this section provided

      stock keeping items:
        1. Milk.

      keeping items are not otherwise item priced, are located in a segregated
      display  at  the  end  of an aisle, and the sale period, the name of the
      product and the advertised price are clearly and conspicuously posted on
      a sign at the point of display.  Failure  to  display  this  information
      shall be deemed a deceptive practice under section 20-701 of this code.
        14. Baby food packaged in jars.
        d.  Scanner accuracy. In a retail store with a laser scanning or other
      computer-assisted checkout system, an inspector shall  be  permitted  to
      compare  the disclosed retail price of any one stock keeping item within
      any stock keeping unit sold in the retail store, whether or  not  exempt
      under  subdivision  c  of this section, not to exceed five hundred stock
      keeping items at any one inspection, with the programmed computer price.
      The retail store shall  provide  such  access  to  the  computer  as  is
      necessary  for  the  inspector  to make the determination. The inspector
      shall also make note of undercharges on the inspection  report.  In  the
      event  that  the  programmed  computer  price exceeds the lowest price a
      retail store is permitted to charge  for  a  stock  keeping  item  under
      subdivision e of this section, this shall be deemed a deceptive practice
      under section 20-701 of this code.
        e. Price accuracy. No retail store shall charge a retail price for any
      stock  keeping  item,  whether or not exempt under subdivision c of this
      section, which exceeds the lower of any item, shelf, sale or  advertised
      price of such stock keeping item.
        f.  Enforcement,  penalties.  1. Upon the request of an inspector, the
      retail store representative shall afford the  inspector  access  to  the
      test  mode  of  the  checkout system in use at that retail store or to a
      comparable function of such system and to the retail  price  information
      contained in a price look-up function. No more than one inspection shall
      be conducted in any twenty-four hour period.
        2. In addition to the enforcement powers prescribed in sections 20-703
      and  20-704  of  this  code, the commissioner may, upon due notice, hold
      hearings to determine whether  violations  of  the  provisions  of  this
      section  have occurred. Such notice shall contain a concise statement of
    
      the facts constituting the alleged violation and  shall  set  forth  the
      date,  time  and  place of the hearing. Upon a finding of a violation of
      the provisions of this section, the commissioner shall be authorized  to
      impose a civil penalty as follows:
        (a)  upon  a first inspection, up to twenty-five dollars for the first
      twenty violations and up to  fifty  dollars  for  the  twenty-first  and
      successive  violations,  total  violations  not  to  exceed two thousand
      dollars.
        (b) upon a second or subsequent inspection within a two  week  period,
      up to fifty dollars for the first twenty continued violations, and up to
      one  hundred  dollars  for  the  twenty-first  and  successive continued
      violations,  total  violations  issued  not  to  exceed  eight  thousand
      dollars.
        3.  Each  failure  to  comply  with subdivision b of this section with
      respect to any one  stock  keeping  unit  shall  constitute  a  separate
      violation,  provided,  however,  that  no violation shall be found where
      less than five stock keeping items of a particular  stock  keeping  unit
      lack clearly readable item prices. Following an initial inspection, each
      inspection   that  finds  a  continuing  violation  with  respect  to  a
      particular stock keeping unit cited within the  previous  fourteen  days
      shall constitute a separate continued violation.
        g.  Rules. The commissioner may promulgate such rules as he or she may
      deem necessary  or  appropriate  to  effectuate  the  purposes  of  this
      section.

      plainly marked by a stamp, tag, label or sign at the  point  of  display

      provisions of this section shall not apply to any food store having  had
      annual  gross  sales  in  the previous tax year of less than two hundred
      fifty thousand dollars, ($250,000) unless it is a part of a  network  of
      subsidiaries,  affiliates,  or  other  member  stores,  under  direct or

      promulgate  regulations  designating  those  consumer  commodities which
      shall come within  the  scope  of  section  20-709  of  this  subchapter
      whenever  the commissioner shall find that, because of the nature, form,
      mode of packaging or other reason, such price display for that commodity
      shall be necessary and appropriate to provide  adequate  information  to
      the consumer.
        (b)  The commissioner shall promulgate regulations exempting any class

      conditions as are consistent with the policy of this subchapter whenever
      the commissioner shall find that, because of the nature of such class or
      classes  of retail establishments, compliance with section 20-709 hereof
      is unreasonably burdensome or unnecessary  for  adequate  protection  of
      consumers.
        (c)  The commissioner shall promulgate such other regulations as shall
      be necessary in his or her discretion to effectuate the purposes of this
      subchapter, including but not limited to, requirements as to the  manner
