Section 20-701 ::    
        
     
        §  20-701 Definitions. a. Deceptive trade practice. Any false, falsely
      disparaging, or misleading oral or written statement, visual description
      or other representation of any kind made in connection  with  the  sale,
      lease,  rental  or  loan  or  in  connection with the offering for sale,
      lease, rental, or  loan  of  consumer  goods  or  services,  or  in  the
      extension  of  consumer  credit  or in the collection of consumer debts,
      which has the capacity, tendency or effect of  deceiving  or  misleading
      consumers. Deceptive trade practices include but are not limited to: (1)
      representations  that  goods  or  services  have  sponsorship, approval,
      accessories, characteristics, ingredients, uses, benefits, or quantities
      that they do not have; the supplier has a sponsorship, approval, status,
      affiliation, or connection that he or  she  does  not  have;  goods  are
      original  or  new  if  they  are  deteriorated,  altered, reconditioned,
      reclaimed, or secondhand; or, goods or  services  are  of  a  particular
      standard,  quality,  grade,  style or model, if they are of another; (2)
      the use,  in  any  oral  or  written  representation,  of  exaggeration,
      innuendo  or  ambiguity  as  to  a  material  fact or failure to state a
      material fact if such use deceives or tends to deceive; (3)  disparaging
      the  goods,  services,  or  business  of  another by false or misleading
      representations of material facts; (4) offering goods or  services  with
      intent  not to sell them as offered; (5) offering goods or services with
      intent not to supply reasonable expectable  public  demand,  unless  the
      offer  discloses  to  limitation  of  quantity;  and (6) making false or
      misleading representations of fact concerning the reasons for, existence
      of, or amounts of price reductions, or price in comparison to prices  of
      competitors  or  one's  own  price at a past or future time; (7) stating
      that a  consumer  transaction  involves  consumer  rights,  remedies  or
      obligations  that  it  does  not  involve;  (8)  stating  that services,
      replacements or repairs are needed if they  are  not;  and  (9)  falsely
      stating the reasons for offering or supplying goods or services at scale
      discount prices.
        b.  Unconscionable  trade  practice. Any act or practice in connection
      with the sale, lease, rental or loan or in connection with the  offering
      for sale, lease, rental or loan of any consumer goods or services, or in
      the extension of consumer credit, or in the collection of consumer debts
      which  unfairly  takes  advantage  of  the  lack  of knowledge, ability,
      experience or capacity of a consumer; or results in  a  gross  disparity
      between  the  value  received  by  a consumer and the price paid, to the
      consumer's detriment; provided that no act or practice shall  be  deemed
      unconscionable  under this subchapter unless declared unconscionable and
      described with reasonable particularity in a local law, or in a rule  or
      regulation  promulgated  by the commissioner. In promulgating such rules
      and regulations the commissioner shall consider among other factors: (1)
      knowledge by merchants engaging in the act or practice of the  inability
      of  consumers to receive properly anticipated benefits from the goods or
      services involved; (2) gross disparity between the  price  of  goods  or
      services and their value measured by the price at which similar goods or
      services  are readily obtained by other consumers; (3) the fact that the
      acts or  practices  may  enable  merchants  to  take  advantage  of  the
      inability  of  consumers reasonably to protect their interests by reason
      of physical or mental infirmities, illiteracy or inability to understand
      the language of the  agreement,  ignorance  or  lack  of  education,  or
      similar  factors;  (4)  the  degree  to  which  terms of the transaction
      require consumers to waive legal rights; (5) the degree to  which  terms
      of  the  transaction  require  consumers to jeopardize money or property
      beyond the money or property immediately at issue  in  the  transaction;
      and  (6)  definitions  of  unconscionability  in  statutes, regulations,
    
      rulings and decisions of legislative, or judicial bodies in  this  state
      or elsewhere.
        c.  Consumer  goods,  services,  credit  and debts. As used in section
      20-700 of this subchapter and subdivisions a  and  b  of  this  section,
      goods,  services,  credit  and  debts  which are primarily for personal,
      household or family purposes.
        d. Consumer. A purchaser or lessee or prospective purchaser or  lessee
      of  the  consumer  goods  or  services  or  consumer credit, including a
      co-obligor or surety.
        e. Merchant. A seller, lessor, or creditor or  any  other  person  who
      makes  available  either  directly  or  indirectly,  goods,  services or
      credit,  to   consumers.   "Merchant"   shall   include   manufacturers,
      wholesalers  and  others  who  are  responsible  for any act or practice
      prohibited by this subchapter.

        §  20-702  Regulations.  The  commissioner  may  adopt  such rules and
      regulations as may be necessary  to  effectuate  the  purposes  of  this
      subchapter,   including   regulations  defining  specific  deceptive  or
      unconscionable  trade  practices.  Such  rules   and   regulations   may
      supplement but shall not be inconsistent with the rules, regulations and
      decisions  of  the  federal  trade  commission and the federal courts in
      interpreting the provisions of section five (a) (1), the  federal  trade
      commission  act  15  U.S.C.  §45 (a) (1), or the decisions of the courts
      interpreting section three hundred fifty of the general business law and
      section 2-302 of the uniform commercial code.
    
    
    
    
    
    
    

Section 20-703
--------------

Section 20-703 ::    
        
     
        §  20-703  Enforcement.  a.  The  violation  of  any provision of this
      subchapter or of any rule or regulation promulgated thereunder, shall be
      punishable upon proof thereof, by the payment of a civil penalty in  the
      sum of fifty dollars to three hundred and fifty dollars, to be recovered
      in a civil action.
        b. The knowing violation of any provision of this subchapter or of any
      rule  or  regulation  promulgated  thereunder,  shall be punishable upon
      conviction thereof, by the payment of a civil penalty in the sum of five
      hundred dollars, or as a violation for which a fine in the sum  of  five
      hundred dollars shall be imposed, or both.
        c.  Upon  a  finding  by  the  commissioner  of  repeated, multiple or
      persistent violation of any provision of this subchapter or of any  rule
      or   regulation   promulgated   thereunder,  the  city  may,  except  as
      hereinafter provided,  bring  an  action  to  compel  the  defendant  or
      defendants  in such action to pay in court all monies, property or other
      things, or proceeds thereof, received as a result of such violations; to
      direct that the  amount  of  money  or  the  property  or  other  things
      recovered  be  paid  into an account established pursuant to section two
      thousand six hundred one of the civil practice law and rules from  which
      shall  be  paid  over  to any and all persons who purchased the goods or
      services during the period of violation such sum as was paid by them  in
      a transaction involving the prohibited acts or practices, plus any costs
      incurred  by  such  claimants  in  making and pursuing their complaints;
      provided that if such claims exceed the sum recovered into the  account,
      the awards to consumers shall be prorated according to the value of each
      claim proved; to direct the defendant or defendants, upon conviction, to
      pay  to  the  city the costs, and disbursements of the action and pay to
      the city for the use of  the  commissioner  the  costs  of  his  or  her
      investigation  leading  to  the  judgment;  or  if  not  recovered  from
      defendants, such costs are to be deducted by the  city  from  the  grand
      recovery  before  distribution  to the consumers; and to direct that any
      money, property, or other things in the account  and  unclaimed  by  any
      persons  with  such claims within one year from creation of the account,
      be paid to the city, to be used by the commissioner for further consumer
      law enforcement activities. Consumers making claims against  an  account
      established pursuant to this subdivision shall prove their claims to the
      commissioner  in  a  manner and subject to procedures established by the
      commissioner for that purpose. The procedures established in  each  case
      for  proving  claims  shall not be employed until approved by the court,
      which shall also establish by order  the  minimum  means  by  which  the
      commissioner  shall  notify  potential  claimants of the creation of the
      account. Restitution pursuant to a judgment  in  an  action  under  this
      subdivision  shall  bar,  pro  tanto, the recovery of any damages in any
      other action against the same defendant or defendants on account of  the
      same acts or practices which were the basis for such judgment, up to the
      time  of  the  judgment, by any person to whom such restitution is made.
      Restitution under this  subdivision  shall  not  apply  to  transactions
      entered  into more than five years prior to commencement of an action by
      the commissioner. Before instituting an action under  this  subdivision,
      the  commissioner shall give the prospective defendant written notice of
      the possible action, and an opportunity to demonstrate in writing within
      five days, that no repeated, multiple,  or  persistent  violations  have
      occurred.
        d.  Whenever  any  person  has  engaged in any acts or practices which
      constitute violations of any provision of this subchapter or of any rule
      or regulation promulgated thereunder, the city may make  application  to
      the  supreme court for an order enjoining such acts or practices and for
    
      an order granting  a  temporary  or  permanent  injunction,  restraining
      order, or other order enjoining such acts or practices.
        e.  To  establish  a cause of action under this section it need not be
      shown that consumers are being or were actually injured.
    
    
    
    
    
    
    

Section 20-704
--------------

Section 20-704 ::    
        
     
        §  20-704  Settlements.  a.  In  lieu  of instituting or continuing an
      action pursuant to this subchapter, the commissioner may accept  written
      assurance  of discontinuance of any act or practice in violation of this
      subchapter from the person or persons who have engaged in such  acts  or
      practices.  Such  assurance  may  include  a  stipulation  for voluntary
      payment  by  the  violator  of  the  costs  of  investigation   by   the
      commissioner  and  may also include a stipulation for the restitution by
      the violator to consumers, of money, property or other  things  received
      from  them  in connection with a violation of this subchapter, including
      money necessarily expended in  the  course  of  making  and  pursuing  a
      complaint to the commissioner. All settlements shall be made a matter of
      public  record.  If  such stipulation applies to consumers who have been
      affected by the violator's practices but have not yet complained to  the
      commissioner,  the  assurance must be approved by the court, which shall
      direct the minimum means by which potential claimants shall be  notified
      of  the  stipulation. A consumer need not accept restitution pursuant to
      such a stipulation; his or her acceptance  shall  bar  recovery  of  any
      other  damages  in  any  action  by  him or her against the defendant or
      defendants on account of the same acts or practices.
        b. Violation of an assurance entered into  pursuant  to  this  section
      shall  be treated as a violation of this subchapter and shall be subject
      to all the penalties provided therefor.

      subchapter shall apply to any television or radio  broadcasting  station
      or  to  any publisher or printer of a newspaper, magazine, or other form
      of printed  advertising,  who  broadcasts,  publishes,  or  prints  such
      advertisement, except insofar as said station or publisher or printer is
      guilty  of  deception  on  the  sale  or  offering  for  sale of its own
      services. This subchapter  shall  not  apply  to  advertising  agencies,
      provided they are acting on information provided by their clients.

      of  the  federal  trade commission and the courts interpreting 15 U.S.C.
      Sec 45 (a) (1), but the  provisions  of  this  subchapter  shall  in  no
      instance  be  interpreted  in  a  manner  inconsistent  with  the rules,
      regulations and decisions of the federal trade commission and the courts
      interpreting 15 U.S.C. § 45 (a) (1).
