        §28-305.1 Retaining walls, partition fences and other site structures.
      In  addition to the requirements set forth in chapter 33 of the New York
      city building code, the responsibility  for  maintaining  and  repairing
      retaining  walls, partition fences and other site structures shall be in
      accordance with sections 28-305.1.1, 305.1.2 and 305.4.

------------------

Section 28-305.1.1 ::    
        
     
        §28-305.1.1  Structures located on the lot line of adjacent properties
      and partially on both properties.  The  owners  of  adjacent  properties
      shall  be  responsible  jointly for the proper maintenance and repair of
      retaining walls, partition fences and other site structures, or portions
      thereof, that are located along the common lot line and  on  both  their
      properties; and each such owner shall be responsible for one-half of the
      costs  of  maintaining  and  repairing  such fences, retaining walls and
      other site structures, or such portions thereof. Where an  owner  elects
      to  remove  temporarily  a  retaining  wall  or  partition fence that is
      required to support a grade differential between the two properties,  or
      for  any other reason is required by this code, such owner shall protect
      the adjacent property, shall not impair its safe use, and shall  replace
      the retaining wall or partition fence at his or her own cost.

Section 28-305.1.2 ::    
        
     
        §28-305.1.2  Structures  located  entirely on one property. Where such
      retaining walls, partition fences or other site structures, or  portions
      thereof,  are  located  entirely  on  one  property,  the  owner of such
      property shall be wholly responsible  for  the  proper  maintenance  and
      repair  of  the retaining wall, partition fence or other site structure.
      If, however, the proper maintenance  and/or  repair  of  such  retaining
      wall,  partition  fence  or other site structures requires access to the
      adjoining property, the owner of such  adjoining  property  shall  allow
      such access.

      set  his  or  her  grade  either  higher  or  lower than the grade of an
      adjoining property  at  the  property  line,  such  owner  shall  erect,
      maintain and repair a retaining wall of sufficient height, structure and
      foundation to support such grade differential, and with proper drainage,
      in  accordance  with  this  code, such that the adjacent property is not
      impacted, and shall do so at the sole expense of such owner and entirely
      on the property of such owner without access to the adjoining property.

      enforcing   by   private  action  special  agreements  with  respect  to
      maintenance or repair of retaining walls,  partition  fences  and  other
      site structures or access to adjoining property for such purpose.
