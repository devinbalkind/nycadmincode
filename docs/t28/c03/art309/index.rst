      September  first  thereafter for city buildings, no later than September

      department of finance, and no later than September 1, 2013, and no later
      than every  September  first  thereafter  for  covered  buildings  whose
      primary  use is residential, as determined by the department of finance.
      Such information shall include, but need not  be  limited  to:  (i)  the
      energy  utilization  index,  (ii)  the  water use per gross square foot,
      (iii) where available, a rating that compares the energy and  water  use
      of  the  building to that of similar buildings, and (iv) a comparison of
      data across calendar years for any years such building was  benchmarked.
      Information  generated  by  the  benchmarking tool for the 2009 calendar
      year for  city  buildings,  for  the  2010  calendar  year  for  covered
      buildings,  and  for  the 2011 calendar year for covered buildings whose
      primary use is residential, as determined by the department of  finance,

      building that contains a data center, television studio, and/or  trading
      floor  that  together  exceed ten percent of the gross square footage of
      any such building shall not be disclosed until the office  of  long-term
      planning  and  sustainability  determines that the benchmarking tool can
      make adequate adjustments  for  such  facilities.  When  the  office  of
      long-term  planning  and sustainability determines that the benchmarking
      tool can make such adjustments, it shall report  such  determination  to
      the  mayor and the speaker of the city council. Until such determination
      is made, the office  of  long-term  planning  and  sustainability  shall
      report  biennially to the mayor and the speaker of the city council that
      the benchmarking tool is unable to make such adjustments.

      administration  and  enforcement  of  this  article  and  analyzing data
      obtained  from  the  benchmarking  tool.  Such  report   shall   contain
      information  regarding: (i) the energy and water efficiency of buildings
      in the city, (ii) the accuracy of benchmarked data and whether there  is
      a  need  to  train  and/or  certify  individuals  who  benchmark,  (iii)
      compliance  with  the   requirements   of   this   article,   (iv)   any
      administrative  and  legislative  recommendations  for strengthening the
      administration and enforcement of this article, (v) the effectiveness of
      the benchmarking tool  in  accounting  for  New  York  city  conditions,
      including,  but  not limited to, high density occupancies, use of steam,
      large building size, and specific high-energy uses such as data centers,
      television studios, and trading floors, and (vi) such other  information

      with  this article. The director of the office of long-term planning and
      sustainability may lift all or  part  of  any  such  suspension  upon  a
      written  finding  that such deficiency has been corrected. The office of
      long-term planning and sustainability shall notify the  speaker  of  the
      city  council, the department, the department of citywide administrative
