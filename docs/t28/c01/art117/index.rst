      unlawful to use or occupy any building or space as a place  of  assembly
      without  a  certificate  of  operation  issued  by  the commissioner. An
      application for  a  certificate  of  operation  shall  be  made  to  the
      department   in  such  form  and  containing  such  information  as  the
      commissioner shall provide. The department shall inspect every place  of
      assembly  space prior to the issuance of a certificate of operation. The
      commissioner shall not issue  a  certificate  of  operation  unless  the
      department  determines  that  the  space  conforms  substantially to the
      approved construction documents and to the provisions of this  code  and
      that  the certificate of occupancy authorizes such use. A certificate of
      operation shall not be issued to a place of assembly  providing  seating
      or  other  moveable  furnishings unless the commissioner approves a plan
      conforming to this code and the rules of  the  department.  Seating  and
      other  moveable  furnishings  shall  be  maintained  at all times during
      occupancy in accordance with the approved plan. Any  amendment  of  such
      plan shall be subject to the prior approval of the commissioner.
