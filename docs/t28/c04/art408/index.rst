Section 28-408.3.1
------------------

Section 28-408.3.1 ::    
        
     
        §28-408.3.1  Experience.  All  applicants for a master plumber license
      shall submit satisfactory proof establishing that the applicant:
        1. Has had at least seven years total experience within the  10  years
      prior  to application in the design and installation of plumbing systems
      under the direct and continuing supervision of a licensed master plumber
      in the United States, with at least two years of such  experience  as  a
      registered  journeyman  plumber  in  accordance  with  the provisions of
      article 409, except that during the three  years  immediately  following
      the  effective  date of this code there shall be no requirement for such
      registered journeyman plumber experience;
        2. Has received a bachelor's  degree  in  engineering  or  appropriate
      engineering  technology from an accredited college or university and has
      had at least five years total experience within the seven years prior to
      application in the design and installation of plumbing systems under the
      direct and continuing supervision of a licensed master  plumber  in  the
      United  States,  where at least two years of such experience were in New
      York city;
        3. Is an architect or engineer with at least three years of experience
      within  the  five  years  prior  to  application  in  the   design   and
      installation  of  plumbing  systems  under  the  direct  and  continuing
      supervision of a licensed master plumber in the United States, where  at
      least one year of such experience was in New York city; or
        4.  Has  had at least seven years total experience within the 10 years
      prior to application, with at least two years of such experience working
      in the design and installation of plumbing systems under the direct  and
      continuing  supervision  of  a  licensed  master  plumber  in the United
      States. The balance of such  required  experience  may  be  obtained  by
      performing maintenance, replacement and repair plumbing work on existing
      buildings  while  in  the  employ  of a city agency under the direct and
      continuing supervision of a licensed master plumber supervisor  employed
      by  the  city  agency. Three years after the effective date of this code
      the two years experience in the  design  and  installation  of  plumbing
      systems set forth above may only be satisfied by working as a registered
      journeyman plumber.
        5.  An  employee  of a government agency, private inspection agency or
      other entity, acceptable to the  commissioner,  whose  duties  primarily
      involve the inspection of plumbing work for compliance with the New York
      city  plumbing  code  and/or  other  laws  relating to the installation,
      alteration or repair of plumbing systems shall be  credited  with  fifty
      percent  (50%)  of  the  number  of  years  that  he  or  she  has  been
      satisfactorily employed in such duties within the ten (10)  year  period
      prior  to application, which, however, in no event, shall exceed two and
      one-half (2 1/2) years credit of satisfactory experience. The balance of
      the required seven years must have  been  obtained  by  working  in  the
      design  and  installation  of  plumbing  systems  under  the  direct and
      continuing supervision of a licensed master plumber in the United States
      except that the requirement of paragraph 1 of  this  section  28-408.3.1
      that  an  applicant's  working  experience must have been within the ten
      (10) year period prior to application shall not apply to such balance of
      the work experience required pursuant to this paragraph.
