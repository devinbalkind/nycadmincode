      repair of fire suppression work  on  existing  buildings  while  in  the
      employ of a city agency under the direct and continuing supervision of a

      the  direct  and  continuing  supervision of a licensed fire suppression
      piping, contractor in the United States except that the  requirement  of
      paragraph  1  of  this  section  28-410.4.1  that an applicant's working
      experience must have been within the  ten  (10)  year  period  prior  to
      application  shall  not  apply  to  such  balance of the work experience
