      satisfactory evidence of his  or  her  qualifications,  and  shall  have
      satisfactorily  passed  all  required  examinations  and investigations,
      provided that no license or certificate of competence  shall  be  issued

      license or certificate of competence as may be set forth in this chapter

      but not more than 60 calendar days prior to the expiration date of same.
      The  failure of an individual to renew his or her license or certificate

      and/or seal issued by the department shall  immediately  surrender  such
      plate  and/or  seal  to  the  department.  A person who fails to renew a
      license or certificate of competence within the time period set forth in

      pursuant  to section 28-401.13. The department may, following notice and
      an opportunity to be heard, refuse to renew a license or certificate  of
      competence  on  any grounds on the basis of which it could deny, suspend
      or revoke such license.

      certificate of competence, within one year of the date of its expiration
      without  examination  but  subject  to applicable late and reinstatement
      fees. Thereafter, and up to five years after the date of expiration, the
      commissioner may reinstate the  license  or  certificate  of  competence
      without   examination   upon   the   applicant's  demonstration  to  the
      commissioner's satisfaction of continued competence  in  the  respective
      trade   and   satisfaction   of   any  applicable  continuing  education
      requirements. A license  or  certificate  of  competence  shall  not  be
