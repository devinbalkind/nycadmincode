Section 28-504.4
----------------

Section 28-504.4 ::    
        
     
        § 28-504.4 Exceptions. Bicycle access need not be provided pursuant to
      this article if an owner, lessee, manager or other person who controls a
      building applies to the commissioner of transportation for an exception,
      on  a  form provided by the department of transportation and sent to the
      department  of  transportation  by  certified   mail,   return   receipt
      requested,  within  fifteen  days  of receipt of a request for a bicycle
      access plan, and certifies that either:
        1. The building's freight  elevator  is  not  available  for  the  use
      described  in  this article because unique circumstances exist involving
      substantial safety risks directly related to the use of  such  elevator.
      Such  application  shall  include  the  reasons  for  such assertion and
      supporting documentation.
        or
        2.  There  is  sufficient  secure  alternate  covered  off-street   or
      sufficient  secure alternate indoor no-cost bicycle parking available on
      the premises or  within  three  blocks  or  seven  hundred  fifty  feet,
      whichever  is  less,  of  such  building  to  accommodate all tenants or
      subtenants of such building requesting bicycle access. Such  application
      shall  include  supporting  documentation  for such assertion, including
      proof that such alternate off-street or indoor parking is  available  to
      or  under the control of such owner, lessee, manager or other person who
      controls the building.
      If an exception is sought for the reasons set forth in  subdivision  one
      of  this  section,  the  department  shall  conduct an inspection of the
      building and  freight  elevator  and  shall  thereafter  issue  a  final
      determination  as  to  whether to grant an exception. If an exception is
      sought for the reasons set forth in subdivision two of this section, the
      department, in consultation with the department of transportation, shall
      thereafter  conduct  an  inspection  of  the  secure  alternate  covered
      off-street  or  secure indoor no-cost bicycle parking and the department
      of transportation shall thereafter issue a  final  determination  as  to
      whether to grant an exception. In either event, a letter of exception or
      denial shall be sent by certified mail, return receipt requested, to the
      owner,  lessee,  manager, or other person in control of the building. If
      the exception is denied, a bicycle access plan shall  be  posted  within
      twenty  days  of receipt of such determination. Failure to timely post a
      bicycle access plan shall be cause for the issuance of a violation.
