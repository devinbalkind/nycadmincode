        1. In the case of a sign which is accessory to a principal use  within
      the  meaning of section 12-10 of the zoning resolution, there has been a
      discontinuance of the operation of the principal use to which such  sign
      is  accessory,  or  in  the  event  the  sign  is  no longer in the same
