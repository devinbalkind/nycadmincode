Section 28-204.1 ::    
        
     
        §28-204.1 General. Any person who shall violate or fail to comply with
      any  of  the provisions of this code, the 1968 building code, the zoning
      resolution or other laws or rules enforced by the department or with any
      order issued pursuant thereto shall be liable for a civil  penalty  that
      may be recovered in a proceeding before the environmental control board.
      Such  proceeding  shall  be  commenced  by  the  service  of a notice of
      violation returnable before the board. Such notice of violation  may  be
      issued  by  employees  of  the  department  or  of  other  city agencies
      designated by the commissioner and may be served by such employees or by
      a licensed process server.

Section 28-204.2 ::    
        
     
        §28-204.2  Order  to certify correction. Each such notice of violation
      shall contain an order of the commissioner directing the  respondent  to
      correct  the  condition  constituting the violation and to file with the
      department electronically or in such other manner as the department  may
      authorize by rule a certification that the condition has been corrected.
      Unless  otherwise  provided  by  rule,  such  order  shall  require that
      violations classified as major or lesser be  corrected  within  30  days
      from  the  date  of the order, that violations classified as immediately
      hazardous be corrected forthwith. Such order  shall  also  require  that
      certification of the correction of the violation shall be filed with the
      department  in a manner and form and within such period of time as shall
      be  established  by  the  department.  In  any  proceeding  before   the
      environmental  control  board,  no  civil penalty shall be imposed for a
      lesser violation if the  respondent  complies  with  the  commissioner's
      order  to  correct and to certify correction of the violation within the
      applicable time period. However, such violation may serve as a predicate
      for purposes of assessing aggravating factors attributable  to  multiple
      offenses.

      control  board,  if  the board finds that the commissioner has failed to
      prove the violation charged,  the  order  requiring  the  respondent  to
      correct  the  condition  constituting  the  violation  shall  be  deemed
      dismissed.

      comply  with  an  order  of  the commissioner issued pursuant to section
      28-204.2 to correct and to certify correction of a violation within  the
      applicable  time  period  shall  be  a  violation of this code for which
      penalties may be imposed in addition to the penalties  that  may  be  or
      have  been  imposed  for  the  violation referred to in such order. Upon
      application, for good cause, the commissioner may extend  the  time  for
      filing  the certification of correction of a violation, but not for more

      purposes of this section 28-204.5, if the  environmental  control  board
      finds  that  a  certification  of  correction  filed pursuant to section
      28-204.2 contained material false statements relating to the  correction
      of  a violation, such certification of correction shall be null and void
      and the penalties set forth in  this  code  for  the  violation  may  be
      imposed  as  if  such  false  certification  had not been filed with and
      accepted by the department. It shall be an affirmative defense that  the
