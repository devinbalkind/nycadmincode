        §24-803  Reduction  of  greenhouse  gas  emissions  that contribute to
      global warming. a. (1) Reduction of emissions citywide. There shall  be,
      at minimum, a thirty percent reduction in citywide emissions by calendar
      year  2030,  relative  to  such emissions for the base year for citywide
      emissions.
        (2)  The  emissions  reduction  required  by  paragraph  one  of  this
      subdivision  shall be achieved through the applicable policies, programs
      and actions included in PlaNYC, and any  additional  policies,  programs
      and actions to reduce greenhouse gas emissions that contribute to global
      warming.  If  the office determines that such emissions reduction is not
      feasible despite the best efforts of city government, such office  shall
      report  such findings and make recommendations with respect to policies,
      programs and actions that may be undertaken to achieve such reductions.
        b. Reduction of emissions from city government operations.  (1)  There
      shall  be,  at  minimum,  a  thirty percent reduction in city government
      emissions by calendar year 2017, relative to such emissions for the base
      year for city government emissions.
        (2)  The  emissions  reduction  required  by  paragraph  one  of  this
      subdivision  shall be achieved through the applicable policies, programs
      and actions included in PlaNYC, and any  additional  policies,  programs
      and actions to reduce greenhouse gas emissions that contribute to global
      warming.  If  the office determines that such emissions reduction is not
      feasible despite the best efforts of city government, such office  shall
      report  such findings and make recommendations with respect to policies,
      programs and actions that may be undertaken to achieve such reductions.
        c. Carbon dioxide equivalent emission inventories. (1) No  later  than
      September 17, 2008, and no later than every September 17 thereafter, the
      office  shall complete and post on its website an inventory and analysis
      of citywide emissions measured in  carbon  dioxide  equivalent  for  the
      previous  calendar  year,  and  shall calculate the percentage change in
      citywide emissions  measured  in  carbon  dioxide  equivalent  for  such
      calendar year, relative to such emissions for the base year for citywide
      emissions.
        (2)  No  later  than  September  17,  2008,  and  no  later than every
      September 17 thereafter, the office  shall  complete  and  post  on  its
      website  an inventory and analysis of city government emissions measured
      in carbon dioxide equivalent for the fiscal year ending in the  previous
      calendar  year,  and  shall  calculate  the  percentage  change  in city
      government emissions measured in  carbon  dioxide  equivalent  for  such
      calendar  year,  relative  to  such emissions for the base year for city
      government emissions.
        d. Voluntary global warming emissions reduction program. The effort to
      reduce citywide emissions set forth in subdivision  a  of  this  section
      shall  include,  but not be limited to, voluntary programs developed and
      implemented no later than March 1, 2009, that encourage private entities
      operating within the city of New York to commit to  reducing  their  own
      greenhouse  gas  emissions measured in carbon dioxide equivalent to help
      facilitate the citywide emissions reduction effort.
    
    
    
    
    
    
    

Section 24-804
--------------

Section 24-804 ::    
        
     
        §  24-804  Education  and outreach. a. No later than July 1, 2009, the
      office shall develop and implement programs  for  public  education  and
      outreach  regarding  global  warming and the reduction of greenhouse gas
      emissions by residents, businesses, public and  private  elementary  and
      secondary  schools, and other entities within the city of New York. Such
      program shall include,  but  not  be  limited  to,  awareness  campaigns
      tailored  to  specific  sectors  of the public, through which the office
      shall develop and  disseminate  information  regarding  global  warming,
      including  its  potential  impacts  on  the  city  of New York, and best
      practices to reduce energy consumption and greenhouse gas emissions.
        b. The New York city renewable energy  portal.  1.  The  office  shall
      develop  and  administer an interactive website called the New York city
      renewable energy portal. A link to the renewable energy portal shall  be
      prominently  displayed on the website of the department of buildings and
      any other city agency website that pertains  to  sustainable  growth  or
      environmental policy.
        2.  The purpose of the renewable energy portal shall be to effectively
      inform the public  about  the  feasibility  and  economic  viability  of
      installing  renewable energy systems in the city of New York. Content on
      the website shall be written in plain  language  whenever  possible  and
      shall  include, but not be limited to, information on solar photovoltaic
      panels, solar water heaters, geothermal heat pumps,  and  leadership  in
      energy  and environmental design (LEED) certification. Links featured on
      the website shall be verified on a quarterly basis.
        3. The renewable energy portal shall have or link to,  to  the  extent
      they  are  available,  programs  that  allow  the  user to calculate the
      estimated costs and benefits  of  renewable  energy  systems,  lists  of
      financial  incentives available at the federal, state, and local levels,
      and tools and guidelines  to  evaluate  the  feasibility  of  installing
      renewable energy technologies.
        4. The renewable energy portal shall assist users in determining which
      city,  state,  and  federal agencies, if any, must approve a prospective
      installation of renewable energy systems. The  renewable  energy  portal
      shall  link  to  the  website of any city, state, or federal agency that
      must be contacted in  connection  with  the  installation  of  renewable
      energy  systems,  and  may also link to any forms, if they are available
      online, that such  agency  may  require  of  prospective  installers  of
      renewable energy systems.
        5.  The renewable energy portal shall list the qualifications required
      for any contractor to perform installations of renewable energy  systems
      within the city of New York.
        6.  Nothing  within  this  section  shall  be  construed  to limit the
      authority of the  office  to  create  additional  resources  within  the
      renewable energy portal.
