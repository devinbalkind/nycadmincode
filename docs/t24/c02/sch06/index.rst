      Such removal may be accomplished by utilizing any existing city-operated
      tow-program, rotation tow program established pursuant to section 20-519

      decision within two  business  days  following  the  conclusion  of  the
      hearing.  If  it  is determined that there was no basis for removal of a
      vehicle pursuant to this section, the owner of such vehicle may  recover
      from the city any amounts paid by such owner for towing and storage.

      vehicle  shall be lawful if designed and used solely as an audible motor

      audible warning may consist of a gong or bell sound.
        (b)  No  person  shall  operate  or permit to be operated an emergency
      signal device installed on an authorized  emergency  vehicle  that  when
      operated  at  the  maximum  level  creates a sound level in excess of 90
      dB(A) when measured at a distance of fifty feet from the center  of  the
      forward  face  of such vehicle. Within one year after the effective date
      of this subdivision and every two  years  thereafter,  emergency  signal
      devices  installed  on authorized emergency vehicles shall be tested and
      certification shall be submitted, in a form approved by the  department,
      that  such  devices  meet the standard set forth in this subdivision for
      operation at maximum level. Notwithstanding  the  foregoing  provisions,
      where compliance with the provisions of this subdivision would create an
      undue hardship, the owner or operator of an authorized emergency vehicle
      may  submit  a  plan to the commissioner for emergency signal devices to
      meet the standard set forth in this subdivision within two  years  after
