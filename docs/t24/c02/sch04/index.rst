Section 24-220 ::    
        
     
        ยง 24-220  Noise mitigation plan. (a) Each person, corporation or other
      business entity performing construction work in the city shall adopt and
      implement  a  noise  mitigation  plan  for  each  construction  site  in
      accordance  with  the  provisions  of  this  subchapter  and  such rules
      whenever any one or more  of  the  construction  devices  or  activities
      listed  above  or in the department's rules are employed or performed at
      the site.
        (b)  Such  plan  shall  be  adopted  prior  to  the  commencement   of
      construction  at the site or, with respect to emergency work, as defined
      in the department's rules, within three days thereafter, and shall apply
      to all work at the site throughout the construction  process.  The  plan
      shall  provide  in  detail  the  noise  mitigation  strategies, methods,
      procedures and technology, as prescribed in the rules of the  department
      or  specifically approved by the commissioner in accordance with section
      24-221 of this code, for each device or activity employed  or  performed
      at  the  site.  Each  permit  holder  or  other person in charge of such
      construction site will be accountable for compliance with such rules and
      shall ensure that each person performing construction work at  the  site
      shall  be  aware of the plan and shall be responsible for complying with
      those provisions that affect his or her work.
        (c) A copy of the plan shall be kept  at  the  construction  site  and
      shall  be  made  available  for  inspection  upon the request of persons
      authorized to enforce the provisions of this code.
        (d)  The  plan  shall  be  amended  whenever  additional  devices   or
      activities  unforeseen  at the commencement of construction are employed
      at the site or at the direction of the commissioner in  accordance  with
      section 24-223 of this subchapter.
        (e)  A plan need not be filed with or approved by the department prior
      to the commencement of construction if it conforms in  all  respects  to
      the  rules  of  the  department with respect to construction devices and
      activities employed or performed at the construction site. A  plan  that
      deviates  in  any  respect  from  such  rules  or  an  alternative noise
      mitigation plan required to be certified in  conjunction  with  a  undue
      hardship  application  pursuant  to  paragraph (5) of subdivision (e) of
      section  24-223  shall  be  subject  to  the  prior  approval   of   the
      commissioner in accordance with section 24-221 of this code.
        (f)  This  section  shall not apply to construction work in connection
      with the  alteration  or  repair  of  an  existing  one  or  two  family
      owner-occupied  dwelling  classified in occupancy group J-3 or a convent
      or rectory.
    
    
    
    
    
    
    

Section 24-221
--------------

Section 24-221 ::    
        
     
        ยง  24-221 Alternative noise mitigation plan. (a) Upon application, the
      commissioner may approve an alternative  noise  mitigation  plan  for  a
      particular  construction  site that deviates from strict compliance with
      the noise mitigation rules. Application for approval of such plan  shall
      be  submitted  to the department at least ten business days prior to the
      commencement of construction or as soon as practicable but no later than
      24 hours prior to the commencement of construction in a form and  manner
      and  accompanied  by  such information and documentation as shall be set
      forth in the rules of the department. The commissioner may approve  such
      alternative noise mitigation plan if he or she finds that:
        (1)  strict  compliance  with  the noise mitigation rules would not be
      possible or would create an undue hardship because of  the  location  or
      unique  characteristics  of  the  site or of the construction devices or
      activities to be employed or performed at the site; and
        (2) the alternative noise mitigation strategies,  methods,  procedures
      or  equipment  proposed are consistent with the purposes and policies of
      this code.
        (b)  Notwithstanding  the  foregoing  provisions,  with   respect   to
      construction  sites where construction is performed pursuant to a permit
      issued prior to the effective date of this section or  in  the  case  of
      construction  by  or  on  behalf  of a city agency where construction is
      performed under a contract bid out prior to the effective date  of  this
      section,  application  for  approval  of an alternative noise mitigation
      plan may be submitted within 60 days after the effective  date  of  this
      section. The commissioner may approve such plan if he or she finds that:
        (1)  strict  compliance  with  the noise mitigation rules would not be
      possible or would create an undue hardship because of  the  location  or
      unique  characteristics  of  the  site or of the construction devices or
      activities employed or performed at the site, or
        (2) strict compliance with such rules would be unreasonable or  unduly
      burdensome with respect to construction work that is imminent or ongoing
      on the effective date of this section, or
        (3)  with respect to city construction projects, the implementation of
      contract modifications to achieve  strict  compliance  with  such  rules
      would  result  in  unreasonable delay and/or increased expenditure for a
      necessary public improvement, and
        (4) the alternative noise mitigation strategies,  methods,  procedures
      or  equipment  proposed are consistent with the purposes and policies of
      this code.
        (c) Where the commissioner rejects  an  alternative  noise  mitigation
      plan,  an  applicant  may  appeal  such rejection in accordance with the
      rules of the department. An alternative plan  shall  not  be  in  effect
      unless  and  until  it has been approved by the commissioner except that
      where a timely alternative plan has been filed with the commissioner for
      approval, a construction site in compliance with such  alternative  plan
      shall  be  deemed to be in compliance with this section unless and until
      such plan is rejected by the commissioner  and  for  a  reasonable  time
      thereafter as determined by the commissioner.

Section 24-222 ::    
        
     
        ยง  24-222  After hours and weekend limits on construction work. Except
      as otherwise provided in this subchapter, it shall be unlawful to engage
      in or to cause or permit any person to engage in construction work other
      than on weekdays between the hours of 7 a.m. and 6  p.m.  A  person  may
      however  perform  construction work in connection with the alteration or
      repair  of  an  existing  one  or  two  family  owner-occupied  dwelling
      classified  in  occupancy group J-3 or a convent or rectory on Saturdays
      and Sundays between the hours of 10 a.m. and 4 p.m. provided  that  such
      dwelling is located more than 300 feet from a house of worship.
    
    
    
    
    
    
    

Section 24-223
--------------

Section 24-223 ::    
        
     
        ยง  24-223  After hours work authorization. (a) Notwithstanding section
      24-222 of this subchapter, an agency authorized  to  issue  permits  for
      construction work may, along with such permit, issue an after hours work
      authorization  for  the  work  site.  Such after hours authorization may
      permit construction work to be performed at the site before  7  a.m.  or
      after  6  p.m. on weekdays and/or on Saturdays and/or Sundays subject to
      the conditions and restrictions set forth in this section.
        (b) The agency issuing such authorization must obtain a  certification
      from  its  permittee that the permittee has developed a noise mitigation
      plan for the site in accordance with this subchapter and that such  plan
      is  in  compliance  with  the  noise  mitigation  rules.  In the case of
      emergency work such certification shall be submitted within 3 days after
      the commencement of the work.
        (c) If after hours  work  at  the  site  is  not  being  performed  in
      compliance  with such plan or where no plan is in effect, the department
      or the  agency  issuing  such  authorization,  at  the  request  of  the
      commissioner  or  on  its  own  account,  may  take  appropriate action,
      including but not limited to the  refusal  to  renew  such  after  hours
      authorization.
        (d)  Where there is full compliance with the noise mitigation plan yet
      nevertheless aggregate sound levels from the site where an  after  hours
      authorization  is  in effect exceed 8dB(A) above the ambient sound level
      as measured in any residential receiving property  dwelling  unit  (with
      windows   and  doors  that  may  affect  the  measurement  closed),  the
      commissioner may request the person performing the work to  confer  with
      representatives  of the department regarding additional noise mitigation
      measures that may be employed at the  site  to  reduce  aggregate  sound
      levels.  After  such conference the commissioner may direct amendment of
      the noise mitigation plan for the site. Failure to respond to a  request
      for  a  conference or to amend the noise mitigation plan within the time
      prescribed in a notice issued by the department shall be a violation  of
      this code.
        (e) Authorization for after hours construction work may only be issued
      in the following circumstances:
        (1)   Emergency  work.  Agencies  shall  authorize  such  after  hours
      construction work  for  emergency  conditions,  inside  or  outside  the
      property  line, involving a threat to public safety or causing or likely
      to cause the imminent interruption of service required by law,  contract
      or  franchise.  An  emergency  authorization  issued  pursuant  to  this
      paragraph shall expire as determined by the agency but no later than the
      ninetieth day after its issuance and shall be  renewable  in  accordance
      with agency procedures while the emergency continues.
        (2)  Public  safety.  Agencies  may  authorize  such after hours work,
      inside or outside of the property line, where the agency determines that
      the work cannot reasonably  or  practicably  be  performed  on  weekdays
      between  the  hours  of  7 a.m. and 6 p.m. because of traffic congestion
      and/or concern for worker and/or public safety. An authorization  issued
      pursuant  to this paragraph shall expire as determined by the agency but
      no later than  the  ninetieth  day  after  its  issuance  and  shall  be
      renewable in accordance with agency procedures.
        (3)  City  construction  projects.  Agencies may authorize after hours
      work by or on behalf of city agencies for projects that  are  judicially
      mandated  or  the  subject  of  consent orders and/or where a project is
      necessary  in  the  public  interest  including  but  not   limited   to
      facilities,  equipment,  and  infrastructure for the provision of water,
      sewerage, sanitation, transportation and other  services  necessary  for
      the  health or safety of the public. An authorization issued pursuant to
    
      this paragraph for a city construction project shall  remain  in  effect
      for the duration of the project.
        (4)   Construction   activities   with   minimal   noise  impact.  The
      commissioner shall promulgate rules setting forth a list of construction
      activities with minimal  noise  impact  and  specific  noise  mitigation
      measures  applicable  to  such  activities.  Agencies  may authorize the
      performance of such construction activities after  hours  in  accordance
      with such rules.
        (5)  Undue  hardship.  Agencies  may authorize after hours work if the
      commissioner certifies that the permit holder has substantiated a  claim
      of undue hardship resulting from unique site characteristics, unforeseen
      conditions,   scheduling  commitments  and/or  financial  considerations
      outside the control of the permit holder  and  that  the  applicant  has
      received approval from the department of an alternative noise mitigation
      plan  pursuant  to  section  24-221  of  this subchapter, specifying the
      activities  and  devices  that  will  be  used  for  such  after   hours
      construction and setting forth the additional mitigation measures, above
      and  beyond  those  measures  otherwise  required  for  such devices and
      activities pursuant to the department's rules, that the  applicant  will
      use  to  significantly limit noise emissions from the site of such after
      hours work. Applications for such certification shall  be  submitted  to
      the  department in a form and manner to be set forth in the rules of the
      department. The applicant for an after hours  authorization  under  this
      paragraph shall submit such certification to the issuing agency.

        ยง  24-224 Construction work without noise mitigation plan unlawful. It
      shall be unlawful to perform work at any construction site in  the  city
      that  is  not in compliance with a noise mitigation plan where such plan
      is required pursuant to this subchapter and with  the  noise  mitigation
      rules  adopted  pursuant  to  this subchapter. Notwithstanding any other
      provision of this code, construction work performed in accordance with a
      noise mitigation plan that is in full compliance  with  this  subchapter
      and  such  rules  shall  be  deemed to be in compliance with all decibel
      level limits set forth in other subchapters of this code. The provisions
      of this subchapter shall supersede all other  provisions  of  this  code
      relating  to  construction  activities  or devices that are inconsistent
      with or in conflict therewith.
