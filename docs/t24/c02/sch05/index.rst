Section 24-225 ::    
        
     
        §  24-225  Refuse collection vehicles. (a) No person shall sell, offer
      for sale, operate or permit to be operated a refuse collection  vehicle,
      equipped  with a compacter, that produces a maximum sound level when the
      compacting mechanism is in the  compacting  cycle  but  not  engaged  in
      compacting  a load that exceeds 80 dB(A), when measured by a sound level
      meter set for slow response at a distance of 35 feet or  more  from  the
      compacting unit.
        (b)  It  shall be unlawful to operate or cause to be operated a refuse
      collection vehicle, including such a vehicle equipped with a  compacter,
      within  50  feet of any residential receiving property at or after 11:00
      p.m. and  before  7:00  a.m.  if  the  aggregate  sound,  not  including
      impulsive  sound,  generated by the collection and compacting activities
      exceeds 85 dB(A) when measured by  a  sound  level  meter  set  to  slow
      response at a distance of 35 feet or more from the vehicle. On and after
      July  1,  2012  such  aggregate  sound  shall  not  exceed 80 dB(A). The
      provisions of this subdivision shall  not  apply  to  the  operation  of
      refuse  collection vehicles during an emergency such as a storm or other
      event that causes delays in refuse collection.

      New York, or operate or permit to be operated an  air  compressor  that,
      when  operated,  produces  a  maximum  sound  level,  when measured at a
      distance of one meter or more from the nearest major surface of such air
      compressor, exceeding 80  dB(A)  for  sizes  greater  than  350  cfm  or
      exceeding 75 dB(A) for sizes 350 cfm or less.
        (c) Except for construction work outside the property line on a public
      right-of-way,  no  person  shall operate or permit to be operated an air
      compressor so as to generate sound levels  in  excess  of  75  dB(A)  as
      measured at any receiving property.
    
    
    
    
    
    
    

Section 24-227
--------------

Section 24-227 ::    
        
     
        § 24-227 Circulation devices. (a) No person shall operate or permit to
      be  operated  a circulation device in such a manner as to create a sound
      level in excess of 42 dB(A) when measured inside  a  receiving  property
      dwelling unit. The measurement shall be taken with the window or terrace
      door  open  at a point three feet from the open portion of the window or
      terrace door.
        (b) On and after the effective  date  of  this  section,  when  a  new
      circulation  device  is  installed  on  any  building lot or an existing
      device on any building lot is replaced, the cumulative  sound  from  all
      circulation  devices  on  such  building  lot owned or controlled by the
      owner or person in control of the new  device  being  installed  or  the
      existing  device being replaced shall not exceed 45 dB(A), when measured
      as specified in subdivision a of this section. For a period of two years
      after the effective date of this section,  this  subdivision  shall  not
      apply  to  the replacement of a circulation device that was installed on
      any building lot prior to the effective date of this section by a device
      of comparable capacity.
        (c) Except as otherwise provided in subdivision  b  of  this  section,
      with  respect to circulation devices installed on any building lot prior
      to the effective date of this section, the sound level limit of 42 dB(A)
      referred to in subdivision  a  of  this  section  shall  apply  to  each
      individual  device  except that if the cumulative sound from all devices
      owned or controlled by the same person on  a  building  lot  exceeds  50
      dB(A),  when measured as specified in subdivision a of this section, the
      commissioner may order the owner or person in control of such devices to
      achieve a 5 dB(A) reduction in such cumulative sound  level  within  not
      more than 12 months after the issuance of such order.
    
    
    
    
    
    
    

Section 24-228
--------------

Section 24-228 ::    
        
     
        § 24-228 Construction, exhausts and other devices. (a) No person shall
      operate  or use or cause to be operated or used a construction device or
      combination of devices in such a way as to create an unreasonable noise.
      For the purposes of this section unreasonable noise  shall  include  but
      shall  not  be  limited  to  sound that exceeds the following prohibited
      noise levels:
        (1) Sound, other than impulsive sound, attributable to the  source  or
      sources,  that  exceeds  85  dB(A)  as measured 50 or more feet from the
      source or sources at a point outside the property line where the  source
      or sources are located or as measured 50 or more feet from the source or
      sources on a public right-of-way.
        (2)  Impulsive  sound, attributable to the source, that is 15 dB(A) or
      more above the ambient sound level as measured at  any  point  within  a
      receiving  property or as measured at a distance of 15 feet or more from
      the source on a public right-of-way. Impulsive  sound  levels  shall  be
      measured  in  the  A-weighting network with the sound level meter set to
      fast response. The ambient sound level shall be taken in the A-weighting
      network with the sound level meter set to slow response.
        (b) Where a particular sound source or device is  subject  to  decibel
      level limits and requirements specifically prescribed for such source or
      device  elsewhere in this code, such specific decibel limits shall apply
      to such device or source. However, if  aggregate  sound  levels  from  a
      construction   site  exceed  the  limits  set  forth  in  this  section,
      compliance with such specific decibel limits shall not be a  defense  in
      any proceeding relating to a violation of this section.
    
    
    
    
    
    
    

Section 24-228.1

Section 24-228.1 ::    
        
     
        §  24-228.1  Exhausts.  No person shall cause or permit discharge into
      the open air of the exhaust of any device, including but not limited  to
      any  steam  engine,  diesel  engine,  internal  combustion engine, power
      tools, compressors or turbine engine, so as to  create  an  unreasonable
      noise.    For  the  purposes  of  this  section unreasonable noise shall
      include but shall not be limited to sound that  exceeds  the  prohibited
      noise levels set forth in section 24-228.
    
    
    
    
    
    
    

Section 24-229
--------------

Section 24-229 ::    
        
     
        §  24-229  Containers  and  construction material. (a) No person shall
      handle or transport or cause to be handled or transported on any  public
      right-of-way any container or any construction material in such a way as
      to  create  an  unreasonable  noise.  For  the  purposes of this section
      unreasonable noise shall  include  but  shall  not  be  limited  to  the
      following prohibited noise levels:
        (1)  Sound,  other  than  impulsive  sound, attributable to the source
      measured at a level of 10 dB(A) or more above the ambient  sound  level,
      as measured at any point within a receiving property or as measured at a
      distance of 15 feet or more from the source on a public right-of-way.
        (2)  Impulsive  sound, attributable to the source, measured at a level
      of 15 dB(A) or more above the ambient sound level, as  measured  at  any
      point  within  a  receiving  property or as measured at a distance of 15
      feet or more from the source on a public right-of-way.  Impulsive  sound
      levels shall be measured in the A-weighting network with the sound level
      meter  set  to  fast response. The ambient sound level shall be taken in
      the A-weighting network with the sound level meter set to slow response.
        (b) This section shall not apply to the operation of refuse collection
      vehicles regulated pursuant to section 24-225.
    
    
    
    
    
    
    

Section 24-230
--------------

Section 24-230 ::    
        
     
        §  24-230  Paving breakers. (a) No person shall operate or cause to be
      operated a paving breaker,  other  than  one  operated  electrically  or
      hydraulically,  unless  a  pneumatic  discharge muffler certified by the
      manufacturer of such muffler to provide a dynamic insertion  loss  of  5
      dB(A)  of  the  sound  released  from  the  air discharge of such paving
      breaker is installed on such air discharge.
        (b) No person shall sell, offer for sale for use within  the  city  of
      New  York,  operate  or permit to be operated a paving breaker that when
      operated produces a maximum sound level  that  exceeds  95  dB(A),  when
      measured  at  a distance of one meter or more from a face of such paving
      breaker.
    
    
    
    
    
    
    

Section 24-231
--------------

Section 24-231 ::    
        
     
        § 24-231 Commercial music. (a) No person shall make or cause or permit
      to  be  made  or caused any music originating from or in connection with
      the operation of any commercial establishment  or  enterprise  when  the
      level  of  sound  attributable  to  such  music,  as measured inside any
      receiving property dwelling unit:
        (1) is in excess of 42 dB(A) as measured with a sound level meter; or
        (2) is in excess of 45 dB in any one-third octave band having a center
      frequency between 63 hertz and 500 hertz (ANSI bands numbers 18  through
      27, Inclusive), in accordance with American National Standards Institute
      standard S1.6-1984; or
        (3)  causes  a 6 dB(C) or more increase in the total sound level above
      the ambient sound level as measured in decibels  in  the  "C"  weighting
      network provided that the ambient sound level is in excess of 62 dB(C).
        (b)(1) The commissioner may recommend to the board that there shall be
      no  civil  penalty  imposed  for  a  first violation of this section if,
      within 30 days after the issuance of such violation or,  if  applicable,
      within the time granted by the commissioner pursuant to paragraph two of
      this  subdivision, the respondent admits liability for the violation and
      files a certification with the department  in  a  form  and  manner  and
      containing  such information and documentation as shall be prescribed in
      the department's rules that (i) permanent improvements or  modifications
      have  been  made  to the establishment, including but not limited to the
      installation of  appropriate  sound  insulation,  isolators,  suspension
      mounting   and/or   sound  mitigation  devices  or  materials  and  (ii)
      appropriate sound measurements taken in accordance with the department's
      rules substantiate that the establishment is in full compliance with the
      sound levels set forth in this section. If the commissioner accepts such
      certification of compliance, he or she shall recommend to the board that
      no civil penalty shall be imposed for the violation. Such violation  may
      nevertheless serve as a predicate for purposes of imposing penalties for
      subsequent violations of this section.
        (2)  Where  the  completion  of  appropriate permanent improvements or
      modifications and testing within 30  days  after  the  issuance  of  the
      violation  would cause the respondent undue hardship, the respondent may
      apply to the commissioner for additional time to submit  an  appropriate
      certification  of compliance, but not more than 30 days. Application for
      such additional time must be submitted to  the  commissioner  within  30
      days  after  the  issuance  of  the violation along with an admission of
      liability and appropriate documents in support of  the  claim  of  undue
      hardship.
        (3)  Nothing  in  this  subdivision  shall  be  construed  to prohibit
      enforcement personnel from  issuing  additional  notices  of  violation,
      summonses or appearance tickets where sound levels exceed the limits set
      forth  in  subdivision  a of this section during the periods of time set
      forth in paragraphs one and two of this subdivision for submission of  a
      certification of compliance for a first violation.
        (c)  In  any  proceeding under this section it shall be an affirmative
      defense that the receiving  property  dwelling  unit  was  not  lawfully
      occupied at the time of the violation.
        (d)  The  commissioner may grant a variance from strict application of
      the limits set forth in subdivision (a) of this section for a commercial
      establishment or enterprise that was in operation at the same site prior
      to the date of enactment of the local law that added this section if  he
      or  she  finds  that  there  are  practical  difficulties or unnecessary
      hardship in the application of such provisions  in  the  specific  case,
      provided  that  as  a  condition  to  the  grant  of  any such variance,
      sufficient evidence or data is submitted by an applicant that there  are
      physical   conditions   or   zoning   district   conditions,   including
    
      irregularity in lot size characteristics and zoning changes, and that as
      a result of such  physical  or  zoning  district  conditions,  practical
      difficulties  or  unnecessary  hardship  arise  in  complying  with such
      provisions.  In  granting  a  variance  the commissioner may impose such
      terms and conditions as he or she  deems  necessary  to  carry  out  the
      intent  of  this  section  to  minimize  noise  emissions from the site.
      Application for a waiver shall be submitted in such form and  manner  as
      shall be provided by rules of the department and shall include in detail
      proposed  measures which the applicant proposes will minimize sound from
      the site. A variance granted pursuant to this subdivision shall  not  be
      transferable  but  shall  expire  upon  a  change  in ownership, size or
      location of the commercial establishment  or  enterprise  in  accordance
      with  the  rules  of  the department. Violation of the conditions of any
      variance shall be deemed to be a violation of this section.
