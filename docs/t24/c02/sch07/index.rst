Section 24-245 ::    
        
     
        § 24-245 Operating certificates and renewal of operating certificates;
      tunneling  permits;  when required. (a) The commissioner shall at his or
      her discretion promulgate regulations pursuant to section eleven hundred
      five of the city charter directing the  placement  of  air  compressors,
      paving breakers, refuse compacting vehicles and rapid transit railroads,
      including  but not limited to their rolling stock, track and track beds,
      passenger stations, tunnels,  elevated  structures,  yards,  depots  and
      garages, onto an operating certificate list, setting out the reasons for
      such  placement,  and  setting  out  the period of time from issuance or
      renewal during which such operating certificate shall be  valid,  unless
      sooner revoked or cancelled.
        (b) No person shall cause or permit the use or operation of any device
      placed  on the operating certificate list pursuant to subdivision (a) of
      this section except for the purpose of testing such device without first
      obtaining an operating certificate from the commissioner. The  placement
      of  such  a device not bearing an operating certificate at a location of
      its customary operation shall be considered a violation of this  section
      in any proceeding pursuant to any applicable section of subchapter eight
      of this chapter of this code except section 24-269.
        (c)  No  person  shall  engage  in  or  permit any person to engage in
      tunneling  without  first  obtaining  a  tunneling   permit   from   the
      commissioner.  A  separate  permit shall be obtained for each shaft of a
      tunnel.
        (d) Prior to advertising for bids for contracts  involving  tunneling,
      the  agency  of  the  city  of  New York proposing to so advertise shall
      request the commissioner in writing for a statement of the  requirements
      or standards that will govern the proposed tunneling activities pursuant
      to  section  24-248 of this subchapter. The aforesaid requirements shall
      be furnished by the commissioner to the contracting  agency  in  writing
      within thirty days after receipt of the request and shall be included by
      the  contracting  agency in the contract specifications for the proposed
      tunneling. The conditions under which the permit shall be granted to the
      contractor shall be consistent  with  the  statement  furnished  by  the
      commissioner  to  the  contracting  agency for inclusion in the contract
      specifications.
        (e) Notwithstanding the existence of  a  valid  tunneling  permit,  no
      person  shall, except in the case of urgent necessity in the interest of
      public safety, conduct or permit to be conducted blasting operations  at
      any  time  other  than  on  weekdays and other than between the hours of
      seven a.m. and seven p.m. unless a special permit is obtained  from  the
      fire department pursuant to subdivision d of section 27-4039.
