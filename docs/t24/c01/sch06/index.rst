Section 24-145 ::    
        
     
        §  24-145 Emission of particulate matter from refuse burning equipment
      and fuel burning equipment; weight-rate standard. (a)  No  person  shall
      cause  or  permit the emission of particulate matter from refuse burning
      equipment and fuel burning equipment if the emission from such equipment
      is in violation of the provisions of section 24-141 or  24-142  of  this
      code  or  if  the  particulate  matter  emitted  as measured in the flue
      exceeds the following limits:
        (1) In refuse burning  equipment,  the  permissible  particulate  rate
      shall  be  as provided in figure four of section 24-153 of this code. If
      two or more refuse burning units are connected to  a  single  flue,  the
      total  capacity rating of all refuse burning units connected to the flue
      shall be the capacity rating for the purpose of computing the amount  of
      particulate matter which may be emitted. If a single refuse burning unit
      is  manifold  to  two  or  more  flues the capacity rating of the single
      refuse burning unit shall be the capacity  rating  for  the  purpose  of
      computing the amount of particulate matter which may be emitted;
        (2)  In  fuel  burning  equipment  in  which  the preponderance of the
      particulate matter emitted is caused by the burning of fuel, 0.40 pounds
      for each million Btu per hour input if  the  equipment  has  a  capacity
      rating  of  ten  million Btu per hour or less. If the capacity rating of
      the fuel burning equipment is more than ten million Btu  per  hour,  the
      amount  of  permissible  emissions  of  particulate  matter  shall be as
      provided in figure three of section 24-153 of this code, as measured  on
      a dry basis.
        (b)  If two or more fuel burning units are connected to a single flue,
      the total capacity rating of all fuel burning  units  connected  to  the
      flue  shall  be  the  capacity  rating  for the purpose of computing the
      amount of particulate matter which may be  emitted.  If  a  single  fuel
      burning unit is manifold to two or more flues the capacity rating of the
      single fuel burning unit shall be the capacity rating for the purpose of
      computing the amount of particulate matter which may be emitted.
    
    
    
    
    
    
    

Section 24-146

Section 24-146 ::    
        
     
        §  24-146  Preventing  particulate  matter  from  becoming  air-borne;
      spraying of asbestos prohibited; spraying  of  insulating  material  and
      demolition  regulated.  (a)  No person shall cause or permit particulate
      matter  to  be  handled,  transported  or  stored  without  taking  such
      precautions as may be ordered by the commissioner to prevent particulate
      matter from becoming air-borne.
        (b) Six months after August twentieth, nineteen hundred seventy-one no
      person  shall  cause  or permit the spraying of any substance containing
      asbestos  in  or  upon  a  building  or  other  structure   during   its
      construction,  alteration  or  repair, except if permitted by a variance
      granted pursuant to subdivision (e) of section 24-110 of this chapter.
        (c) No person shall cause or permit a building or its appurtenances or
      a road to be  constructed,  altered  or  repaired  without  taking  such
      precautions as may be ordered by the commissioner to prevent particulate
      matter from becoming air-borne.
        (d)  No  person  shall  cause  or  permit untreated open areas located
      within the boundaries of a zoning lot as defined by section 12-10 of the
      zoning resolution of the city of  New  York  to  be  maintained  without
      taking   reasonable  precautions  to  prevent  particulate  matter  from
      becoming air-borne.
        (e) No person shall cause or permit the  spraying  of  any  insulating
      material,  not  otherwise  prohibited  by  this  section, in or upon any
      building or other  structure  during  its  construction,  alteration  or
      repair, unless he or she complies with the following precautions:
        (1)  Before the start of spraying operations, all floor areas shall be
      shoveled clean. Before the application of insulating material commences,
      the floor of the areas shall be cleared of  all  objects,  material  and
      equipment  other than that employed in the application of the insulating
      material, or all objects, material, and equipment shall be covered  with
      plastic  or  other  approved  tarpaulins  in a manner that precludes the
      subsequent dispersal of particulate matter.
        (2) The entire floor, or the part of the floor to be insulated,  shall
      be  enclosed with plastic or other approved tarpaulins in a manner which
      shall preclude the escape of particulate matter from the enclosure.  All
      interior  open  areas,  such  as elevator shafts and stairwells shall be
      enclosed in a manner which  shall  prevent  the  escape  of  particulate
      matter  from the working area. Stack effect of the shafts and stairwells
      shall be considered in providing proper enclosures. An enclosure will be
      considered satisfactory  only  if  visible  insulating  material  cannot
      escape from the enclosure.
        (3)  Wet  insulating  material  which has fallen to the floor shall be
      swept up to prevent dispersal of  dried  material.  Under  no  condition
      shall this material be removed later than at the end of the working day.
      Swept-up  material  shall be placed in a heavy plastic bag strong enough
      to resist tearing or  breaking  under  normal  handling  conditions  and
      clearly  marked as containing insulating material waste. The contents of
      the aforementioned plastic bags shall  not  be  transferred  to  another
      container.  The plastic bags shall be placed upon a vehicle for disposal
      at a site approved by the commissioner.
        (4) All floors shall be vacuumed shortly after drying. The contents of
      the vacuum bag shall be carefully placed in  a  container  of  the  type
      described in paragraph three of this subdivision and shall thereafter be
      placed  on  a vehicle for removal and disposal at a site approved by the
      commissioner.
        (5) The materials used to  form  the  enclosure  shall  be  thoroughly
      vacuumed  upon  completion  of  the application of the insulation in the
      area. The entire floor area and ledges and surfaces including tarpaulins
    
      upon which waste insulation material may  have  fallen,  shall  then  be
      vacuumed or revacuumed before removal of the enclosures.
        (6)  Enclosures  shall  not  be  dismantled  until  the  area has been
      thoroughly vacuumed after completion of spraying and clean-up.
        (7) All areas used for opening  bags  containing  insulating  material
      and/or  changing  of  hoppers  shall  be  enclosed in such a manner that
      insulating material shall not be permitted to escape from the  immediate
      area in which such activity takes place.
        (8)  Signs  shall  be posted outside enclosures warning persons of the
      hazards of entering the enclosure without appropriate apparel.
        (9) All persons involved in the spraying of insulating material at the
      site must be furnished with suitable coveralls which must be left at the
      site. No person shall be permitted in  an  area  in  which  spraying  or
      handling  of  insulating  material  has  taken  place  until  the  final
      vacuuming referred to in paragraph five of  this  subdivision  has  been
      accomplished, unless such person is furnished with or wears coveralls of
      the  type  described herein. Facilities shall be provided and procedures
      instituted and supervised that preclude the  removal  and  dispersal  of
      insulating  material from the construction site on the clothing or other
      appurtenances of persons leaving the area.
        (10) Any plenum or other structures coated  with  insulating  material
      which are intended for use in circulation of air in the building must be
      thoroughly cleaned of all debris, dust and waste insulation. All applied
      insulation  material  within  a  plenum  or  duct  must be coated with a
      sealant approved by the commissioner which  precludes  exposure  of  the
      material to the circulating air whenever the commissioner after ordering
      tests  to  be  conducted  by the manufacturer in accordance with section
      24-107, determines that the insulation material needs such a sealant.
        (11) A person shall  be  assigned  the  full  time  responsibility  of
      supervising  the  spraying  and  related  operations  to  assure that no
      insulating material is released from the construction site.
        (12) In case of emission of insulation material from the  construction
      site,  immediate  steps  shall  be  taken to cause the cessation of such
      emissions by either effective control measures or work stoppage  at  the
      source  of  the  emissions.  There  shall then be immediate and complete
      clean-up of all material that  has  escaped  the  construction  site  by
      measures  that  will  insure that no further dispersal of any insulating
      material into the atmosphere can occur.
        (f) No person shall cause or permit a building or other  structure  to
      be  demolished,  except  pursuant  to  chapter one of title seventeen or
      article eight of subchapter three of chapter one of title twenty-six  of
      the code, unless he or she complies with the following precautions:
        (1)  Demolition  by  toppling  of  walls  shall  not occur except when
      approved by the commissioner.
        (2) Before the demolition of any section  of  wall,  floor,  roof,  or
      other  structure,  adequate  wetting procedures to lay the dust shall be
      employed. All debris shall be thoroughly wetted before loading and while
      dumping into trucks, other vehicles or containers. In all cases  and  at
      all  stages  of  demolition, wetting procedures shall be adequate to lay
      the dust. Trucks shall be adequately covered or enclosed to prevent dust
      dispersion while in transit to point of disposal.
        (3) No structural members shall be dropped or thrown  from  any  floor
      but shall be carefully lowered to ground level by hoists.
        (4)  Effective  January  first,  nineteen  hundred seventy-two, debris
      shall not be dropped or thrown from any floor to  any  floor  below.  In
      buildings   twelve   stories  or  greater  in  height  debris  shall  be
      transported from the upper floors via enclosed, dust-tight chutes or via
      buckets. Where chutes are used, a water soaking spray shall be  employed
    
      to saturate the debris before it reaches the point of discharge from the
      chute.  Where buckets are used, the debris shall be adequately wetted to
      preclude dust dispersion when buckets are dumped.
        (5)  Effective  January  first,  nineteen  hundred seventy-two, in the
      event particulate matter becomes airborne for  a  continuous  period  of
      fifteen  minutes,  despite  the  application of the above procedures, or
      because freezing temperatures preclude the use of water for  laying  the
      demolition  dust, the work of demolition shall cease at once until other
      adequate measures can be taken. Alternate procedures shall be  evaluated
      by the commissioner before initiation thereof.

        (6) The commissioner shall charge a fee  not  to  exceed  one  hundred
      dollars  to  process  the  application  to  issue  or  renew an asbestos
      handling certificate and a fee not to exceed two hundred  fifty  dollars
      to process the application of an individual as an asbestos investigator.
        (7)  The  commissioner  may suspend the processing of applications for
      certification  of  individuals  as  asbestos  handlers,   investigators,
      planners,  designers,  and  other titles for which training requirements
      are specified by AHERA, and  the  certification  of  safety  and  health
      programs  when  the commissioner determines that regulations promulgated
      pursuant to article thirty of the labor law  for  the  certification  of
      such individuals and for the certification of safety and health programs
      are   essentially   equivalent   to   regulations   promulgated  by  the
      commissioner, and that such certifications are in fact being issued.
        (e) (1) a. The commissioner shall prescribe forms for and the  content
      of  asbestos  inspection  reports to be submitted in accordance with the
      provisions of subdivisions a, b, or c of  section  27-198.1  of  article
      nineteen  of  subchapter one of chapter one of title twenty-seven of the
      code. Such reports shall require the furnishing  of  information  deemed
      relevant  by the commissioner for evaluating, in the case of an asbestos
      project, the scope, complexity and duration of such project, or  if  not
      an asbestos project, information deemed relevant by the commissioner for
      evaluating  the  samples  taken  and the validity of sampling techniques
      utilized in preparing such inspection report, and  the  compliance  with
      the  provisions of this section, any regulations promulgated thereunder,
      and any applicable federal and or state laws or regulations.
        b. An asbestos inspection report regarding an asbestos project,  where
      the  work  to  be  performed will cause the generation of waste which is
      asbestos containing material, shall include (i) the amount of such waste
      which will be generated; (ii) the name of the person who will remove the
    
      waste and the number of the industrial waste transporter  permit  issued
      to  such  person  pursuant  to article twenty-seven of the environmental
      conservation law; and (iii)  the  site  at  which  such  waste  will  be
      disposed of.
        c.  If  at  the  time  the  asbestos inspection report for an asbestos
      project is required to be filed, any of the information  required  under
      subparagraph  b  of this paragraph is not known, an amended report shall
      be filed thereafter with the department  as  soon  as  such  information
      becomes known. Provided no person shall authorize the transport of waste
      which is asbestos containing material unless all information required in
      paragraph  b  has  been  filed  with  the  department not less than five
      business days prior to the time  such  waste  is  transported.  Provided
      further,  however, the commissioner may for good cause shown and on such
      terms and conditions as he or she deems reasonable and necessary  permit
      the  filing  of  such  report less than five days prior to the time such
      waste is transported.
        d. Copies of all asbestos inspection reports received by or filed with
      the department and any amendments thereto indicating that waste which is
      asbestos containing material will be generated shall be forwarded to the
      department of sanitation.
        (2) The commissioner may by regulation also require for any work which
      is not subject to the provisions of subdivision a of section 27-198.1 of
      article nineteen of subchapter one of chapter one of title  twenty-seven
      of  the  code  and  for which a permit is required under article nine of
      subchapter  one  of  chapter  one  of  such  title  that   an   asbestos
      investigator  certify  that the work to be performed will not constitute
      an asbestos project or that an asbestos inspection report  be  completed
      and  submitted  to  the  department  of buildings in conjunction with an
      application for such permit.  The  commissioner  may  exclude  from  any
      regulation  promulgated pursuant to this paragraph certain types of work
      within a permit category.
        (f) (1) a. The commissioner shall promulgate regulations  establishing
      the  requirements  of  an  asbestos  removal  plan  to  be  submitted in
      accordance with the provisions of subdivision c of section  27-198.1  of
      article  nineteen of subchapter one of chapter one of title twenty-seven
      of the code and shall  specify  the  type  or  types  of  demolition  or
      alteration  work  for  which  such  submission  shall be required. Plans
      submitted shall be approved by the commissioner only upon a satisfactory
      showing that such  plan  will  effect  compliance  with  all  applicable
      provisions  of  this  section,  regulations  promulgated thereunder, all
      applicable federal or state laws or regulations and, in  addition,  that
      to  the extent feasible, the removal of asbestos will be completed prior
      to the commencement of any demolition work. No plan shall be  considered
      for  approval  unless accompanied by the payment of a fee established by
      the commissioner not to exceed eighteen hundred dollars.
        b. Such plan, where the work to be performed will cause the generation
      of waste which is asbestos containing material, shall include:  (i)  the
      amount  of  such  waste  which  will  be generated; (ii) the name of the
      person who will remove the waste and  the  number  of  industrial  waste
      transporter   permit   issued   to   such  person  pursuant  to  article
      twenty-seven of the environmental conservation law; and (iii)  the  site
      at which such waste will be disposed of.
        c.  If  at the time asbestos removal plan is required to be filed, any
      of the information required under subparagraph b of  this  paragraph  is
      not known, an amended plan shall be filed thereafter with the department
      as  soon  as  such  information  becomes known. Provided no person shall
      authorize the transport of waste which is asbestos  containing  material
      unless  all  information required in paragraph b has been filed with the
    
      department not less than five business days prior to the time such waste
      is transported. Provided further, however, the commissioner may for good
      cause shown and on  such  terms  and  conditions  as  he  or  she  deems
      reasonable  and  necessary  permit  the filing of such amended plan less
      than five days prior to the time such waste is transported.
        d. Copies of all asbestos removal plans filed with the department  and
      any   amendments   thereto  indicating  that  waste  which  is  asbestos
      containing  material  will  be  generated  shall  be  forwarded  to  the
      department of sanitattion.
        (2)  The commissioner shall act within a reasonable time not to exceed
      sixty days on an application for approval of an asbestos  removal  plan,
      and  shall  notify  the  applicant  in writing of his or her approval or
      disapproval of the application. If an application  is  disapproved,  the
      commissioner  shall  set  forth  his  or her objections in the notice of
      disapproval. Within sixty days after service on  the  applicant  of  the
      notice  of  disapproval,  the  applicant may request the commissioner to
      reconsider the application  by  responding  in  writing  to  the  stated
      objections. The commissioner shall consider the applicant's responses to
      his  or her objections, and shall notify the applicant in writing within
      a reasonable time, not to exceed sixty days, of his or her  approval  or
      denial  of  the application. Failure to respond to the stated objections
      or request an extension of time within sixty days after service  of  the
      notice of disapproval shall be deemed a denial of the application.
        (g)  The  commissioner  may promulgate any regulations he or she deems
      necessary to protect the health and safety of workers and the public  in
      connection  with  work  not  constituting  an  asbestos project in which
      asbestos is or is likely to be disturbed.
        (h) A notice or order to stop work may be issued by the  commissioner,
      or  his  or  her authorized representative, at any time when it is found
      that work is being performed in violation  of  the  provisions  of  this
      section,  or  any  rules or regulations promulgated thereunder and which
      poses a threat to human safety. Such notice or order may be given orally
      or in writing to the owner, lessee or occupant of the property involved,
      or to the agent of any of them, or to the person or  persons  performing
      the  work  and  may  require  all  persons  in  or about the building or
      premises to vacate the same forthwith, and also require such work to  be
      done  as, in the opinion of the commissioner, may be necessary to remove
      the danger therefrom. Such notice or order shall be valid for  a  period
      of  time  not  to exceed seventy-two hours and may be extended only upon
      application to the board in accordance with the  provisions  of  section
      24-178 of this code.
        (i)  The  commissioner  may  grant  individual  variances for asbestos
      projects at specific sites,  from  particular  requirements  related  to
      asbestos  prescribed  by  this  code  and  regulations  or orders of the
      commissioner  promulgated  thereunder,  whenever  it  is   found,   upon
      presentation  of  adequate proof, that compliance with such requirements
      would  impose  unreasonable  hardship.  In  granting  a   variance   the
      commissioner may impose such conditions as the policies of this code may
      require  and  shall  publish in the City Record no later than seven days
      after the granting of such variance a statement of the  reasons  leading
      to his or her decision.
        (j)  The  commissioner may establish a fee to process the applications
      listed in this subdivision as follows:
        (1) For any asbestos project not requiring a permit or  plan  approval
      issued  by  the  department  of  buildings  and  for  which  an asbestos
      inspection report or asbestos removal plan is required by  this  section
      and  by  regulations  promulgated  pursuant thereto to be filed with the
      commissioner, the commissioner shall be entitled to charge a fee not  to
    
      exceed  twelve  hundred  dollars  for  the asbestos inspection report or
      eighteen hundred dollars for the asbestos removal plan.
        (2)  To  process an application for a variance submitted in accordance
      with subdivision (j) of this section, the department shall  be  entitled
      to  charge  a  fee  as  established  by  the  commissioner not to exceed
      eighteen hundred dollars.
        (3) The commissioner may establish a fee not to exceed  the  following
      amounts  for processing applications for the certification or renewal of
      certification of safety and health programs established pursuant to this
      section:
     
           PROGRAM FEE PER PROGRAM
     
           Asbestos Handler $1500.00 Asbestos Supervisor $ 300.00 Asbestos
           Investigator $ 750.00 Biennial Review Course $ 500.00 Refresher Course $
           300.00
     
        (k) The commissioner may promulgate any additional regulations  he  or
      she deems necessary to effectuate the purposes of this section.
        (l)  The  commissioner shall promulgate regulations requiring asbestos
      investigators to submit on  a  timely  basis  to  the  commissioner  the
      results  of  any asbestos survey or investigation for asbestos conducted
      in  accordance  with  this  section  and  with  regulations  promulgated
      pursuant  thereto  if,  during or as a result of such asbestos survey or
      investigation, the asbestos investigator discovers  asbestos  containing
      material.  The  commissioner  may require the submission of the asbestos
      investigator's findings whether or not an asbestos project is planned or
      scheduled.
        (m) (1) In addition to submission of the asbestos inspection report or
      asbestos removal  plan,  the  commissioner  may  by  regulation  require
      additional  notification  to  the  department  prior to the start of the
      asbestos project. No person shall  cause  or  permit  any  abatement  of
      asbestos containing material without compliance with any such additional
      notification requirements.
        (2)  Except  as  specified  in  subparagraph  c  of  paragraph  one of
      subdivision (e) and subparagraph c of paragraph one of  subdivision  (f)
      of  this  section,  the  commissioner  may  prescribe  by regulation the
      circumstances under which an  asbestos  inspection  report  or  asbestos
      removal  plan  may  be  amended, and the circumstances under which a new
      asbestos inspection report or asbestos removal plan shall  be  submitted
      to  the  department.  The  commissioner  may  consider the extent of the
      proposed amendment, including but not limited to change in  floor  size,
      quantity  of  asbestos  containing  material  involved, project phasing,
      project duration, and replacement of abatement contractor.
        * (n) The commissioner shall adopt rules specifying the standards  for
      the   construction   of  temporary  structures  for  asbestos  abatement
      activities. In addition to any  other  requirements,  such  rules  shall
      provide  that  materials  used in the construction of such structures be
      non-combustible or flame resistant in compliance with reference standard
      NFPA 255-06 or NFPA 701-99, as such standards may be modified  by  local
      law or by the Department of Buildings pursuant to applicable rules.
        * NB There are 2 sb (n)'s
        * (n)  Sharing  the  results  of  inspections.  The  commissioner,  in
      coordination with the commissioner of the department  of  buildings  and
      the  fire commissioner, shall establish a procedure to share information
      regarding violations issued pursuant to this section, in accordance with
      the requirements of section 28-103.7.1 of the administrative code of the
      city of New York.
    
        * NB There are 2 sb (n)'s
        (o)  (1)  No asbestos abatement activities shall be performed within a
      building concurrently with demolition work for the  full  demolition  of
      such building or concurrently with the removal of one or more stories of
      such  building,  except as provided in this subdivision and the rules of
      the department.
        (2) Prior  to  the  issuance  of  a  full  demolition  permit  by  the
      department  of  buildings,  the  owner  of the building to be demolished
      shall submit to the department of buildings (i) certification, in a form
      to  be  provided  by  the  rules  of  the  department  of  environmental
      protection,  that  the  building is free of asbestos containing material
      or, (ii) documentation that the commissioner of environmental protection
      has issued a variance from this requirement pursuant to subdivision  (i)
      of  this  section  and  the  rules  of  the  department,  subject to the
      additional conditions set forth in paragraph four of this subdivision.
        (3) Prior to the issuance of an alteration permit by the department of
      buildings to remove one or more stories of a building, the owner of  the
      building  shall submit certification to the department of buildings in a
      form to be provided by the rules  of  the  department  of  environmental
      protection  (i)  that  the  stories  to  be removed are free of asbestos
      containing material and that no abatement activities will  be  performed
      anywhere  in  the building concurrently with the removal work authorized
      by such permit or (ii) that the commissioner of environmental protection
      has issued a variance from these requirements  pursuant  to  subdivision
      (i)  of  this  section  and  the rules of the department, subject to the
      additional conditions set forth in paragraph four of this subdivision.
        (4) Prior to granting any variance pursuant to subdivision (i) of this
      section relating to the full demolition of a building or the removal  of
      one  or  more stories of a building that would permit the performance of
      abatement activities concurrent with such  demolition  or  removal  work
      within  the  same building, the commissioner of environmental protection
      shall notify and consult with the commissioner of buildings and the fire
      commissioner  regarding  the  appropriate  safeguards  for  such   work.
      Notwithstanding  any  inconsistent  provision of section 24-146.3 of the
      administrative code, where a variance is  issued  to  perform  abatement
      activities  and  demolition or removal work concurrently within the same
      building, the asbestos abatement activities may not be performed without
      an asbestos permit issued pursuant to section  24-146.3,  regardless  of
      whether  such  a  permit  would  otherwise  be  required to perform such
      activity.
        (5) The commissioner shall post on-line within seven  days  notice  of
      any  variance  granted  under  this  subdivision with a statement of the
      reasons leading to his or her decision.
        (6) This subdivision shall not apply to full demolition or the removal
      of one or more stories performed as emergency work pursuant  to  article
      215  of  chapter  2  of  title  28  of the administrative code where the
      emergency warrants immediate commencement of the work or full demolition
      with asbestos in place authorized in accordance with 12 NYCRR 56-11.5.

Section 24-146.3 ::    
        
     
        §  24-146.3  Asbestos  abatement  permit.  (a)  The commissioner shall
      establish a permit requirement for asbestos projects, as defined in  the
      rules  of  the  department,  affecting  the safety of a building. On and
      after a date to be provided in the  rules  establishing  such  a  permit
      requirement,  it  shall  be  unlawful  to  commence  or engage in such a
      project unless the commissioner has issued an abatement permit for  such
      project.
        (b)  The  rules  shall  be  adopted  in  consultation  with  the  fire
      commissioner  and  the  commissioner  of  buildings  and  shall  specify
      criteria  for  the  issuance of such permits and requirements to enhance
      safety at the site  of  such  projects.  The  criteria  for  the  permit
      requirement  shall  include,  but shall not be limited to, the effect of
      the project on the maintenance of the means of egress in the building in
      compliance with applicable provisions of the New York city  construction
      codes,  the  New  York city fire code and other applicable provisions of
      law, the effect of the project on the fire  protection  systems  of  the
      building  and  whether  the project includes work performed only for the
      purpose of the asbestos project that may otherwise require a work permit
      from the department of buildings, such as but not limited to  alteration
      work  necessary  to  expose  asbestos material for removal to the extent
      that such work would otherwise require a work permit pursuant  to  title
      28 of the administrative code.
        (c) Application for an asbestos permit shall be made to the department
      in  such  form and containing such information as shall be prescribed in
      the rules of the department. The fee for such permit shall be set  forth
      in  the  rules  of  the  department. Where the proposed asbestos project
      would involve construction work that  would  otherwise  require  a  work
      permit  from  the  department  of  buildings, construction documents, as
      defined in chapter 1 of title 28 of the administrative  code,  shall  be
      part  of  the  abatement permit application filed with the department of
      environmental protection, except where the submission of such  documents
      is  waived  by  the  department  of  buildings  in  accordance  with the
      provisions of  section  28-104.7.12  of  the  administrative  code.  The
      commissioner of buildings, his or her duly authorized representative, or
      an  employee of the department of environmental protection designated by
      the commissioner of buildings  who  is  a  qualified  registered  design
      professional  with  experience in building construction and design shall
      approve  or  accept  such  construction  documents  on  behalf  of   the
      department  of buildings in accordance with all applicable provisions of
      title 28 of the administrative code and no  abatement  permit  shall  be
      issued without such approval or acceptance.
        (d)  The  commissioner  may,  on  written notice to the permit holder,
      revoke any abatement permit for failure to comply with the provisions of
      this section or section 24-146.1 or the rules adopted  pursuant  thereto
      or  whenever there has been any false statement or any misrepresentation
      as to a material fact in the application or other documents submitted to
      the department upon the basis  of  which  such  permit  was  issued;  or
      whenever an abatement permit has been issued in error and conditions are
      such  that  the  permit  should  not have been issued. Such notice shall
      inform the permit holder of the reasons for the proposed revocation  and
      that  the  applicant has the right to present to the commissioner or his
      or her representative within 10 business days of delivery of the  notice
      by  hand or 15 calendar days of mailing of the notice, information as to
      why the permit should not be revoked. The commissioner  may  immediately
      suspend  any  permit  without prior notice to the permit holder when the
      commissioner has determined that an imminent peril to life  or  property
      exists.  The  commissioner shall forthwith notify the permit holder that
      the permit has been suspended and the  reasons  therefore,  that  it  is
    
      proposed  to  be  revoked,  and  that the permit holder has the right to
      present to the commissioner or  his  or  her  representative  within  10
      business  days  of delivery of the notice by hand or 15 calendar days of
      mailing  of  the  notice  information as to why the permit should not be
      revoked.
        (e) The permit shall be posted  as  specified  in  the  rules  of  the
      department for the duration of the asbestos project.
        (f)  All  work  shall conform to the approved or accepted construction
      documents, and any approved amendments thereto.
        (g) The permittee shall comply with section 24-146.1 of this code  and
      the  rules  of  the department adopted pursuant to such section and with
      article 30 of the labor law and rules adopted pursuant to such  article.
      The  commissioner may issue a notice or order to stop work in accordance
      with the procedure set forth in subdivision (h) of section  24-146.1  at
      any  time  when  work is being performed in violation of this section or
      section 24-146.1 or rules adopted pursuant to  such  sections  and  such
      work poses a threat to human safety.

      restricted. (a) No person shall cause or permit the installation or  use
      of  any  device  or  use  of  any  means  which,  without resulting in a
      reduction in the total amount of air contaminant  emitted,  conceals  an
      emission of the air contaminant which would otherwise violate subchapter
      six of this code.
        (b)  No  person  shall  cause or permit the installation or use of any
      device or use of any means designed to  mask  the  emission  of  an  air

      action  plan.  (a)  If any control apparatus required by this code is or
      will be inoperative for more than six hours, the commissioner  shall  be
      provided  with  a repair and resumption schedule for his or her approval
      by the owner of the equipment.
        (b) Whenever the  emission  of  an  air  contaminant,  which  emission
      constitutes  a  violation  of  any  provision  of this code, occurs as a
      result of, malfunction, breakdown or removal from service  of  equipment
      or  apparatus,  the owner of the equipment from which the emission of an
      air contaminant occurs shall report the emission of the air  contaminant
      and  its  attendant  circumstances  to  the  commissioner not later than
      thirty minutes from its discovery. The  report  shall  be  confirmed  in
      writing,  in  a form prescribed by the commissioner not later than three
      days thereafter.
        (c) An owner of such equipment shall  not  continue  it  in  operation
      during  any  malfunction,  breakdown, or shutdown of the equipment or of
      the apparatus which  serves  the  equipment,  except  with  the  express
      permission  of  the commissioner. Such permission shall be given only as
      may  be  necessary  to  protect  the  public  health  and  safety.  This
      subdivision  shall not apply where the emission of air contaminant is of
      a type or within the limits permitted by this code.
        (d) This section shall not apply to refuse burning  equipment,  refuse
      compacting  equipment  and  fuel burning equipment which primarily serve
      residents of a building or structure which is occupied in  whole  or  in
      part  as  the residence of one or more persons, or which is occupied for
      transacting business, for rendering professional services, for rendering
      public or civic services, or for performing  other  commercial  services
      that  may  incidentally  involve  the  storage  of limited quantities of
      stocks of goods for office use or purposes.
        (e) Whenever the commissioner  shall  determine  that  equipment,  for
      which  a  certificate of operation is required by this code, may emit or
      be capable of emitting dangerous or odorous air contaminants, either  as
      a  result of a malfunction or breakdown of such equipment or as a result
      of a malfunction  or  breakdown  of  the  apparatus  which  serves  such
      equipment,  the  commissioner may require the owner of such equipment to
      file with the  department  an  acceptable  emergency  action  plan.  The
      emergency  action  plan  shall detail all activity that will be taken to
      prevent or control emissions resulting from a malfunction or breakdown.
    
    
    
    
    
    
    

Section 24-153
--------------

Section 24-153 ::    
        
     
        §  24-153  Emissions  of  air  contaminant;  environmental ratings. No
      person shall cause, permit or allow the emission of air contaminant from
      any equipment altered or  installed  after  August  twentieth,  nineteen
      hundred  seventy-one,  which  exceeds  the  permissible  emission  rates
      specified  in  figures  one,  two,  three,  four  and  five,   for   the
      environmental  rating as determined in accordance with table one of this
      section.
        (a) On October first, nineteen hundred seventy-one, or such later date
      as established by an order of the commissioner the permissible  emission
      rates  specified in this section shall become applicable to equipment in
      existence on or prior to August twentieth, nineteen hundred seventy-one.
        (b) The provisions of this section shall not be construed to allow  or
      permit  any  person to emit air contaminant in quantities which alone or
      in combination with other  sources  would  contravene  any  air  quality
      standards.
        (c) This section shall be supplemental to all other provisions of this
      code  and  in  the  event  of  conflict the more stringent section shall
      control.
     
                       TABLE 1 - Environmental Rating Criteria
     
        Rating
        A. Includes processes, and exhaust and ventilation systems  where  the
      discharge of air contaminant results, or would reasonably be expected to
      result,  in  serious  adverse  effects  on receptors or the environment.
      These effects may be of a health, economic or aesthetic  nature  or  any
      combination of these.
        B.  Includes  processes, and exhaust and ventilation systems where the
      discharge of contaminant results, or would  reasonably  be  expected  to
      result, in only moderate and essentially localized effects; or where the
      multiplicity  of sources of the contaminant in any given area is such as
      to require an overall  reduction  of  the  atmospheric  burden  of  that
      contaminant.
        C.  Includes  processes, and exhaust and ventilation systems where the
      discharge of contaminant would  reasonably  be  expected  to  result  in
      localized adverse effects of an aesthetic or nuisance nature.
        D.  Includes  processes, and exhaust and ventilation systems where, in
      view  of  properties  and  concentrations  of  the  emissions,  isolated
      conditions,  stack  heights,  and  other  factors,  it  can  be  clearly
      demonstrated that discharge of contaminant will not result in measurable
      or observable effects on  receptors  and  not  add  to  an  existing  or
      predictable   atmospheric   burden   of  that  contaminant  which  would
      reasonably be expected to cause adverse effects.
        The following items will be considered in making  a  determination  of
      the environmental rating to be applied to a particular source:
        (a) properties, quantities and rates of the emissions;
        (b) physical surroundings of emission source;
        (c)  population  density  of  surrounding  area, including anticipated
      future growth;
        (d) dispersion characteristics at or near source;
        (e)  location  of  emission  source  relative  to  ground  level   and
      surrounding buildings, hills, and other features of the terrain;
        (f) current or anticipated ambient air quality in vicinity of source;
        (g) latest findings relating to effects of ground-level concentrations
      of the emissions on receptors;
        (h)  possible  hazardous  side  effects of air contaminant in question
      mixing with air contaminants already in ambient air; and
        (i) engineering guides which are acceptable to the commissioner.

        (1) Where multiple emission sources are  connected  to  a  common  air
      cleaning  device, the degree of air cleaning required will be that which
      would be required if each individual  emission  source  were  considered
      separately.
        (2)  For an average emission rate potential less than 1.0 lb./hr., the
      desired air cleaning efficiency shall  be  determined  by  the  expected
      concentration of the air contaminant in the emission stream. Where it is
      uneconomical  to  employ  air cleaning devices, other methods of control
      should be considered.
