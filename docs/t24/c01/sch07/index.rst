      paragraph  one  or  paragraph  three of subdivision k of this section, a
      city agency or contractor shall  primarily  consider  the  reduction  in
      emissions  of  particulate matter and secondarily consider the reduction
      in emissions  of  nitrogen  oxides  associated  with  the  use  of  such
    
      technology,  which  shall  in  no  event  result  in  an increase in the
      emissions of either such pollutant.
        m.  Any  finding or waiver made or issued pursuant to paragraph one or
      paragraph three of subdivision k of this section shall expire after  one
      hundred  eighty days, at which time the requirements of paragraph two of
      subdivision b and paragraph two of subdivision c of this  section  shall
      be  in  full force and effect unless the city agency renews the finding,
      in writing, and the commissioner approves such finding, in  writing,  or
      the commissioner renews the waiver, in writing.
        n.  Any  contractor who violates any provision of this section, except
      as provided in subdivision o of this section,  shall  be  liable  for  a
      civil  penalty  between  the  amounts  of  one thousand and ten thousand
      dollars, in addition  to  twice  the  amount  of  money  saved  by  such
      contractor for failure to comply with this section.
        o.  No  contractor  shall  make  a  false  claim  with  respect to the
      provisions of this section to a city agency. Where a contractor has been
      found to have done so, such contractor  shall  be  liable  for  a  civil
      penalty  of  twenty thousand dollars, in addition to twice the amount of
      money saved by such contractor in  association  with  having  made  such
      false claim.
        p.  This  section shall not apply to any public works contract entered
      into or renewed prior to the effective date of this section.
        q. Nothing in this section shall be  construed  to  limit  the  city's
