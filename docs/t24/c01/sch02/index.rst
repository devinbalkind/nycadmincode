      necessary,  the  commissioner  may  order  the owner to provide sampling
      holes at such points in the stack, conduit, flue, duct or vent,  as  the
      commissioner  may reasonably request, to provide a power source suitable
      to the points of testing, and to provide allied facilities, exclusive of
      sampling and sensory devices. These provisions  shall  be  made  at  the
      expense of the owner of the equipment. The owner shall be furnished with

Section 24-110
--------------

Section 24-110 ::    
        
     
        §   24-110  Variances.  (a)  The  commissioner  may  grant  individual
      variances, except  to  governmental  agencies,  beyond  the  limitations
      prescribed  by  this  code,  whenever  it is found, upon presentation of
      adequate proof, that compliance with any provision of this code, or with
      any regulation or order of the commissioner  in  respect  to  this  code
      would   impose   unreasonable  hardship.  In  granting  a  variance  the
      commissioner may impose such conditions as the policies of this code may
      require and shall publish in the City Record no later  than  seven  days
      after the granting of such variance a written opinion, stating the facts
      and reasons leading to his or her decision.
        (b) Any variance granted pursuant to this section shall be granted for
      such  period of time, not to exceed six months, as shall be specified by
      the commissioner at the time of the grant of such variance and upon  the
      condition  that  the  person  who receives such variance shall make such
      periodic progress  reports  as  the  commissioner  shall  specify.  Such
      variance  may  be  extended  for  periods  not  to  exceed six months by
      affirmative  action  of  the  commissioner,  but  only  if  satisfactory
      progress has been shown.
        (c) Any person seeking a variance shall do so by filing a petition for
      variance  in  a  form  acceptable  to the commissioner. The commissioner
      shall promptly give written notice of such petition to any person in the
      city who has in writing requested  notice  of  variance  petitions,  and
      shall  publish  notice  of  such  petition  in  the  City Record. If the
      commissioner, in his or her discretion, concludes that a  hearing  would
      be advisable, or if any person files a written objection to the grant of
      such  variance  within twenty-one days from the publication of notice in
      the City Record, then a public hearing shall be held.
        (d) The commissioner may grant individual or  group  variances  beyond
      the  sulfur  content  restriction  prescribed  by section 24-169 of this
      code, whenever it is found, upon presentation of  adequate  proof,  that
      the  supply of fuel oil is insufficient to meet the demands of residents
      of the city of New York for heat, hot water, and electrical power. Where
      an applicant can show that it has an insufficient reserve  of  fuel  oil
      meeting  the  sulfur  content  requirements  of this code and that it is
      unable to buy a sufficient amount of such fuel oil to meet its fuel  oil
      demands   during   the   pendency   of  its  variance  application,  the
      commissioner may grant a variance for  up  to  forty-five  days  without
      complying  with  the  procedural requirement of this section, except for
      the publication requirement of subdivision (a). During the time in which
      a temporary variance is running, the commissioner shall review, as  soon
      as  practicable, the application for a variance treating it as any other
      variance application.
        (e) With respect to a variance  for  the  spraying  of  any  substance
      containing  asbestos in or upon a building or other structure during its
      construction, alteration or repair the commissioner shall in determining
      undue hardship take cognizance that  such  construction,  alteration  or
      repair  was  commenced  or  a  permit  has  been granted for same by the
      department of buildings prior  to  August  twentieth,  nineteen  hundred
      seventy-one  or  six  months  thereafter  and  that a non-asbestos spray
      material has not been approved for fireproof purposes by the  department
      of buildings.

      department as to any matter within the jurisdiction of the department.
        (b) No person shall make, reproduce or alter  or  cause  to  be  made,

        §  24-114  Enforcement  of  this  code by other than compulsory means.

      means. However, such non-compulsory methods  need  not  be  used  before
      proceeding by way of compulsory enforcement.
