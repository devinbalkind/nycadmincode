      institute  a  pilot  program  to  use  greater  amounts  of biodiesel in
      city-owned buildings. Such pilot program shall  require  that  beginning
      October first, two thousand fourteen, the heating oil burned in not less
      than  five  percent  of  city-owned buildings shall contain at least ten
