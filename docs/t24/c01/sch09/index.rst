        (ii) Impose a separate penalty for each day on which a violation under
      this code shall have occurred.
        (iii)  Remit,  in  whole  or  in  part,  such civil penalty if, at the
      conclusion of the hearing, or at the time  of  the  board  determination
      under section 24-187 of this code, or at the date on which a stipulation
      is  executed  by the parties in settlement of the proceeding pursuant to
      section 24-183 of this code, the respondent is no longer in violation of
      a provision of this code or of any order, rule or regulation promulgated
      thereunder  and  is  not  in  default  under  section  24-185  of   this
      subchapter.
        (iv) Impose an additional civil penalty, in the amount of ten per cent
      (10%) of the penalty originally imposed, for late payment of penalty for
      each month or part thereof that the penalty payment is in arrears. In no
      event  shall  the  total additional civil penalty exceed the maximum set
      forth in the table of civil penalties or schedules E, F and G  of  civil
      penalties for equipment requiring operating certificates, or as modified
      pursuant to paragraph six of subdivision (b) of this section.
        (v) Remit in whole or in part, such civil penalty at the conclusion of
      the  hearing,  or  at  a  date on which a stipulation is executed by the
      parties in proceedings pursuant to section 24-183 of  this  chapter,  if
      the  respondent  was  in  violation  of  this code through the action or
      inaction of an agency of the city of New York and not through the action
      or inaction of the respondent.
        (6) Order any person to be classified as a persistent violator if such
      person is found to be in violation of this code and has also on  one  or
      more prior occasions within the preceding five years been found to be in
      violation   of  this  code,  where  such  repeated  violations  evidence
    
      substantial disregard thereof. If a person is classified as a persistent
      violator, the board shall in each instance  double  the  amount  of  the
      penalty  which  it  would otherwise impose pursuant to paragraph five of
      this  subdivision. Such double penalties shall be imposed for violations
      which the board finds a person committed pursuant to the same proceeding
      at which it classified such person as a persistent violator and for  all
      violations  committed  within  the  two years immediately following such
      classification,  after  which  such  classification   shall   terminate.
      However,  if  at the end of such two year period such person is still in
      violation of this code because of  a  failure  to  take  or  complete  a
      corrective  action  as  required by the board, such classification shall
      continue until such time as such person is no  longer  in  violation  of
      this  code  because  of  such failure, at which time such classification
      shall cease. Thereafter, the board may again classify such person  as  a
      persistent violator, on the same basis it used originally.
        (7)  Impose a civil penalty of not more than two hundred fifty dollars
      on any owner of equipment for each day such equipment is sealed pursuant
      to this section;
        (8) Impose a civil penalty of not less than one thousand nor more than
      four thousand dollars on any person who willfully breaks, or  causes  or
      permits  the  breaking  of,  a seal placed on equipment pursuant to this
      section.
        (9) Order any person or the commissioner to install any  apparatus  or
      to clean, repair or alter any equipment or apparatus which causes, or is
      maintained or operated so as to cause, a violation of this code.
        (c)  The  board  may,  upon  notice pursuant to section 24-180 of this
      code, order any person to:
        (1) Cease and desist from the installation or alteration of  equipment
      or  apparatus,  without  a  permit as required by section 24-120 of this
      code;
        (2) Cease and desist from the operation of any equipment or  apparatus
      without  a certificate and the board may also seal any such equipment or
      apparatus;
        (3) Cease and desist from the spraying of insulating material  on,  or
      the  demolition  of, any building or structure which does not conform to
      the requirements of section 24-109 or 24-146 of this code. The board may
      also seal any equipment used therefor.
        (d) The board may order the commissioner to install any  apparatus  or
      to clean, repair, or alter any equipment or apparatus which causes or is
      maintained  or  operated  so  as to cause a violation of an order issued
      pursuant to paragraph two of subdivision (b) of this section, where such
      installation, cleaning,  repairing,  or  alteration  can  reasonably  be
      expected  to  correct  such a violation. Any work required under such an
      order may be executed by the commissioner through the  officers,  agents
      or  contractors  of  the  department. The department shall be reimbursed
      promptly for all costs and expenses of such work by  the  owner  of  the
      equipment  or  apparatus  to  which  the order relates and in respect to
      which such expenses were incurred. Such expenses may be recovered  in  a
      civil action brought in the name of the commissioner.
        (e)  If  an order of the board issued pursuant to subdivisions (b) and
      (c) of this section provides for a period of time during which a  person
      subject  to the order is permitted to correct a violation, the board may
      require the respondent to post a performance bond or other security with
      the department in a form and amount sufficient to assure the  correction
      of  such violation within the prescribed time. In the event of a failure
      to meet the schedule prescribed by the board, the sum named in the  bond
      or  other  security  shall  be  forfeited  and  shall  be  paid  to  the
      commissioner.
    
        (f) The board may order  any  person  to  cease  and  desist  from  an
      activity  which  it  reasonably  believes  causes  an emission of an air
      contaminant which creates an imminent peril to the public  health.  Such
      order  shall  be  effective  upon service thereof. Any party affected by
      such  an  order  may  request a hearing on written notice, and he or she
      shall be afforded a hearing, within twenty-four hours after  service  of
      such  request,  pursuant  to  section  24-184  of  this code. If such an
      accelerated hearing is not requested, then a hearing shall  be  afforded
      within  ten days of the issuance of the order. The board shall issue its
      final decision and order thereon within three days from  the  conclusion
      of a hearing held pursuant to this subsection.

      of violation issued and served on:
        (1) The person in violation; or
        (2) An owner with an equity interest in the equipment in violation; or

      cannot be located with due diligence, any other owner of said equipment.

      proceeds,  for  disclosure  of  information  or  evidence,  not  in  the

      the department, which leads to the imposition of the civil penalty.
        (e) In any proceeding brought by a complainant pursuant to subdivision
      (a)  of  this  section,  the  board  shall  award,  out  of the proceeds
      collected, fifty percent of any civil penalty  as  fair  and  reasonable
