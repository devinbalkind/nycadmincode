Section 24-406 ::    
        
     
        *  §  24-406  Removal  of  electric wires; Manhattan and the Bronx. a.
      After the grade of any street in the boroughs of Manhattan and the Bronx
      shall have been finally determined and  established,  whenever,  in  the
      opinion  of  the board of estimate it shall be practicable to remove the
      electrical conductors  above  ground  in  such  street  and  place  them
      underground,  the commissioner of transportation shall notify the owners
      or operators of such conductors. Notice shall be to the effect that such
      electrical conductors must be removed within a certain time,  sufficient
      for removal, which shall be fixed by such commissioner. In the case of a
      corporation  duly  authorized  to  lay and operate electrical conductors
      underground in such street, the time shall be sufficient for the  proper
      laying  of  conductors  underground  in  place  of those removed. b. All
      electrical conductors authorized to be placed underground, shall  be  so
      placed  under  and  in accordance with the provisions of sections 24-410
      through 24-415 of the code. Whenever application shall be  made  to  the
      commissioner  of  transportation  for  permission  to  place underground
      electrical conductors in any such street, if such permission be granted,
      the  subways  therefor  shall  be  constructed  or  provided,  and  such
      electrical  conductors  placed  underground under and in accordance with
      the provisions of such sections. Such permission shall be  granted  only
      in accordance with the provisions of such sections.

Section 24-407 ::    
        
     
        * § 24-407 Underground electrical conductors; Manhattan and the Bronx.
      Any  company, operating or intending to operate electrical conductors in
      the boroughs of Manhattan and the  Bronx,  if  it  shall  desire  or  be
      required  to  place  its conductors or any of them underground in any of
      the streets of such boroughs,  must  remove  such  conductors  from  the
      surface  of  such  streets,  when  duly authorized so to do. It shall be
      obligatory  upon  such  company  to  file  with  the   commissioner   of
      transportation  a  map or maps, made to scale, showing the streets which
      are desired to  be  used  for  such  purpose,  and  giving  the  general
      location,  dimensions  and course of the underground conduits desired to
      be constructed. Before any such conduits shall be constructed, it  shall
      be   necessary   to   obtain   the  approval  of  such  commissioner  of
      transportation of the plan of construction proposed by such company. The
      commissioner of transportation has and shall have power to require  that
      the work of removal and of constructing every such system of underground
      conductors  shall be done according to such plan so approved, subject at
      all times to such modifications as shall be made by him or her from time
      to time, and subject also to  such  rules  and  regulations  as  may  be
      promulgated by him.

Section 24-408
--------------

Section 24-408 ::    
        
     
        *  §  24-408 Electrical conductors; Manhattan and the Bronx; duties of
      commissioner  of  transportation.  a.  It  shall  be  the  duty  of  the
      commissioner  of  transportation  to  carefully  investigate any and all
      methods proposed by any company  for  electric  lighting  or  electrical
      communication by the use of conductors along or across any street in the
      boroughs  of  Manhattan and the Bronx, and, before approving of any such
      method, such commissioner of transportation shall require that,  so  far
      as   practicable,   all   such  conductors  when  constructed  shall  be
      underground.  The  commissioner  of  transportation  shall   have   full
      authority  to  compel  all companies operating electric wires to use the
      subway prepared in accordance with the  provisions  of  sections  24-407
      through 24-409 of the code.
        b.  Wherever,  along  the streets, in sparsely inhabited or unoccupied
      portions of such boroughs, the  public  interests  do  not  require  the
      electrical  conductors  to  be  placed underground, and wherever, in any
      other locality in such boroughs, it is deemed by  such  commissioner  to
      be,  for  any cause, impracticable to construct and successfully operate
      underground the electrical conductors  required  by  any  such  company,
      then, it shall be the duty of such commissioner to examine and grant the
      application  of  any  such  company  for permission to deviate from such
      underground  system.  The  commissioner  of  transportation  shall  not,
      however,  grant any such permission unless he or she shall be satisfied,
      upon investigation, that such a permit should be granted for one of  the
      reasons stated above, and that it will not interfere with the successful
      working  of  underground conductors elsewhere in such boroughs. Any such
      permit shall be held and construed to  authorize  the  construction  and
      maintenance  of  the  lines  of  conductors therein provided for, as and
      where prescribed by the commissioner of transportation.
        c. It is hereby made the duty of such commissioner of  transportation,
      in  granting  any  such  permit  for  other  than underground electrical
      connections, to bear in mind the policy and purpose of  sections  24-407
      through  24-409 of the code, which is to convert the overhead systems of
      electrical wires and cables now in use in such boroughs  to  underground
      systems,  as soon as possible, without impairing the efficiency of their
      service, and to require that, as  far  as  practicable,  all  electrical
      conductors  in  any  street  in  such boroughs shall be removed from the
      surface  and  placed  and  operated  underground,  as  soon  as  may  be
      consistent with the convenient use thereof by the public. It is intended
      to authorize other than underground electrical conductors, to be used in
      the streets, only when and where the public interests do not require the
      electrical  conductors  to  be  placed underground, or when and where it
      shall be deemed by the board of estimate to be  impracticable  to  place
      and  operate  the  conductors  advantageously  underground.  It  is also
      intended to make all  aerial  or  other  electrical  connections  merely
      incidental  to  such  underground  methods,  and to require that they be
      authorized only when and where needed for  the  convenient  use  of  the
      public  or  where  the  underground  conductors  can be made more useful
      thereby.
        d. The work of constructing every line of conductors authorized by any
      such permit, so granted, shall be subject to the rules  and  regulations
      prescribed  by  the  commissioner  of  transportation. Every such permit
      shall specify the location of the structures to be  erected  and  to  be
      used  for  sustaining  the  electrical  conductors,  and  shall give the
      general dimensions thereof.
        e. It shall be the duty  of  the  commissioner  of  transportation  to
      require  that  the subway may be used by the city for the electric wires
      or conductors operated by its police, fire  or  other  agencies  without
      expense,  except  that  of  the wires or conductors. The city shall not,
    
      however, be compelled to place any such wires or conductors  underground
      until  the  money  has been specifically raised therefor, and until that
      time the city may continue to use and extend such wires.

Section 24-409
--------------

Section 24-409 ::    
        
     
        * § 24-409 Aerial electrical wires or cables; regulation. Whenever the
      commissioner  of transportation shall permit any aerial electrical wires
      or cables, carried along or across and above the surface of any  of  the
      streets  of  such  boroughs, to be crossed by aerial electrical wires or
      cables, it shall be the duty of the commissioner  of  transportation  to
      designate  also,  in such permit, the route and location thereof, and to
      prescribe and regulate the height at which such wires or cables shall be
      placed. Whenever any such permit shall be granted by the commissioner of
      transportation,  in  extending  the  connections  of  any   subterranean
      electrical  conductors,  for the erection of any structure or structures
      for sustaining electrical conductors above the surface of any street, or
      for placing wires or cables on any  such  structure  or  elsewhere  than
      underground,  or  for  carrying any such wires or cables across or along
      and above the surface of any street, or for placing wires or  cables  on
      any  such  structure  or elsewhere than underground, or for carrying any
      such wires or cables over or into or in the rear of any building in such
      boroughs, any and all such structures, and any and  all  such  wires  or
      cables,  shall be so erected and maintained as not to interfere with the
      other public uses of such streets.

      Whenever, in the  opinion  of  the  commissioner  of  transportation,  a
      sufficient  construction  of  conduits  or subways under ground shall be
      made ready under the provisions of sections 24-410 through 24-414 of the
      code, in any street or locality in the boroughs  of  Manhattan  and  the
      Bronx,  reference being had to the general direction and vicinity of the
      electrical  conductors  then  in  use  overhead,  the  commissioner   of
      transportation  shall  notify  the owners or operators of the electrical
      conductors above ground in such street or  locality.  The  notice  shall
      inform  them  that  they are to make such electrical connections in such
      street or through other streets, localities or parts  of  such  boroughs
      with such underground conduits or subways as shall be determined by such
      commissioner  of  transportation,  and  to remove poles, wires, or other
      electrical conductors above ground  and  their  supporting  fixtures  or
      other  devices  from  such  street and locality within ninety days after
      notice to such effect shall be given.

        §  24-411  Removal of abandoned poles. a. All telegraph, telephone and
      electric light poles, wires or conductors which shall  hereafter  remain
      or  stand  disused,  or become disused or abandoned, in, or over or upon
      any street, shall be forthwith removed, but for sufficient  cause  shown
      the commissioner of transportation may extend the time for such removal,
      by one or more orders, for periods not exceeding one year each.
        b. The persons owning, operating, managing or controlling poles, wires
      or  appurtenances  which may have been so disused or abandoned, or which
      may be dangerous or unsafe, shall take down and remove  them,  and  upon
      their  failure to do so, the commissioner of design and construction, in
      accordance with chapter fifty-five  of  the  charter,  unless  otherwise
      directed  by  the  mayor pursuant to such chapter, shall remove the same
      forthwith, at the expense of such  persons.  Before  such  removal,  the
      commissioner  of  transportation  or  the  commissioner  of  design  and
      construction, except where a condition of danger exists,  shall  mail  a
      notice  thereof  to  the  last  known address of such persons, a copy of
      which shall be posted for a period of ten days on  each  of  such  poles
      prior to its removal.
        c.  Any  person  convicted  of a violation of any of the provisions of
      this section shall be punished by a fine of not less  than  two  hundred
      fifty nor more than five hundred dollars, imprisonment for not more than

      security. a. The commissioner of transportation shall not grant a permit
      of the type mentioned in section 24-404  of  the  code  unless,  if  the
      application be for underground construction, there is an existing demand
      for  the construction of such conduits or subways, and the occupation of
      such conduits or subways is reasonably assured, and the public interests
      require their  construction,  or  unless,  if  the  application  be  for
      permission  to  deviate  from  an underground system, the case is one of
      those in which such deviation may be legally permitted  under  authority
      of  sections  24-407  through 24-409 of the code. This section is made a

      interested,  shall deem it desirable and practicable that the electrical
      conductors above ground in any  street  in  the  boroughs  of  Brooklyn,
      Queens   and  Richmond,  be  placed  underground,  the  commissioner  of
      transportation shall notify the owners or operators of  such  electrical
      conductors.  The  notice  shall  be  to  the effect that such electrical
      conductors shall be placed underground within a certain time, sufficient
      for the proper construction of underground conduits or other channels in
      such street, to  be  fixed  by  such  commissioner.  Whenever  any  duly
      authorized   company   operating  or  intending  to  operate  electrical
      conductors in any such street, shall desire to place its  conductors  or
      any  of  them  underground,  it shall be obligatory upon such company to
      file with the commissioner of transportation a map or  maps  made  to  a
      scale,  showing  the  streets  which  are  desired  to  be used for such
      purpose, and giving the general location, dimensions and course  of  the
      underground  conduit  desired to be constructed. Before any such conduit
      shall be constructed it shall be necessary to obtain the approval of the
      commissioner of transportation of such plan of construction so proposed,
      and such commissioner shall have power  to  require  that  the  work  of
