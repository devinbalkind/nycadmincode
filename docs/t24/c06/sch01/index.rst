        ยง 24-602 Declaration of policy. It is hereby declared to be the public
      policy  of  the  city  to  respond  to emergencies caused by releases or
      threatened releases of hazardous substances into the environment  so  as
      to  preserve, protect and improve the public health, safety and welfare,
      and to prevent injury to human, plant and animal life and  property.  It
      is  the  policy  of  the  city  that  every  person  is  entitled  to an
      environment free of hazardous substances that are detrimental  to  life,
      health,  and  enjoyment  of  property.  It  is  hereby declared that the
      release  or  threat  of  release  of  hazardous  substances   into   the
      environment  is a menace to the health, safety and welfare of the people
      of the city and may cause extensive damage to  the  environment  and  to
      property.  This chapter shall be liberally construed so as to effectuate
      the  purposes  described  in  this  section.  Nothing  herein  shall  be
      construed to abridge the powers of the board of health or the department
      of  health  and  mental  hygiene  to  engage  in any of their authorized
      activities.
