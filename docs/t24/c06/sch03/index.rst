--------------

Section 24-608 ::    
        
     
        §  24-608  Emergency  response. a. When the commissioner has reason to
      believe that there has been a release  or  there  exists  a  substantial
      threat  of a release into the environment of a hazardous substance which
      may present an immediate and substantial danger to the public health  or
      welfare  or  the  environment,  the  commissioner  may,  in  his  or her
      discretion, order any  or  all  responsible  persons  to  implement  any
      response  measures,  or to cooperate with and assist the commissioner in
      implementing any response measures, deemed by  the  commissioner  to  be
      necessary  to  protect  the public health or welfare or the environment,
      or, if the commissioner, in the  exercise  of  his  or  her  discretion,
      concludes  that seeking the implementation of any such response measures
      by a responsible person may be detrimental to public health  or  welfare
      or the environment due to the likelihood of delay or the ineffectiveness
      of  such  response  measures,  or  for any other appropriate reason, the
      commissioner may implement  such  response  measures.  The  commissioner
      shall,  where  appropriate, consult with the commissioner of health, the
      police commissioner and the fire commissioner concerning  the  need  for
      and   implementation   of   such   response  measures  and  orders.  The
      commissioner may also order the production  of  documents  relevant  for
      determining the nature and extent of the release or threat of release.
        b.  Nothing  in  this  subchapter  shall  be construed to preclude the
      implementation of response measures by any  other  city  agency,  either
      prior  or  subsequent  to  any  response measure implemented pursuant to
      subdivision a of this section.

      The  commissioner shall consider whether any of the following substances
      shall be included on such list: (1) the extremely  hazardous  substances

      and (5) the hazardous materials designated  pursuant  to  the  hazardous
      materials transportation act, as amended.
        b.   The   commissioner   may  promulgate  regulations  requiring  any
      responsible person who knows or has reason to know of any release  of  a
      listed  hazardous substance to immediately notify the commissioner. Such
      regulations shall establish the minimum quantity of any listed hazardous
      substance the release of which shall be reported to the commissioner and
      shall set forth the form and manner  of  any  notification  required.  A
      knowing  failure  to  comply with such notification requirement shall be
      punishable by a fine of not more than twenty-five thousand  dollars,  to
      be  recovered  in a civil action brought in the name of the commissioner

      and imprisonment.
        a. (1) An order of the commissioner issued pursuant to  subdivision  a
      of section 24-608 shall specify the work to be performed and shall fix a
      reasonable  time  for compliance from the date of service of such order.
      Such  order  shall  contain  a  statement  that  upon  failure  of   the
      responsible  person  to  comply with the commissioner's order within the
      stated time, the department may perform the work specified in the  order
      or  apply  for  a court order directing the responsible person to comply
      with the commissioner's order.
        (2) (i) Service of such order  shall  be  made  upon  the  responsible
      person  personally  or  by certified or registered mail addressed to the
      last known address of such person or in any manner provided for  service
      of process by article three of the civil practice law and rules.
        (ii)  In  instances  where the commissioner knows that the responsible
      person served pursuant to subparagraph (i) of this paragraph is not  the
      owner  of  the property at which the response measures ordered are to be
      implemented, notice that such order has been served, and a copy of  such
      order,  shall  be  sent  by  both certified or registered mail and first
      class mail to the last known address of the person whose name appears on
      the records in the office of the city collector as being  the  owner  or
      agent  or as the person designated by the owner to receive tax bills or,
      where no name appears, to such property, addressed to either  the  owner
      or  the  agent.  Such  notice  shall  have  stamped or printed thereon a
      reference to this section. Any failure  to  provide  written  notice  as
      prescribed  by  this  subparagraph  shall  not  in  any  way  affect the
      liability of any person for the  cost  incurred  by  the  city  for  any
      response measures implemented in accordance with this chapter.
        (3)  A  copy  of  such  order  shall  be  filed with the office of the
      register in the county in which is situated the property with respect to
      which such order was issued.
        (4) After service of such order upon a responsible person, such person
      may request a hearing, except in  circumstances  of  imminent  peril  in
      which  the  commissioner has determined that response measures are to be
      implemented without any delay. The commissioner shall  promulgate  rules
      and  regulations setting forth the times within which and the procedures
      by which requests for hearings shall be made and hearings shall be held.
      At such hearing  the  responsible  persons,  shall  be  entitled  to  be
      represented  by  counsel  and  to present evidence. The commissioner may
      affirm, modify or revoke the order.
        b.  In  addition  to  any  response  measures   implemented   by   the
      commissioner pursuant to section 24-608, if the responsible person fails
      to  comply  with  the  commissioner's  order  within  the time fixed for
      compliance pursuant to subdivision a of this section, the department may
      perform the work specified in the order, or may apply to  any  court  of
      competent jurisdiction, upon such notice and in such manner as the court
      shall  direct,  for  an order directing the responsible person to comply
      with the commissioner's order.
        c. Any responsible person  who  without  sufficient  cause,  willfully
      violates,  or  fails  or  refuses  to  comply  with,  any  order  of the
      commissioner issued pursuant to section 24-608 may be liable: (1) for  a
      civil  penalty  of  not  more  than ten thousand dollars for each day in
      which such violation  occurs  or  such  failure  or  refusal  to  comply
      continues; and (2) for an additional civil penalty in an amount at least
      equal  to,  and  not  more  than  three  times,  the amount of any costs
      incurred by the city as a result of such person's willful violation,  or
      failure or refusal to comply. Such penalties may be recovered in a civil
    
      action brought in the name of the commissioner or in a proceeding before
      the environmental control board.
        d.  In  addition  to  the penalties set forth in subdivision c of this
      section and subdivision b of section 24-609, any  person  who  knowingly
      violates or fails to comply with any order, rule or regulation issued by
      the  commissioner  pursuant  to  this  chapter  shall  be  guilty  of  a
      misdemeanor and, upon conviction thereof, shall be punishable by a  fine
      of not less than twenty-five thousand dollars, or by imprisonment not to
