      provided  for  in such agreement. The town board of any such town or the
      municipal authorities of any such village are  likewise  authorized  and
      empowered  to  enter  into  such  agreement.  They  may  provide in such
      contract or agreement that all persons within the area  affected  owning
      buildings  on  streets where sewers are, or may hereafter be constructed
      or located under such agreement,  or  any  modification  thereof,  shall
      connect  with  the  sewer  systems  as  provided  in  such  contract  or
      agreement.
        2. In the event of the failure  of  any  such  person  or  persons  to
      connect  with  any sewer system and the failure of the town board of any
      such town or the municipal authorities of any  such  village  to  compel

      village  or  the town board of any such town are likewise authorized and
      empowered to enter into such agreements with the city.
        2. When a sewerage system shall have been constructed, the city  shall
      lay  and  thereafter  maintain  such pipes as may be necessary from such
      sewerage system to the outside of  the  foundation  walls  of  buildings
      containing  water-using  sanitary plumbing. The cost of such pipes shall
      be paid by the city and in all cases where such pipes are  so  laid  the
      owner  shall  make  no  claim  for  damage  for such entry on his or her
      property unless the city shall have failed  to  replace  and  leave  the

      have laid the necessary pipes from such system to  the  outside  of  the
      foundation   wall   of  any  building  containing  water-using  sanitary
      plumbing, the owner of  such  building  shall  cause  the  drainage  and
      sewerage  of such building to be connected with and discharged into such
      pipes.

      construct, maintain and operate such sewer and disposal works. Where the
      route  of  such  sewer follows any state highway, county highway or town
      road, such highway or road shall be replaced and repaired by the city to
      the satisfaction of the department, body or official having jurisdiction
      thereover.
        c. Notwithstanding any provision of any general, special or local  law
      or  of  any  charter,  the  commissioner  of environmental protection is
      hereby authorized and empowered to enter into a contract  or  agreement,
      subject  to  the  approval  of the mayor, with the governing body of the

      apportion the cost of construction, according to actual benefit, between
      the several parcels of property abutting on each side of  that  part  of
      the street through which the sewer is to be constructed.
        c.  Until  title  to  such  sewer  vests  in  the city of New York, as
      hereinafter provided, the commissioner of environmental protection shall

      parties who constructed and paid for such sewer, shall have the right to
      connect with such sewer without payment of any  part  of  the  cost  and
      expense of such sewer.
        d.  Except  for the purpose of supervision, maintenance and use by the
      city in connection with its public sewer system,  such  sewer  shall  be
      deemed  the private property of the parties or party who shall have paid
      for its construction. When the owners of all the  property  abutting  on
      that part of the street in which any such sewer has been laid shall have
      paid  their  several  shares  of the cost of its construction, or when a
      period of seven years from the time of issuance of the  permit  pursuant
      to  subdivision  a hereof has elasped, whichever is earlier, it shall be
      the property of the city. The city in no event shall be liable  for  any
      part of the cost and expense of construction of any such sewer.
        e. It shall be unlawful for any person to represent to any prospective
      purchaser  of  property that a sewer constructed in any street is a city
      sewer unless such sewer shall have  been  constructed  by  the  city  in
      accordance  with  the  legally  adopted drainage plan of the city and/or
      accepted as a public sewer in accordance  with  the  provisions  of  the

      or her satisfaction that the proposed discharges to the sewer will be in
      compliance  with  section  24-523  of  this  chapter and the regulations
      promulgated pursuant to such section. For such purpose the  commissioner
      issuing  the  permit may require the submission of plans, specifications
      and such other information as he or she may reasonably require.

      or sewer riser. a. As used in this section:
        1.  The term "agency having jurisdiction" shall mean the department of
      environmental protection.
        2. The term "curb-to-sewer connection" shall mean the connection  from
      the  curb  line  to  the  sewer or to a sewer riser constructed with the
      sewer.
        3. The term "cost" shall mean the actual  cost  of  constructing  each
      sewer-to-curb connection.
        4.  The  term "curb line" shall mean the curb line determined pursuant
      to the resolution of the  board  of  estimate  establishing  street  and
      roadway widths.
        b.  The  owner of any parcel of real property to be connected with the
      sewer system shall pay the cost of each curb-to-sewer connection serving
      such real property, if such curb-to-sewer connection  was  or  shall  be
      constructed  in  connection  with  the  construction,  reconstruction or
      replacement of a sewer  duly  authorized  on  or  after  January  first,
      nineteen  hundred  sixty-two. Such cost shall become due and payable and
      shall constitute a lien against such property when  the  amount  thereof
      shall  have been computed by the agency having jurisdiction and an entry
      thereof shall have been made against such premises in the office of  the
      city   collector   in  the  book  in  which  charges  for  curb-to-sewer
      connections are to be entered. A notice thereof, stating the amount  due
      and  the  nature  of  the  charge shall be mailed by the city collector,
      within five days after such entry, to the  last  known  address  of  the
      person  whose  name  appears  upon the records in the office of the city
      collector as being the person designated by the  owner  to  receive  tax
      bills  or where no name appears, to the premises addressed to either the
      owner or the agent, together with a statement that if such charge is not
      paid within ninety days from the date of entry the amount  thereof  with
      interest  thereon  at  the  rate  of  seven  percent  per  annum,  to be
      calculated to  the  date  of  payment  from  the  date  of  entry,  will
      constitute, until paid, a lien against the premises which shall be prior
      and superior to every other lien or claim except the lien of an existing
      tax,  water  rent,  sewer  rent, sewer surcharge or local assessment. If
      such charge is not paid within ninety days from the date  of  entry,  it
      shall  be the duty of the city collector to collect and receive interest
      thereon at the rate of seven percent per annum, to be calculated to  the
      date  of  payment  from  the date of entry. Such charge and the interest
      thereon shall continue to be, until paid, a lien on the premises  served
      by  such  curb-to-sewer  connection.  Such  charge and interest shall be
      calculated and the lien thereof may be foreclosed in the manner provided
      by law for the collection and foreclosure of the lien  of  taxes,  sewer
      rents, sewer surcharges and water rents due and payable to the city, and
      the  provisions of the code applicable to the collection and foreclosure
      of the lien of such taxes, sewer rents, sewer surcharges and water rents
      shall apply to such  charge  and  the  interest  thereon  and  the  lien
      thereof.  Such  lien  shall be prior and superior to every other lien or
      claim except the lien of an existing tax, water rent, sewer rent,  sewer
      surcharge,  or local assessment. The provisions of section 11-307 of the
      code applicable to the payment of assessments shall also  apply  to  the
      charge established pursuant to this section.
        c.  Nothing contained in this section shall affect, impair or diminish
      the duty, obligation and responsibility of the owner  of  real  property
      connected  with the sewer system at his or her own cost and expense: (1)
      to maintain any curb-to-sewer connection serving such real property; and
      (2) to repair, reconstruct  or  replace  such  curb-to-sewer  connection
      except when the necessity for such repair, reconstruction or replacement
    
      is  caused  by  the reconstruction or replacement of the sewer or by any
      other construction work performed by the city.
        d.  The  cost of constructing a curb-to-sewer connection in connection
      with the construction, reconstruction, or replacement of  a  sewer  duly
      authorized  on or after July first, nineteen hundred sixty-two, shall be
      paid initially out of the real property fund upon the  authorization  of
      the  board  of estimate. All sums received or collected in reimbursement
      of such cost pursuant to this section, including interest and  penalties
      thereon,  shall  be  paid  into the real property fund. This subdivision
      shall not apply to or  affect  the  manner  of  financing  the  cost  of
      repairing,  reconstructing  or replacing a curb-to-sewer connection when
      such repair, reconstruction or replacement is necessary because  of  the
      reconstruction  or  replacement  of  the  sewer  or because of any other
      construction work performed by the city.

Section 24-514 ::    
        
     
        ยง  24-514  Sewer  rents.  a.  Sewer  system,  defined. As used in this
      section the term "sewer system"  shall  mean  and  include  the  sewers,
      manholes,  intercepting  sewers,  sewage pumping, treatment and disposal
      works, and any other plants, works or equipment and  accessories  within
      the  city,  which  are used or useful in connection with the collection,
      treatment or disposal of sewage and waste, and which are owned, operated
      or maintained by the city as part of the public sewer system.
        b. Imposition and computation of sewer rent or charge. 1. In  addition
      to any other fees or charges provided by law, the owner of any parcel of
      real property connected with the sewer system, including but not limited
      to  real  property connected with the sewer system by means of a private
      sewer or drain emptying into the sewer system, shall pay a sewer rent or
      charge for the use of the sewer system. Such rent  or  charge  shall  be
      based on the water supplied to any such real property as measured by the
      amount  charged  for  such  water,  except as otherwise provided by this
      section. Such rent or charge shall be computed by  the  commissioner  of
      environmental  protection  in  accordance  with  the  provisions of this
      section.
        2. For any such property supplied with water from the municipal  water
      supply system the sewer rent or charge shall be equal in amount to sixty
      percent  of  the  charges  for water supplied to such property from such
      system.
        3. For any such property  supplied  with  water  by  a  private  water
      company, the commissioner of environmental protection shall, by rule and
      regulation,  subject  to  the approval of the board of estimate, fix the
      fraction of the charges for such water, which shall constitute the sewer
      rent for such property, so that  the  sewer  rent  or  charge  for  such
      property  shall,  as nearly as possible, be equivalent to the sewer rent
      or charge imposed under paragraph two of this subdivision  for  property
      supplied with water from the municipal water supply system.
        4.  If  any  such  property is supplied with river water or water from
      private wells, the sewer rent or charge for such property shall be equal
      in amount to sixty percent of the amount that would be charged  for  the
      quantity of water supplied from such sources if such water were supplied
      by the city at the rates charged for water supplied to metered premises.
      The commissioner of environmental protection shall estimate the quantity
      of  water supplied from such sources and shall compute the sewer rent or
      charge, on the basis of such estimated quantity, in accordance with  the
      provisions of this paragraph. However, if a water meter, approved by the
      commissioner of environmental protection, has been or shall be installed
      by  the  owner  or  occupant  of the premises to measure the quantity of
      water supplied from such sources, the quantity of water measured by such
      meter shall constitute the basis for computing the sewer rent or  charge
      in  accordance  with the provisions of this paragraph. In the event that
      such property supplied with river water or water from private  wells  is
      also  supplied with water from the municipal water supply system or by a
      private water company, the sewer rent or charge for such property  shall
      consist  of  the  rent or charge computed pursuant to this paragraph and
      the rent or charges computed in accordance with paragraph two  or  three
      of this subdivision as the case may be.
        5.  The  commissioner of environmental protection shall have the power
      to promulgate rules and regulations, subject  to  the  approval  of  the
      board of estimate, prescribing reasonable sewer rents or charges for any
      such  property  which is used for an industrial or commercial purpose of
      such a nature that water supplied to it cannot  be  entirely  discharged
      into  the sewer system. The sewer rent or charges prescribed pursuant to
      this paragraph shall be based, as far as practicable, upon the amount of
      sewage discharged into the sewer system as estimated by the commissioner
    
      of environmental protection, or where an  estimate  of  such  amount  is
      impracticable, upon any other basis bearing a reasonable relationship to
      the amount of sewage discharged into the sewer system.
        c.  Additional  rule  making powers. The commissioner of environmental
      protection shall have the  power  to  make  such  additional  rules  and
      regulations  as  may  be  necessary  to carry out the provisions of this
      section. Such rules and regulations shall be subject to approval by  the
      board of estimate.
        d.  Cooperation  by  private  persons,  water  companies,  and  public
      agencies.   The commissioner of  environmental  protection  may  require
      every  person  who owns or occupies real property within the city, every
      private water company supplying water to property within the  city,  and
      all  municipal  agencies,  officers, and employees to furnish him or her
      with such information as may be necessary to carry out the provisions of
      this section. Every such person, water  company,  or  municipal  agency,
      officer,   or   employee   shall  cooperate  with  the  commissioner  of
      environmental protection in carrying out the provisions of this  section
      and  shall comply with all rules and regulations promulgated pursuant to
      this section. Such commissioner  shall  have  the  power  to  hold  such
      hearings  and  to  subpoena  such witnesses and direct the production of
      such books and papers as may be necessary to carry out the provisions of
      this section.
        e. Exemptions from sewer rents or charges. Any real property which  is
      entitled  to  an  exemption  from  the payment of water rents or charges
      shall also be exempt from payment of the sewer rents or charges  imposed
      hereunder.
        f.  Payment and enforcement of sewer rents or charges. All sewer rents
      or charges imposed hereunder shall be due and payable at the  times  and
      in the manner provided in chapters three and four of title eleven of the
      code.  Such  rents  or  charges  shall  constitute  a lien upon the real
      property served by the sewer system and such lien  shall  be  prior  and
      superior  to  every  other  lien or claim except the lien of an existing
      tax, water rent or local assessment. Such  rents  or  charges  shall  be
      collected and the liens thereof may be foreclosed in the manner provided
      in chapters three and four of title eleven of this code.
        g.  Sewer  fund.  The  revenues derived from the sewer rentals imposed
      hereunder, including penalties and interest thereon, shall be kept in  a
      separate  and  distinct  fund  to  be known as the sewer fund. Such fund
      shall  be  used  for  the  payment  of  the  cost  of  the   management,
      maintenance,  operation  and  repair  of  the  sewer system, the cost of
      administering and enforcing the provisions of this section and the  cost
      of  collection  of  the  sewer  rents or charges imposed pursuant to the
      provisions of this section, and any surplus in such fund shall  be  used
      for  the  payment of the interest and amortization on any debt which has
      been or shall be incurred for the construction  of  intercepting  sewers
      and  sewage  treatment  and  disposal  works,  and  for the enlargement,
      replacement, or addition of  intercepting  sewers  or  sewage  treatment
      works. However, such funds shall not be used for the extension of sewers
      to serve unsewered areas.

      this section, shall have the following meanings: 1. A "dwelling" is  any
      building  or  structure or portion thereof which is occupied in whole or
      in part as the home, residence or sleeping place of one  or  more  human
      beings.
        2.  A  "private  dwelling"  is  any building or structure designed and
      occupied for residential purposes by not more than two families. Private
      dwellings shall also be deemed to include  a  series  of  one-family  or
      two-family  dwelling  units  each  of  which faces or is accessible to a
      legal street or public thoroughfare,  if  each  such  dwelling  unit  is
      equipped as a separate dwelling unit with all essential services, and if
      each  such  unit  is  arranged  so  that  it  may be approved as a legal
      one-family or two-family dwelling.
        3. A "multiple dwelling" is a dwelling which is either rented, leased,
      let or hired out, to be occupied, or is occupied, as  the  residence  or
      home  of  three  or  more families living independently of each other. A
      multiple dwelling shall also include residential quarters for members of
      personnel of any hospital staff which are not located  in  any  building
      used  primarily  for  hospital  use, but any building which was erected,
      altered or converted prior to July first, nineteen  hundred  fifty-five,
      to  be  occupied  by such members or personnel or is so occupied on such
      date shall not be subject to the requirements of the housing maintenance
      code only so long as it continues to be so occupied if there  are  local
      laws applicable to such building and such building is in compliance with
      such  local  laws.  A multiple dwelling does not include (i) a hospital,
      convent, monastery, asylum or public institution; or  (ii)  a  fireproof
      building  used  wholly  for commercial purposes except for not more than
      one janitor's apartment and not more than one penthouse occupied by  not
      more than two families.
        4.   The  term  "putrescible  solid  waste"  shall  mean  solid  waste
      containing organic matter having the  tendency  to  decompose  with  the
      formation of malodorous by-products.
        b.  Food  waste disposals for the discharge of putrescible food wastes
      from dwelling units may be installed in private dwellings  and  multiple
      dwellings, provided that:
        1.  all putrescible food wastes discharged to a sanitary sewer or to a
      combined storm and sanitary sewer are discharged in fluid form and at  a
      reasonably  uniform  rate  so  as to prevent clogging or stoppage of the
      drain line, sanitary sewer or combined storm and sanitary sewer;
        2. the installation of such food waste disposals is  approved  by  the
      department  of buildings and is in compliance with applicable provisions
      of the administrative code.
        c. 1. The department shall conduct a pilot study of the  use  of  food
      waste  disposals  in  private dwellings and multiple dwellings served by
      combined storm and sanitary sewer systems. The study shall include,  but
      need not be limited to, an analysis of the following:
        i. the impact of grease and food solids on combined sewers;
        ii. the impact on water consumption;
        iii. the impact on the nutrient content of raw and treated effluent;
        iv.  the  impact  of increased pollutant loadings to receiving waters,
      including increases in biological oxygen demand and suspended solids;
        v. the impacts on wastewater treatment processes;
        vi. the impact on sludge treatment processes and management;
        vii. the impact on  the  city's  ability  to  comply  with  applicable
      statutes, rules, regulations, permits and orders;
        viii.  the  impact  on  solid  waste  management  as determined by the
      department of sanitation; and
    
        ix. any other impacts on the environment, public  health  and  safety,
      and the cost of operating the water and sewer system.
        2.  The  department  may  select  an  appropriate  number  of  private
      dwellings or multiple dwellings within the city served by combined storm
      and sanitary sewer systems to participate in the pilot study. The number
      of food waste disposals that will be installed  as  part  of  the  pilot
      study  shall  be  no  fewer  than  one  hundred and shall not exceed one
      thousand.  The study shall be deemed to have commenced when  food  waste
      disposals  are installed in at least fifty percent of the dwelling units
      in the dwellings  selected  for  the  study  and  the  commissioner  has
      authorized the operation of these disposals; provided, however, that the
      department may deem the study to have commenced upon the installation of
      food  waste  disposals  in less than fifty percent of the dwelling units
      within the dwellings selected for the study if the department finds that
      a  valid  study  may  be  conducted  with  such  lesser  percentage   of
      installations.  In  combined  storm and sanitary sewer areas, food waste
      disposals may be installed only  in  those  dwellings  selected  by  the
      department to participate in the study.
        3.  The  department shall within fifteen months of the commencement of
      the pilot study, but not later than twenty-one months from the effective
      date of this local law submit a report to  the  mayor  and  the  council
      which  shall  include  a detailed analysis of the findings of such study
      and conclusions and recommendations based on such analysis with  respect
      to  the  installation  of  food waste disposals in private dwellings and
      multiple dwellings served by combined storm and sanitary sewer systems.

      real property connected with the sewer system, including but not limited
      to real property connected with the sewer system by means of  a  private
      sewer or drain emptying into the sewer system, shall pay a surcharge for
      the use of the sewer system for discharging any sewage, industrial waste
      or   other   waste,   accepted   for  admission  thereto  in  which  the
      characteristics resulting from pollutants contained therein  exceed  the
      maximum values of such characteristics in receivable industrial waste as
      defined  in  subdivision a of this section and the rules and regulations
      of the commissioner adopted pursuant to this section.
        2.  i. Such charge shall be computed by the commissioner in accordance
      with the following formula: The amount of the surcharge shall equal  the
      product of:
    
        (A)  the  cost per pound of removing pollutants from the sewage in the
      sewer system,
        (B) a conversion factor and
        (C)  the volume of sewage, industrial waste or other wastes discharged
      into the sewer  system,  multiplied  by  the  sum  of  (A)  the  average
      concentration  in  parts  per  million by weight of suspended solids for
      sewage, industrial waste or  other  wastes  discharged  into  the  sewer
      system,  in excess of three hundred fifty parts per million, and (B) the
      average concentration in parts per million by weight of the  biochemical
      oxygen  demand  for sewage, industrial waste, or other wastes discharged
      into the sewer system in excess of three hundred parts per million. Such
      formula expressed in symbols shall be as follows:
     
               Ds = C x F x V x [(S.S. -- 350) + (B.O.D. - 300)]
      where
               Ds = amount of surcharge, in dollars;
                C = cost per pound (in dollars) of removing pollutants
                    from the sewage discharged into the sewer system
                    expressed to the nearest tenth of a cent;
                F = 62.4
                    1,000,000, i.e., the factor for converting parts per
                    million by weight to pounds per million cubic feet;
                V = volume, in cubic feet of sewage, industrial
                    waste or other wastes discharged from such
                    premises into the sewer system;
             S.S. = parts per million by weight of suspended solids
                    in sewage, industrial waste or other wastes discharged
                    from such premises into the sewer system;
              350 = maximum parts per million by weight of S.S.
                    allowable in receivable industrial waste;
           B.O.D. = parts per million by weight of B.O.D. in the
                    sewage, industrial waste or other wastes discharged
                    from such premises into the sewer system;
              300 = maximum parts per million by weight of B.O.D. allowable
                    in receivable industrial waste.
     
        ii. In applying such formula the commissioner may use, as  the  figure
      representing  the  number  of  cubic  feet of sewage discharged into the
      sewer system,

      private  water company as shown upon the water meter if the premises are
      metered, or
        (B) if the premises are  supplied  with  river  water  or  water  from
      private  wells,  the  amount  of  water  supplied  from  such sources as
      estimated by the commissioner, pursuant to paragraph four of subdivision
      b of section 24-514 of this chapter, or
        (C) if such premises are used for an industrial or commercial  purpose
      of  such  a  nature  that  the  water supplied to the premises cannot be
      entirely discharged into the sewer system, the estimate of the amount of
      sewage discharged into  the  sewer  system  made  by  the  commissioner,
      pursuant to the provisions of paragraph five of subdivision b of section
      24-514 of the code, or
        (D)  the  number  of  cubic  feet  of sewage discharged into the sewer
      system as determined by measurements and  samples  taken  at  a  manhole
      installed by the owner of the property served by the sewer system at his
      or  her  own  expense in accordance with the terms and conditions of the
      permit issued by the commissioner pursuant to this method, or

      other  waste  which  has  characteristics  which  do  not conform to the
      characteristics prescribed for normal sewage  or  receivable  industrial
      waste  pursuant  to  paragraphs  ten and eleven of subdivision a of this
      section, or  which  contains  toxic  substances  or  other  material  or
      substance excluded from the sewer system by the commissioner pursuant to
      this  section is discharged into the sewer system from any premises, the
      commissioner shall have the power to take such samples and tests as  may
      be  necessary  to determine the nature and concentration of such wastes,
      and shall have the power to reassess his or her findings by taking  such
      additional  samples or tests at any time or by periodic rechecks without
      notice to the owner or person discharging such wastes. Samples shall  be
      taken and flow measurements made, whenever possible, at a common manhole
      into  which  all  flows  of sewage, industrial waste or other waste from
      such premises are combined. Such manhole shall  be  constructed  by  the
      owner  of  such  premises,  at  his or her own expense, when directed by
      order of the commissioner. Whenever the installation of such  a  manhole
      is  impossible  or  impracticable,  the  owner  of  such  premises shall
      construct and maintain  at  his  or  her  own  expense,  any  additional
      manholes required by order of the commissioner, for accurate measurement
      of  all flow of sewage, industrial waste or other wastes discharged from
      such premises into the sewer system. Failure to comply with an order  of
      the  commissioner  issued  pursuant  to this subdivision may subject the
      premises to temporary termination of water supply in accordance with the
      provisions of section 11-314 of the code.
        e. Rules and regulations. 1. The commissioner shall have the power  to
      promulgate rules and regulations:
        (a)  identifying  toxic  substances  and  regulating,  restricting  or
      prohibiting the discharge of such substances into the  sewer  system  in
      amounts  or  concentrations  which  may cause any of the adverse effects
      described in paragraph thirteen of subdivision a of this section;
        (b) regulating, restricting or  prohibiting  the  discharge  into  the
      sewer system of any material or substance which is or may be detrimental
      or destructive to the sewer system or the treatment processes thereof or
      to the public health or welfare;
        (c) specifying the characteristics and the minimum and maximum amounts
      thereof,   in  addition  to  those  specified  in  paragraph  eleven  of
      subdivision a hereof, for receivable industrial waste;
        (d) such additional rules and  regulations  as  may  be  necessary  to
      protect  personnel,  the  sewer system and the treatment process thereof
      and the receiving waters; and
        (e) regulating the amount and concentration of substances contained in
      industrial waste discharged directly or indirectly into the sewer system
      to achieve  compliance  with  effluent  limitations  imposed  upon  city
      discharges  to receiving waters by federal or state law or regulation or
      a discharge permit issued pursuant thereto.
        2. The commissioner shall by rule or regulation adopt  the  standards,
      prohibitions  and  requirements  promulgated  under  the  federal  water
    
      pollution control act, commonly referred to as the clean water  act,  as
      amended,  except where such standards, prohibitions and requirements are
      less stringent than those which  are  established  by  the  commissioner
      pursuant to paragraph one or three of this subdivision.
        3.  Notwithstanding  any  inconsistent provision of paragraphs one and
      two  of  this  subdivision,  the  commissioner  may  order  any   person
      discharging  a  toxic  substance  directly  or indirectly into the sewer
      system or into any private sewer or drain emptying into the sewer system
      to reduce the amount or concentration of such toxic substance to a level
      which the commissioner determines to be economically achievable  by  the
      discharger  notwithstanding  that such level is lower than that which is
      prescribed in the regulations adopted pursuant to paragraph one  or  two
      or  that  the  discharge  is  not regulated under such provision. Within
      twenty days after the issuance of an  order  by  the  commissioner,  any
      person  affected  by  such  order  may  request  a  hearing  before  the
      commissioner. The commissioner may suspend, revoke or modify the order.
        f.  Cooperation  by  private  persons,  water  companies  and   public
      agencies.    The  commissioner  may  require  every  person  who owns or
      occupies real property within the city and every private  water  company
      supplying  water to property within the city, to furnish him or her with
      such information as may be necessary to carry out the provisions of this
      section. The commissioner shall have the power to hold hearings  and  to
      subpoena  any such persons or company, or any officer, employee or agent
      of any such company, and direct the production of books  and  papers  in
      order  to  carry  out the provisions of this section. Every such person,
      water company  or  public  official  or  municipal  agency,  officer  or
      employee  shall  cooperate  with  the  commissioner  in carrying out the
      provisions  of  this  section  and  shall  comply  with  all  rules  and
      regulations promulgated pursuant to this section.
        g. Payment and enforcement of sewer surcharges. All surcharges imposed
      hereunder  shall  be  due  and  payable  at  the times and in the manner
      provided in chapters three and four of title eleven  of  the  code  with
      respect  to  the payment of sewer rents based upon the metered supply of
      water. Such sewer surcharges shall  constitute  a  lien  upon  the  real
      property  served  by  the sewage system and such lien shall be prior and
      superior to every other lien or claim except the  lien  of  an  existing
      tax,  water  rent, sewer rent or local assessment. Such sewer surcharges
      shall be collected and the liens thereof may be foreclosed in the manner
      provided in chapters three and four of title eleven  of  the  code.  The
      revenues  derived from the sewer surcharges imposed hereunder, including
      penalties and interest  thereon  shall  be  paid  into  the  sewer  fund
      established  pursuant to section 24-514 of the code and shall be used in
      the manner and for the purposes provided therein.
    
    
    
    
    
    
    

Section 24-524
--------------

Section 24-524 ::    
        
     
        ยง  24-524  Enforcement  and  penalties.  a.  Notwithstanding any other
      provision of law, the commissioner of environmental protection  and  the
      environmental  control  board  shall  enforce the provisions of sections
      24-504 through 24-522 and 24-523 of this  chapter  and  the  regulations
      promulgated pursuant thereto. Such commissioner and board shall have the
      power  to  issue  such  orders  as  may be provided for therein and such
      additional orders as may  be  necessary  for  the  enforcement  of  such
      provisions.
        b.  1.  Whenever  the  commissioner  of  environmental  protection has
      reasonable cause to  believe  that  a  discharge  in  violation  of  the
      provisions  of sections 24-504 through 24-522 and 24-523 of this chapter
      or any order, rule or regulation issued by the board or commissioner  or
      in  violation  of  the  conditions of any permit issued pursuant to such
      provisions creates or may create an imminent danger to the sewer  system
      or  to  the public health or to the life or safety of persons, he or she
      may issue a cease and  desist  order  requiring  any  person  who  owns,
      leases,  operates,  controls  or  supervises  any  building,  structure,
      facility or installation from which the unlawful discharge is emitted to
      take such action as may be necessary to halt or prevent such discharge.
        2. If service of the order cannot  be  made  personally  because  such
      person  cannot  be  located  at  such  time  then service may be made by
      delivering a copy to a person of suitable  age  and  discretion  at  the
      residence  or  place  of  business of the person sought to be served. If
      service cannot be made personally or by such delivery  to  a  person  of
      suitable  age and discretion because of inability to locate or to obtain
      the name or address of such person at such time, service may be made  by
      conspicuously posting a copy of such order upon the property to which it
      relates.  The  posting  of such order shall be sufficient notice of such
      order to all persons  having  a  duty  in  relation  thereto  under  the
      provisions of this subdivision.
        3.  If  the order is not complied with or so far complied with as such
      commissioner may regard as reasonable, within the time specified therein
      such commissioner may act to halt or prevent such discharge by:
        i.  sealing,  blocking  or  otherwise  inactivating   any   equipment,
      facility, or device;
        ii. terminating the water supply to the premises;
        iii.  sealing, blocking or otherwise inactivating any private sewer or
      drain emptying directly or indirectly into the sewer system;
        iv.  any  other  means  or  method  that  is  reasonable   under   the
      circumstances.  For  such  purpose  the  commissioner  of  environmental
      protection or his or her deputies or such other officers or employees as
      are designated by the commissioner may enter on any  public  or  private
      property.
        4.  Any  person affected by such an order may make written application
      to the environmental control board for a hearing. Such hearing shall  be
      provided,  pursuant to the rules and regulations of the board, and shall
      be held within forty-eight hours after the receipt of such  application.
      The board may suspend, modify or terminate such order.
        d.  1. In the case of any continued or knowing violation of any of the
      provisions of sections 24-504 through 24-522 and 24-523 of this  chapter
      or  any  order,  rule  or regulation issued by the environmental control
      board or commissioner of environmental protection pursuant thereto or of
      the conditions of any permit issued pursuant to such provisions or where
      the board finds that the violation of any of such provisions or  of  the
      conditions  of  any  such permit presents or may present a danger to the
      environment or threatens to interfere with the operation  of  the  sewer
      system,  the  board  after  notice  and the opportunity for a hearing in
      accordance with the rules and regulations of  the  board,  may  issue  a
    
      cease  and desist order requiring any person who owns, leases, operates,
      controls or supervises any building, structure, facility or installation
      to cease and desist from any activity or  process  which  causes  or  is
      conducted  so  as  to  cause such violation within the time specified in
      such order.
        2. Such order may provide that if the order is not complied with or so
      far complied with as the commissioner of  environmental  protection  may
      regard   as   reasonable   within   the  time  specified  therein,  such
      commissioner may  take  such  action  as  shall  be  specified  therein,
      including but not limited to:
        i.  sealing,  blocking  or  inactivating  any  equipment,  facility or
      device;
        ii. terminating the water supply to the premises;
        iii. sealing, blocking or inactivating  any  private  sewer  or  drain
      emptying directly or indirectly into the sewer system.
        For  such  purpose the commissioner of environmental protection or his
      or her deputies or such other officers or employees as are designated by
      such commissioner may enter on any public or private property.
        e. If the respondent fails to comply with  any  order  issued  by  the
      environmental  control board or commissioner of environmental protection
      or with the conditions of any permit,  or  such  board  or  commissioner
      otherwise  deems  it  necessary,  the corporation counsel, acting in the
      name of the city, may maintain an action or proceeding  in  a  court  of
      competent   jurisdiction  to  compel  compliance  with  or  restrain  by
      injuction the violation of any order or permit issued by such  board  or
      commissioner.
        f.  Any  person  who  violates  or  fails  to  comply  with any of the
      provisions of section 24-504 through 24-522 and 24-523 of  this  chapter
      or  any  order,  rule  or regulation issued by the environmental control
      board or commission of environmental protection pursuant thereto or with
      the conditions of any permit issued pursuant thereto shall be liable for
      a civil penalty not exceeding ten thousand dollars for  each  violation,
      provided  that  this  subdivision  shall  not  apply to subdivision c of
      section 24-509 or subdivisions a and b of section 24-521,  and  provided
      that  the  penalty  for  the  removal of a manhole cover in violation of
      section 24-517 shall be not less than two thousand five hundred dollars.
      In the case of a continuing violation each day's continuance shall be  a
      separate  and  distinct  offense.  The environmental control board shall
      have the power to impose such civil penalties. A  proceeding  to  impose
      such  penalties  shall  be  commenced  by  the  service  of  a notice of
      violation returnable to such board.  Such  board,  after  a  hearing  as
      provided by the rules and regulations of the board, shall have the power
      to  enforce its final decisions and orders imposing such civil penalties
      as if they were money judgments pursuant to subdivision d of section one
      thousand forty-nine-a of the New York  city  charter.  A  civil  penalty
      imposed  by  the board may also be collected in an action brought in the
      name of the city in any court of competent jurisdiction. The  board,  in
      its  discretion,  may,  within the limits set forth in this subdivision,
      establish a schedule of  civil  penalties  indicating  the  minimum  and
      maximum penalty for each separate offense.
        g.  In  addition  to the civil penalties set forth in subdivision f of
      this section, any person who knowingly violates or fails to comply  with
      any  provision  of  sections  24-504 through 24-522 or section 24-523 of
      this chapter or any order, rule or regulation issued by the commissioner
      of environmental protection  or  environmental  control  board  pursuant
      thereto  or  with  the  conditions of any permit issued pursuant thereto
      shall be guilty of a misdemeanor and, upon conviction thereof, shall  be
      punished  by a fine of not less than two hundred fifty nor more than ten
    
      thousand dollars, or by imprisonment not exceeding thirty days, or  both
      for  each  offense,  provided  that  this subdivision shall not apply to
      subdivision c of section 24-509 or  subdivisions  a  and  b  of  section
      24-521,  and  provided  that the punishment for the removal of a manhole
      cover in violation of section 24-517 shall be a fine of  not  less  than
      five hundred dollars nor more than ten thousand dollars, or imprisonment
      not  exceeding  thirty  days, or both for each offense. In the case of a
      continuing violation each day's continuance  shall  be  a  separate  and
      distinct  offense.  In  addition to its application to any other person,
      the fine provided for in this paragraph shall be deemed a  special  fine
      for  a  corporation within the meaning of section 80.10 of the penal law
      of the state of New York.
        h. Any person who  violates  or  fails  to  comply  with  any  of  the
      provisions  of sections 24-504 through 24-522 and 24-523 of this chapter
      or any order, rule or regulation issued pursuant  thereto  or  with  the
      conditions  of any permit issued pursuant thereto shall be liable to the
      city for any expense, loss or damage suffered by the city by  reason  of
      such violation.
        i. Unless otherwise provided in this section, service of any notice or
      order  required by this section may be made either personally or by mail
      addressed to the last known address of the person to be served.

      subdivision (g) of this section, to  discharge  storm  water  from  such
      development or lot:
        (1)  An  owner of a lot within such a development or of such a lot not

      vehicular  or  pedestrian  access thereto, from such boundary by sewers,
      constructed in accordance with the requirements in  subdivision  (e)  of
      this  section  and  elsewhere  in  this code and of the department, to a
      point of disposal described in paragraph three of this subdivision.
        (3) Points of disposal for storm water disposed of  pursuant  to  this
      subdivision are:
        (A) the New York Harbor, or a point on a tidal creek acceptable to the
      commissioner  as  an  adequate  storm  water  outlet; provided that only
      building storm  sewers  and,  if  necessary,  street  storm  sewers  are
      constructed  and  that  no  sewage  is  discharged  at  such  a point of
      disposal;  and  provided  that  such  outlets  shall  only  be  used  in
      compliance with applicable provisions of law;
    
        (B)  a  public  street  storm  sewer  or public street combined sewer,
      regardless of its distance from the property, to which the  commissioner
      determines  that  conveyance of storm water is feasible, as described in
      subdivision (g) of this  section,  provided  that  no  sewage  shall  be
      discharged into a street storm sewer; or
        (C)  an existing private street storm sewer or private street combined
      sewer to which the commissioner  determines  that  conveyance  of  storm

      the  construction  of  all  new buildings for which new building permits
      have been filed on or after January first, nineteen hundred ninety-four.
      If the commissioner determines that no  public  street  storm  sewer  or
      public  street  combined  sewer  is  located  within  five hundred feet,
      measured along a street, alley or right-of-way, from any  point  on  the
      boundary  of  a  development  or of a lot not contained in a development
      into which it would be feasible  to  discharge  storm  water  from  such
      development  or such lot, an owner of a lot within such a development or
      of such a lot not within a development who is constructing or causing to
      be constructed a building on such  lot  shall  dispose  of  storm  water
      falling  or  coming  to  rest within such lot, together with storm water
      falling or coming to rest on all streets and other paved  areas  outside
      of  such  lot  which  are  constructed or altered in connection with the
      construction of such building  for  the  primary  purpose  of  improving
      vehicular  or  pedestrian  access  thereto,  by  means acceptable to the
      commissioner and  the  commissioner  of  buildings,  including  but  not
      limited  to  those  set  forth  in  section  P110.13  of  this reference
      standard; provided, however, that such persons shall not be required  to
      construct  street  storm  sewers or street combined sewers for distances
      greater than seven hundred fifty feet.
        (e) Maximum required  capacity  for  street  storm  sewers  or  street
      combined  sewers  required by this section. The commissioner may require
      an owner of a lot or a development who is required by  this  section  to
      construct  street  storm  sewers  or street combined sewers to construct
      such sewers with a capacity not to exceed twenty-five percent above  and
      beyond  the capacity which the commissioner determines is needed for the
      disposal of storm water falling or  coming  to  rest  on  such  property
      together  with  storm water falling or coming to rest on all streets and
      other paved areas outside of such  property  which  are  constructed  or
      altered  in  connection with the construction of a building or buildings
      on such property for the  primary  purpose  of  improving  vehicular  or
      pedestrian   access  thereto.  The  department  reserves  the  right  to
      construct catch basins connected to such sewers at the cost and  expense
      of  the city, to alleviate flooding or ponding conditions, provided that
      the commissioner determines that the capacity of such sewers  shall  not
      be exceeded.
        (f)  Repair  of defects in catch basins and sewers required. Any owner
      of property who causes any catch basin or  any  sewer  which  shall  lie
      outside  of such property to be constructed pursuant to subdivision (b),
      (c) or (d) of this section shall cause all defects in such  catch  basin
    
      or  sewer and all faults in its installation to be repaired for a period
      of two  years  after  it  has  been  installed,  immediately  after  the
      department orders such person to do so.
        (g)  Feasibility  of discharging storm water into a street storm sewer
      or a street combined sewer. The commissioner shall  determine  that  the
      discharge  of storm water into a street storm sewer or a street combined
      sewer pursuant to this section is feasible if he or she finds that:
        (1) the sewer is of adequate capacity to receive all such storm  water
      or  would  be  adequate to receive it if the owner of property installed
      controlled flow storm water systems, in accordance with the requirements
      of section P110.6 of reference standard RS-16 of this code, to  restrict
      the  maximum  anticipated  storm  water  flow  to  a  level  set  by the
      commissioner;
        (2) the sewer is in adequate physical condition to receive such  storm
      water;
        (3)  no  physical  obstacle  which would make conveyance of such storm
      water to the sewer  impracticable  exists  between  the  sewer  and  the
      boundaries  of  the development or lot from which such storm water shall
      be discharged;
        (4) conveyance of such storm water to the sewer is  not  impracticable
      because  of the elevation of the sewer in relation to the development or
      lot from which such storm water shall be discharged;
        (5) the sewer is located in the same drainage area as all or  most  of
      the  development or lot from which such storm water shall be discharged;
      and
        (6) no other factor reasonably related to the conveyance of such storm
      water from such development or lot to the sewer would make the discharge
      of such storm water into the sewer impracticable  or  undesirable  as  a
      proper means of storm water disposal.
        (h) Time by which construction of the part of the storm water drainage
      system  required  by  this  section  shall be completed. The part of the
      storm water drainage system for property required by this section  shall
      be  completed prior to the issuance of a certificate of occupancy by the
      department of buildings for, and actual occupancy of,  the  building  in
      connection  with  which  such  storm  water  drainage  system  is  being
      constructed.
        (i) Performance bond, license and insurance required. If an  owner  of
      property  is  required to construct or repair defects in catch basins or
      sewers which shall lie outside of such property, in connection with  the
      construction of a new building pursuant to this section, he or she shall
      provide the department with:
        (1)   a  performance  bond  or  other  security  satisfactory  to  the
      department and approved as to form by the law department of the city for
      the full cost, as estimated by the department, of  performing  all  such
      construction and repair work;
        (2)  any license or other written instrument which the commissioner or
      the law department of the city may reasonably request  which  gives  the
      department,  its agents and contractors and the surety for a performance
      bond described in paragraph one of this subdivision the legal  right  to
      enter  private  property  to  perform such construction and repair work,
      pursuant to the terms of the performance bond or in accordance with  the
      conditions of acceptance of other security described in paragraph one of
      this  subdivision,  and  the  legal right to connect to, to extend or to
      discharge storm water into any private sewer authorized as  a  point  of
      disposal pursuant to paragraph three of subdivision (c) of this section,
      in  the  event  that the owner of property fails to do so as required by
      this section; and
    
        (3) insurance of a kind and in an amount which  the  commissioner  and
      the  law  department  of  the  city deem satisfactory to insure the city
      fully for all risks of loss, damage to property or injury to or death of
      persons to whomever occurring arising out of or in connection  with  the
      performance of such sewer construction and repair work.
        (j)  Contractual obligations of the city not abrogated. The provisions
      of this section shall not be construed to  abrogate  or  contravene  any
      contractual  obligation  of  the  city to construct storm water drainage
      systems or parts thereof. The requirements  of  subdivisions  (b),  (c),
      (d),  (f)  and  (i) of this section shall be inapplicable to an owner of
      property insofar as they relate to any construction work required to  be
      performed by the city pursuant to such a contractual obligation.
        (k)   Determination  by  the  board  of  standards  and  appeals.  Any
      determination made by the board of standards and appeals with  reference
      to  the  disposal  of storm water, pursuant to the provisions of section
      27-160 and section P110.2 of reference  standard  RS-16  of  this  code,
      shall be binding upon the department for the purposes of the enforcement
      and administration of this section.
