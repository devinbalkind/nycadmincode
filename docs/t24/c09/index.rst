      shall  seek  to enter into agreements with federal and/or state agencies

      anticipate  taking  further  actions  requiring  additional  cleanup and
      investigation for  contamination  that  an  enrollee  has  appropriately
      addressed  under  the  local brownfield cleanup program, subject to such
      terms and conditions as may be required  by  the  federal  and/or  state
      agency  or  other  entity.  Nothing  in this section shall in any way be
      interpreted as a binding legal commitment or obligation on behalf of the

      cleanup program, nor in any way restrict the  director's  discretion  in
      negotiating  the  terms  and  conditions  of  such an agreement with the
      federal and/or state agency or other entity.
        (b)(1) The city nonetheless shall reserve all of its rights concerning
      any further investigation and/or remediation the office deems  necessary
      due to:
        (i)  environmental  contamination at, on, under, or emanating from the
      local brownfield site if, in light of such conditions, the  site  is  no
      longer protective of public health or the environment; or
        (ii)  non-compliance  with  the  terms of the local brownfield cleanup
      agreement, the remedial action work  plan,  the  site  management  plan,
      declaration  of  covenants  and  restrictions,  or  the  certificate  of
      completion; or
        (iii) fraud committed by the applicant in the application  for  or  by
      the  enrollee  during  participation  in  the  local  brownfield cleanup
      program; or
        (iv) a written finding by the office that a change in an environmental
      standard, factor, or criterion upon which the remedial action work  plan
      was   based,   renders   the  local  brownfield  site  remedial  program
      implemented at the site no longer protective of  public  health  or  the
      environment; or
        (v)  a  change  in  the  local brownfield site's use subsequent to the
      office's issuance of the certificate  of  completion  unless  additional
      remediation  is undertaken as determined by the office, which shall meet
      the standard for protection of public health and  the  environment  that
      applies under this chapter.
        (2)  In  the  case  of a volunteer, subparagraph v of paragraph one of
      this subdivision shall not apply if the property has been remediated for
      unrestricted use as provided in section  27-1415  of  the  environmental
      conservation law.
        (c)  The  certificate  of completion provided pursuant to this section
      shall run with the land,  extending  to  the  enrollee's  successors  or
      assigns through acquisition of title to the local brownfield site and to
    
      a  person  who develops or otherwise occupies the local brownfield site;
      provided, however, that such persons act with due care and in good faith
      to adhere to the requirements of the local brownfield cleanup agreement,
      remedial   action  work  plan,  site  management  plan,  declaration  of
      covenants  and  restrictions,  and  certificate   of   completion.   The
      certificate of completion does not extend, and cannot be transferred, to
      a  person  who  is  responsible  for  the  disposal  or the discharge of
      contaminants on  the  local  brownfield  site  according  to  applicable
      principles of statutory or common law liability as of the effective date
      of  the  certification  of  completion  issued pursuant to this chapter,
      unless that person was party to the local brownfield  cleanup  agreement
      for the local brownfield site.
        (d)  The  provisions  of  this section shall not affect an action or a
      claim, including a statutory or common law  claim  for  contribution  or
      indemnification, that an enrollee has or may have against a third party.
        (e) Nothing in this section shall be construed to affect the liability
      of  any  person  with respect to any costs, damages, or investigative or
      remedial activities that  are  not  included  in  the  local  brownfield
      cleanup agreement, or remedial action work plan for the local brownfield
      site.
