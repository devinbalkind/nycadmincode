        ยง  24-360  Water  supply  to  municipalities other than New York city;
      connections; charges; regulations; quantity to be taken. a. It shall  be
      lawful  for  any of the municipal corporations or water districts in the
      counties of  Ulster,  Greene,  Delaware,  Schoharie,  Sullivan,  Orange,
      Westchester  and  Putnam, and for the village of Deposit in the counties
      of Delaware and Broome, to take and receive from any of the  reservoirs,
      aqueducts,  conduits, streams or pipes of the city a supply of water for
      the uses and purposes of such municipal corporations or water  districts
      or  village  and  to  that  end  such  municipal  corporations  or water
      districts are, and each of them is, and such village also is, authorized
      and empowered to lay  the  necessary  mains,  pipes,  valves,  hydrants,
      supply  pipes  and  other  necessary  appurtenances  for the use of such
      water, without the consent of any board, officer, bureau, or  department
      of the state or any subdivision thereof.
        b.  The connections with such reservoirs, aqueducts, conduits, streams
      or pipes shall be made at the expense of such  municipalities  or  water
      districts.  They  shall  pay  to the city such fair and reasonable water
      charges or rates as may be  agreed  upon  between  the  commissioner  of
      environmental   protection   and   the  authorities  of  such  municipal
      corporations or water districts  or  as  from  time  to  time  upon  the
      application  of  either  party  shall  be  fixed  by  the New York state
      department of environmental conservation,  which  department  is  hereby
      given  power  to  fix  such  fair  and reasonable charges or rates after
      hearing all parties interested. The expenses of  any  such  hearing  and
      decision  by the New York state department of environmental conservation
      shall be paid by  the  applicant.  Bills  for  such  expenses  shall  be
      certified  by such department to the applicant and paid by the applicant
      directly to the  claimant  within  thirty  days  of  the  date  of  such
      certification.
        c.  Such  charges  or  rates shall not, however, exceed the charges or
      rates now charged by the city to persons using water in that city.  Such
      fair and reasonable charges or rates shall be determined on the basis of
      the  actual total cost of the water to the city after deducting from the
      total cost all construction costs and expenses of operation, maintenance
      and carrying charges incurred within the corporate limits of the city in
      connection with the distribution and delivery of the water  within  such
      limits.  Such charges or rates fixed by the New York state department of
      environmental conservation shall be subject to  review  by  the  supreme
      court.
        d.  Any  such municipal corporation or water district desiring to take
      and receive water under  the  provisions  of  this  section  shall  make
      application  to the commissioner of environmental protection in writing,
      showing the place and manner in  which  it  is  proposed  to  make  such
      connections.  Such commissioner shall have exclusive jurisdiction in the
      premises, to the exclusion  of  any  other  board,  officer,  bureau  or
      department of the state or any subdivision thereof. It shall be the duty
      of  the  commissioner  to  grant  a  permit  or  authorization  for such
      connections, under  reasonable  rules  and  regulations,  including  the
      installation  of  proper  meters  or  other devices for ascertaining the
      quantity of water thus taken.
        e. The daily quantity of water which may be taken and received by  any
      municipal  corporation  or  water  district under the provisions of this
      section shall not exceed the  quantity  calculated  by  multiplying  the
      number  of  its inhabitants as shown by the last preceding census of the
      United States or the last state or  official  municipal  census  by  the
      daily per capita consumption in the city of New York.

      of   every   name  and  nature  which  may  result  from  the  building,
      construction, reconstruction, alteration or changing of such sewers, and
      shall also at the expense, cost and charge of the city of New York,  but
      in  the  name  of  the  city  of Kingston, acquire by purchase or by the
      condemnation proceedings provided for by this subchapter, all rights  in
      and  over  private  lands  in  the  city  of  Kingston,  which it may be
      necessary to acquire in order to build, construct, reconstruct, alter or
      change such sewers. The city of New York in executing such plan, may use
      for such purposes the public streets of the  city  of  Kingston  or  any
      right  of  way  or  easement  that  the city of Kingston now has for the
      purpose of constructing or maintaining sewers.
