        §  24-354  Work  and materials to be procured by contract; exceptions;
      certificate of public interest. a. All work hereby authorized to be done
      and all  materials  hereby  authorized  to  be  furnished  involving  an
      expenditure  of over one thousand dollars, shall be procured by contract
      made in the manner required by and pursuant to the  provisions  of  this
      subchapter.  The  commissioner of environmental protection, however, may
      without contract cause such surveys to be made and such maps, plans  and
      estimates  to be prepared, as shall, in his or her opinion, be necessary
      to carry out the provisions of this subchapter, and may appoint and  fix
      the  compensation  of  suitable engineers and other persons to supervise
      and inspect all work hereby authorized to be done. The  commissioner  of
      environmental  protection  may  procure  any  work  to  be  done without
      contract, not involving an expenditure of over five thousand dollars, if
      the commissioner certifies that in his or her opinion,  it  is  for  the
      public  interest  that  such  work  be done; and in such certificate the
      commissioner shall state his or her reasons therefor.
        b. Notwithstanding any inconsistent provisions of this  subchapter  or
      of  any  general  or  special  law,  the  commissioner  of environmental
      protection, during the existence of a state of war  between  the  United
      States  of  America  and the governments of Germany, Japan and Italy, or
      any of them, and for six months immediately  following  the  termination
      thereof,  may  procure  or  contract  for,  without  public letting, any
      equipment or materials necessary for  the  completion  of  the  Delaware
      aqueduct  and  appurtenant  structures  and  for  any work to be done in
      connection with the installation of such equipment or materials  if  the
      commissioner  certifies  that in his or her opinion, it is in the public
      interest that any such equipment or material be procured  or  contracted
      for  or  any  such  work  be  done, without public letting, and any such
      certificate of the commissioner shall state his or her reasons therefor.
      Any such certificate shall be filed in the office of the comptroller  of
      the city of New York.
    
    
    
    
    
    
    

Section 24-355

Section 24-355 ::    
        
     
        §  24-355  Police  protection  to  inhabitants  of construction areas;
      appointment and dismissal of police; powers and duties. a. It  shall  be
      the  duty  of  the  commissioner  of environmental protection to provide
      proper police protection to the inhabitants of the localities  in  which
      any  work  may  be  constructed  under  the authority of this subchapter
      during the period of construction, against  the  acts  or  omissions  of
      persons  employed  on such works or found in their neighborhood. To that
      end the commissioner is authorized and required to appoint a  sufficient
      number of persons to adequately police such localities for such periods.
      The commissioner shall also have power to remove such persons and to fix
      or   change   their   compensation  in  his  or  her  discretion,  which
      compensation shall be paid  by  the  city  upon  a  certificate  of  the
      commissioner,  as  part of the expense authorized to be incurred by this
      subchapter.
        b. The commissioner of environmental protection  shall  give  to  each
      person  so  appointed  a certificate of appointment and certified copies
      thereof, one of which shall be filed in the office  of  the  sheriff  of
      each  county in which any work shall be in process of construction under
      this subchapter and in which such person shall be authorized to  perform
      that person's duties. Each person so appointed shall be and have all the
      powers  of  a  peace  officer  in  the  county  where  any work is being
      constructed under the authority of this subchapter. Such person shall at
      all times when on duty wear upon his or her clothing or have in  his  or
      her  possession a shield or other suitable badge of authority which such
      person shall at once exhibit to any person asking therefor.
        c. It shall be the special duty of the persons so appointed to prevent
      breaches of the peace and unlawful depredations and to arrest and  bring
      before the proper magistrates persons employed on such works or found in
      the  vicinity  thereof,  who  are  guilty  of  offenses  against the law
      punishable by death, imprisonment or fines, or  persons  whom  they  may
      have reasonable cause to believe to be guilty of such offenses.
        d. The sheriff of a county wherein a certificate of appointment of any
      such  person as a peace officer is filed may cancel such certificate for
      cause, and shall immediately give notice in writing of such cancellation
      to the commissioner of environmental protection, specifying the cause of
      such revocation. Such notice may be given by mail. On such  cancellation
      the authority of such person as a peace officer shall immediately cease.
        e.  Any  expense  necessarily  incurred by a county, town or city in a
      criminal action or proceeding against any person employed on  any  works
      constructed  or  in process of construction under this subchapter, or in
      the suppression of riots among persons employed on such work, or in  the
      prevention  of  the commission of crime by such person, after being duly
      audited, as required by law, shall constitute a claim in favor  of  such
      county,  town  or city against the city of New York and an action may be
      maintained on such audit as for money paid to the use of the city.
    
    
    
    
    
    
    

Section 24-356
--------------

Section 24-356 ::    
        
     
        §  24-356  Construction  and repair of highways and bridges; rules and
      regulations to prevent improper use. a. The city is hereby  required  to
      build  and  construct such highways and bridges as may be made necessary
      by the construction of any  reservoir  under  this  subchapter,  and  to
      repair  and forever maintain such additional highways and bridges and to
      remove the snow and to sand the  highway  surfaces  whenever  necessary,
      except  such as shall be part of any state route; and in case any bridge
      or highway thus constructed shall cross any railroad,  it  shall  do  so
      above  or below such railroad and not upon the same level. The plans and
      specifications for any highways required to  be  constructed  under  the
      provisions  of this section shall be approved by the state department of
      transportation.
        b. The  commissioner  of  environmental  protection  shall  make  such
      reasonable  rules and regulations, not in conflict with the highway law,
      as may be necessary to prevent improper and destructive use of  highways
      and bridges constructed under the provisions of the water supply laws of
      the  city  of  New  York.  Provided,  however,  that the commissioner of
      environmental protection shall have  no  greater  authority  in  respect
      thereto  than  is now, or may hereafter be, vested by the highway law of
      the state of New York in  the  town,  county  or  state  authorities  in
      relation  to  the  construction and regulation of town, county and state
      highways. Any individual or corporation failing to  observe  such  rules
      and regulations shall be guilty of a misdemeanor and, in addition, shall
      be  liable  for  actual  damages  to  such  highways  and bridges, to be
      recovered by the city.
        c. The state commissioner of transportation, in his or her discretion,
      shall have the power to perform, at the request of the  commissioner  of
      environmental  protection  and  at  the expense of the city, any work of
      original construction of substituting routes required to be performed by
      the city pursuant to this section. Whenever the  state  commissioner  of
      transportation  shall  grant  such  a  request  of  the  commissioner of
      environmental protection, he or she shall prepare  and  submit  to  such
      commissioner  of  environmental  protection  for  his or her approval an
      estimate of the cost of performing such  work.  Such  estimate  of  cost
      shall be an estimate of the cost of performing such work of construction
      pursuant   to   plans,   designs  and  specifications  prepared  by  the
      commissioner of environmental  protection  and  approved  by  the  state
      commissioner   of   transportation,  and  shall  include  all  costs  in
      connection  with  performing  such  work,   including   the   costs   of
      engineering, auditing and administration. Upon approval of such estimate
      by   the  commissioner  of  environmental  protection,  the  city  shall
      thereupon deposit with the  state  comptroller,  who  is  authorized  to
      receive  and accept the same, for the purpose of this subdivision, a sum
      of money equal to such estimate, which shall be subject to the draft  or
      requisition  of  the  state commissioner of transportation and a copy of
      the  resolution  of  such  commissioner  of   environmental   protection
      authorizing  such  deposit shall be filed with the state commissioner of
      transportation and with the state comptroller. If, at any time prior  to
      the award of a contract for the performance of such work or prior to the
      state  commissioner of transportation becoming obligated to award such a
      contract, it appears to such commissioner  of  environmental  protection
      that  the  state commissioner of transportation, for any reason, will be
      unable to award a contract for the performance of such work or  that  it
      is  undesirable  that  such  a  contract  be awarded, any sum or sums so
      deposited by  the  city,  less  the  amount  of  cost  which  the  state
      commissioner  of  transportation  has already incurred, if any, shall be
      refunded to the city by  the  state  comptroller  upon  demand  of  such
      commissioner  of  environmental protection made to the state comptroller
    
      and to the state commissioner of transportation. The performance of  any
      such  work  of  construction  shall be by contract, to be let, so far as
      practicable, in the manner  provided  by  section  thirty-eight  of  the
      highway  law,  which  section  shall,  so  far  as practicable, apply to
      contracts hereunder and payments thereon. Such contract shall be subject
      to and in conformity with such plans, designs and specifications of  the
      commissioner  of environmental protection. No contract shall be executed
      for any such work until satisfactory proof has  been  furnished  to  the
      state  commissioner  of  transportation that the city has made available
      any real property required and any easements deemed necessary. When work
      performed by the state commissioner of transportation hereunder has been
      completed  and  the  cost  thereof  paid,  the  state  commissioner   of
      transportation   shall  render  to  the  commissioner  of  environmental
      protection an itemized statement showing in full (a) the amount of money
      which has been deposited by the  city  with  the  state  comptroller  in
      connection  with  such work, and (b) all disbursements made by the state
      commissioner of transportation in connection  with  the  performance  of
      such  work. Any surplus money shall be paid to the city upon the warrant
      of the state comptroller upon vouchers therefor approved  by  the  state
      commissioner of transportation.

      not  taken  in pursuance of subchapter three-A of chapter three of title
      five  for  the  purpose  of  preserving  streams  or  watercourses  from
      pollution  or  contamination,  or  of  moving or causing to be moved any
      buildings, improvements or edifices on the  ground  that  the  same  may
      contaminate  the  water  supply,  without  making  a  provision for just
      compensation to the owner of such  buildings  or  improvements  for  the
      removal or destruction thereof.

      empower  the  city  to  prohibit  the  public  from  using such lakes or
      reservoirs  that  may  be  constructed  under  the  provisions  of  this
      subchapter,  for the purpose of ice-cutting or fishing; and the city, or
      its representatives, shall not hereafter prohibit the public from  using
      such  lakes or reservoirs which are now under the care or supervision of
      the city for the purposes of ice-cutting or fishing,  subject,  however,
      to  reasonable  rules and regulations, and subject however, to the right
      of the city to prohibit such use in the event of the declaration  of  an
      emergency as provided in section 24-326 of this code.
