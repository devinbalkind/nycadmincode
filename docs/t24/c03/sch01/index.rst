      department of environmental protection, or the fire department to  open,
      use, operate, or tamper with a fire hydrant or high pressure hydrant, in
      the  city,  or a valve in the water supply system of the city, without a
      permit in writing from the commissioner of environmental protection.  It
      shall  also be unlawful to leave such a hydrant open for a longer period
      than shall be limited in the permit, or use  water  for  other  purposes
      than shall have been authorized by such commissioner.
        b.  The  commissioner  may  grant  a permit to a person, other than an
      employee of the department of environmental protection or  of  the  fire
      department,  to  open,  use  or operate a fire hydrant in the city, upon
      such terms and conditions as may be prescribed by the  commissioner  and
      upon payment by such permittee of a fee of five dollars for each day for
      which such permit is granted. A permittee shall be required, at the time
      of  making  application  for such permit, to pay to the department a sum
      sufficient to cover the total fee for the entire period for  which  such
      permit  is  granted.  If  the  work  for which such permit is granted is

      permittee  shall  be  entitled  to a refund of the fee paid for each day
      subsequent to such completion date. The commissioner may grant a  permit
      pursuant  to  this section to any agency or to a non-profit organization
      for the purpose  of  providing  street  showers  for  children,  without
      payment of the fee required by this subdivision.

      the board of estimate, to increase the amount of the fee  prescribed  by

      city of the supervision and inspection of hydrants  in  connection  with
      the granting of permits under the provisions of this section.
        d.  Every  permittee  shall  open,  use  or  operate  such  hydrant in
      accordance with such rules and regulations and such terms and conditions
      as may be prescribed by the commissioner for the purpose  of  protecting
      and  maintaining  the  hydrant  in  a continuously accessible and usable
      condition. A permit granted pursuant to this section may be  revoked  by
      the  commissioner for the failure by the permittee to comply with any of
      the terms and conditions of the permit or any  applicable  provision  of
      law.
        e.  The  opening,  use  or operation of a fire hydrant, under a permit
      issued pursuant to this section, shall be subject to  inspection  by  an
      employee  or  employees  of  the department of environmental protection,
      duly appointed in accordance with the provisions of  the  civil  service
      law,  and  assigned  to such duties in accordance with the provisions of
      section eleven hundred three of the charter.  The  compensation  of  any
      such  employee or employees shall be paid by the city in accordance with
      the provisions of section one hundred twenty-three of  the  charter.  No
      permittee  shall be required to pay the compensation of any employee, or
      any part thereof, as a condition to the granting of  a  permit  for  the
      opening, use or operation of a fire hydrant.

--------------

Section 24-316 ::    
        
     
        §  24-316  Leaking  tap  or service pipe to be repaired. a. As used in
      this section:
        1. "tap" means a connection made between a  city-owned  pipe  or  main
      supplying water and a service pipe.
        2.  "service  pipe"  means  a pipe used to carry water from a tap to a
      house control valve, a building or other enclosure or a point  at  which
      the water supply is fully metered.
        b.  When  a  test  made  by the department of environmental protection
      indicates that there is a leak at  a  tap  or  in  a  service  pipe,  if
      conditions  permit, a notice shall be served by a representative of such
      department upon the owner or occupant of the premises being supplied  by
      such  tap  or  service  pipe. The notice shall direct that all necessary
      repairs be made to stop the leak.
        c. In the event that a tap is shut off by the department because of  a
      leak,  the  owner or occupant of the affected premises shall be notified
      that the tap has been closed and  that  a  licensed  plumber  should  be
      engaged  to  make  the  necessary  repair  and take charge of the street
      excavation. If the owner or  occupant  fails  within  three  days  after
      notice,  excepting  emergencies  as  determined  by  the commissioner to
      engage  a  licensed  plumber,  the  tap  shall  remain  closed  and  the
      department of environmental protection shall backfill the excavation.
    
    
    
    
    
    
    

Section 24-317
--------------

Section 24-317 ::    
        
     
        §  24-317  Lien  on premises. a. There shall be filed in the office of
      the department of environmental protection a record of all  work  caused
      to  be  performed  by  or  on  behalf of the department which relates to
      section 24-316 of this code. Such records shall be kept on a building by
      building basis and shall be accessible to  the  public  during  business
      hours.  Within  thirty days after the issuance of an order to shut off a
      tap, or backfill an excavation, or both, entry of such  order  shall  be
      made  on the records of the department of environmental protection. Such
      entry shall constitute notice to all parties.
        b. All expenses incurred  by  or  on  behalf  of  the  department  for
      services  performed  pursuant  to  section  24-316  of  this  code shall
      constitute a lien upon the land and buildings  upon  or  in  respect  to
      which,  or  either  of  which,  the work required by such order has been
      done, or expenses incurred, when the  amount  thereof  shall  have  been
      definitely computed as a statement of account by the department and such
      department  shall  cause to be filed in the office of the city collector
      an entry of the account stated in the book in which such charges against
      the premises are to be entered. Such lien shall have a priority over all
      other  liens  and  encumbrances  except  for  the  lien  of  taxes   and
      assessments.  However, no lien created pursuant to this section shall be
      enforced against a subsequent purchaser in good faith  or  mortgagee  in
      good  faith unless the requirements of subdivision a of this section are
      satisfied; this limitation shall only apply  to  transactions  occurring
      after  the  date  such  record  should  have  been  entered  pursuant to
      subdivision a and the date such entry was made.
        c. A notice thereof, stating the amount due  and  the  nature  of  the
      charge,  shall  be  mailed by the city collector, within five days after
      such entry, to the last known address of the person whose  name  appears
      on the records in the office of the city collector as being the owner or
      agent  or as the person designated by the owner to receive tax bills or,
      where no name appears, to the premises, addressed to either the owner or
      the agent.
        (d) If such charge is not paid within thirty days  from  the  date  of
      entry,  it  shall  be the duty of the city collector to receive interest
      thereon at the rate of  interest  applicable  to  such  property  for  a
      delinquent tax on real property, to be calculated to the date of payment
      from the date of entry.
        e.  Such  charge  and the interest thereon shall continue to be, until
      paid, a lien on the premises. Such lien shall be a tax lien  within  the
      meaning  of  sections  11-319  and  11-401  of the code and may be sold,
      enforced or foreclosed in the manner provided in chapters three and four
      of title eleven of such code or may be satisfied in accordance with  the
      provisions  of  section thirteen hundred fifty-four of the real property
      actions and proceedings law.
        f. Such notice mailed by the city collector pursuant to  this  section
      shall have stamped or printed thereon a reference to this section of the
      code.

Section 24-318 ::

      proceedings to enforce or discharge a lien created pursuant  to  section
      24-317 of this subchapter, the validity of the lien shall not be subject
      to challenge based on:
        (1) The lawfulness of the work done; or
        (2)  The  propriety  and accuracy of the items of expenses for which a
      lien is claimed, except as provided in this section.
        b. No such challenge may be made  except  by  (1)  the  owner  of  the
      property,  or (2) a mortagee or lienor whose mortgage or lien would, but
      for the provisions of section 24-317 of this subchapter,  have  priority
      over the department's lien.

      agencies  to  make any contract in relation to the water supply with any
      person, except in accordance with the provisions and requirements of the
      charter and this code.  Such  provisions  and  requirements  are  hereby
      declared  to  establish  the  exclusive  rule  for  the  making  of such
      contracts. All proceedings relating to the making  or  approval  of  any
      such  contract  may be reviewed by the appellate division of the supreme
      court in the first or  second  department  on  the  application  of  any

      agreements for a term of years with any corporation duly organized under
      the  laws  of  this state, for the furnishing of a special water service
      for fire, sanitary and other purposes, and for supplying water  suitable
      therefor  from  any  source  with  a  pressure  equal to a head of three
      hundred feet above tide  water.  Such  contracts  and  agreements  shall
      contain  such  conditions, provisions and stipulations as such board may
      consider necessary and proper in the interests of the city, and shall be
      upon such terms as it deems best. Such  board,  by  such  contract,  may
      authorize  such  corporation to lay down pipes and erect hydrants in the
      streets of the city, under such restrictions and conditions  as  may  be
      prescribed by such board.

      the city of all the rights and property secured by such corporation  and
      the  works  constructed  by  them  for furnishing water for such special
      purposes, when such board of estimate shall deem such purchase to be for
      the interest of the city. Such purchase,  however,  must  be  determined
      upon  by such board at the expiration of five years from the date of the
      contract. The cost of such purchase shall be determined  by  arbitrators
      appointed by the supreme court.

      by law, relating to procuring an increased  supply  of  water  from  the

      supply.  a.  Any natural lake or any reservoir used or built by the city
      for water supply purposes may be used by the public for boating, cutting
      ice and fishing. The city and its  representatives  shall  not  prohibit
      such  use,  and  they  are  required  to  afford access to such lakes or
      reservoirs, except that the city may prohibit such use in the event of a
      declaration of an emergency by the governor as hereinafter provided  and
      except  in  the event of the declaration of war by or against the United
      States of America. The city may grant permits to boat owners for the use
      of boats on such lakes and  reservoirs,  and  may  prescribe  rules  and
      regulations for their proper use.
        b.  If any emergency shall have been declared to exist by the governor
      in the manner hereinafter provided in subdivision c of this  section  or
      in  the event of a declaration of war by or against the United States of
      America, the mayor, for the duration of such emergency or of  such  war,
      may revoke, in whole or in part, the privileges set forth in subdivision
      a  hereof and prohibit the use by the public of the lakes and reservoirs
      of the city. The commissioner may make reasonable rules and  regulations
      as  to  the  use of such reservoirs during such emergency or war period.
      Any such order of revocation  shall  define  the  terms  and  extent  of
      revocation, and shall state the date on which it shall become effective.
      Any   rules   and   regulations   promulgated  by  the  commissioner  of
      environmental protection during such emergency shall be  published  once
      in  a  newspaper  circulating in each of the counties in which the water
      supply property to be affected thereby shall be located.
        c. The governor is hereby empowered to declare  the  existence  of  an
      emergency  affecting the city's water supply sources upon application of
      the  commissioner  of  environmental  protection  and  subject  to   the
      following conditions:
        1.  Notice  of  the  application  by  the  commissioner  to  have such
      emergency declared and of the date and place of the public hearing to be
      had thereon shall be published at least twice in a  newspaper  published
      in  each  county  in which are located the sources of water supply as to
      which it is claimed the emergency exists and in addition written  notice
      of  such  application  and  of the date and place of the hearing thereon
      shall be served on the clerk of the board of supervisors  of  each  such
      county at least eight days before such hearing.
        2.  After  such  public hearing, at which all persons interested shall
      have an opportunity to be heard, the governor, may, if he or  she  deems
      such  emergency  to  exist,  declare  the  existence  of  such emergency
      affecting the city's water supply sources and fix the period  for  which
      the  emergency  shall be deemed to exist. The duration of such period of
      emergency may be extended after the giving of similar notice  and  after
      holding of a similar public hearing.
        3.  Notwithstanding  the  requirements  of  paragraphs  one and two of
      subdivision c of this section, the governor  shall  have  the  power  to
      declare  the existence of an emergency affecting the city's water supply
      sources or any part thereof upon application of the commissioner without
      notice, and without a public hearing for a period not  exceeding  thirty
      days.  Where  such  emergency  is  so declared, however, it shall not be
      extended or renewed except after notice and public hearing  as  provided
      in such paragraphs one and two.
        d.  In the event of the declaration of an emergency by the governor or
      of the declaration of war by or against the United  States  of  America,
      duly  designated employees of the department of environmental protection
      are empowered and authorized to act as peace officers in any  county  in
      which  any  water supply property of the city is located for the purpose
      of enforcing the rules and regulations promulgated by  the  commissioner
    
      for  the  period  of  the  emergency.  The  department  of environmental
      protection shall file in the office of the sheriff of each such county a
      certificate of appointment of each such designated employee,  and  shall
      attach  to  each  such  certificate  a  complete  copy  of the rules and
      regulations promulgated  pursuant  to  subdivisions  a  and  b  of  this
      section. Copies of all amendments of such rules and regulations shall be
      filed  by  the  commissioner  with each such sheriff. The sheriff of any
      such county may cancel any such certificate  for  cause,  and  forthwith
      shall  mail  written  notice  of  such cancellation to the department of
      environmental protection,  specifying  the  cause  of  such  revocation.
      Immediately  upon  any such cancellation, the employee whose certificate
      shall have been cancelled, shall have no further authority to act  as  a
      peace  officer.  Each  employee  so appointed at all times when on duty,
      shall have in his or her possession a shield or other suitable badge  of
      authority  which  he  or  she  shall  exhibit at once to any person upon
      request.
        e. It shall be the special duty  of  the  employees  so  appointed  to
      prevent  breaches  of  the peace and unlawful depredations and to arrest
      and bring before the  proper  judicial  officer  any  person  guilty  of
      violating any of such rules and regulations.
        f.  Any person convicted of violating any of the rules and regulations
      promulgated pursuant to subdivision a of this section shall be  punished
      by  a  fine  of  not more than ten dollars for the first offense, twenty
      dollars or ten days imprisonment, or both, for the  second  offense,  or
      fifty  dollars or fifty days imprisonment, or both, for the third or any
      subsequent offense.

      authorized to install or cause to be installed water meters, the pattern
      and maximum price of which shall be approved by the board of estimate in
      any  or all stores, workshops, hotels, lodging houses, factories, office
      buildings, and public edifices, at wharves, ferry houses,  and  stables,
      and  in  all places in which water is furnished for business consumption
      and in any or all new or substantially improved  or  altered  dwellings.
      When  authorized  thereto  by  resolution of the board of estimate or by
      local law, the commissioner may install such meters in any or all  other
      multiple  dwellings, and he or she shall install such meter or meters or
      cause them to be installed upon written demand of the owner of  any  lot
      or premises to which such water is supplied.
        (2) For purposes of this subdivision an improvement or alteration is a
      physical  change in an existing structure, other than painting, ordinary
      repairs and normal replacement of maintenance items. A  structure  shall
      be deemed to have been substantially improved or altered where:

      department   to  such  premises  in  ratable  proportion  to  the  water
      furnished, as ascertained by meter, subject to such minimum and  service
      charges as may be established. All expense and cost of meters, and their
      connections,  and  of their setting, repair and maintenance, unless with
      the approval of the board of estimate such expense and cost be borne  by
      the department, shall be a charge and lien upon the premises.
        c.  This  section  shall  not, however, be construed so as to remit or
      prevent  the  due  collection  of  arrearages  or  charges   for   water
      consumption  heretofore  incurred,  nor  interfere with the proper liens
      therefor, nor of charges, or rates, or liens hereafter  to  be  incurred

Section 24-337 ::    
        
     
        §  24-337 Waste of water prohibited; remedies. a. It shall be unlawful
      for water to be wasted, whether owing to  leak  or  wasteful  condition,
      regardless  of  fault,  from  any  water  pipe,  valve, faucet, conduit,
      equipment, facility or device connected to  the  city  water  system  or
      which  utilizes  city  water.  It shall be the duty of an owner, lessee,
      agent, manager, operator and of any other person in charge of or who has
      control  over  any  premises,  plant,  equipment,  facility,  device  or
      operation  to  make  frequent  regular inspections so as to minimize the
      likelihood of leak or waste and  within  a  reasonable  time  after  the
      discovery  or  notification  of any leak or wasteful condition to effect
      repairs or take other appropriate corrective action within the power  of
      such   person.   The  commissioner  of  environmental  protection  shall
      promulgate such reasonable rules and regulations as the commissioner may
      from time to time deem appropriate for the prevention of  the  waste  of
      water.
        b.   In  addition  to  enforcement  pursuant  to  section  24-346  the
      commissioner may serve a leak and waste notice upon any person having  a
      duty  to  repair  or  correct  a  leak or wasteful condition or upon any
      person in violation of the rules and regulations for the  prevention  of
      the  waste  of water. Such notice shall specify the repair or correction
      to be made and shall fix a reasonable time for  compliance.  Where  such
      notice  has  been served and water continues to be wasted after the time
      for correction has expired, the commissioner may, after  notice  and  an
      opportunity  for  a  hearing  before  the  commissioner  or  his  or her
      designee, turn off the water supply to the premises or impose a  penalty
      not to exceed fifty dollars per day for each day that water continues to
      be  wasted  after  the expiration date contained in the notice, or both.
      Any penalty imposed pursuant to this section may be added to  the  water
      rents;  except  that no such penalty may be imposed against any property
      unless both the leak and waste notice and notice of  the  proceeding  to
      impose  the  penalty was served upon the owner by mailing copies thereof
      to the person whose name appears on the records in  the  office  of  the
      city  collector  as being the owner or agent or as the person designated
      by the owner to receive tax bills  at  the  address  on  file  for  such
      purpose or where no name appears to the property addressed to "owner" or
      "agent" and such person has had an opportunity to be heard.
        The provisions of this subdivision shall not be construed to limit the
      commissioner's  power  to  shut off water supply without notice, or with
      such notice as the commissioner  may  deem  practicable,  where  a  leak
      exists; or where emergency action is otherwise deemed essential.
        (c)   The  department  shall  establish  or  reestablish  a  permanent
      committee on water conservation (the "committee") within six  months  of
      the  effective  date  of  this  section  consisting  of outside experts,
      representatives  of  public  interest,  environmental  and  professional
      groups  and  interested  citizens, two of whom shall be appointed by the
      city council and the rest shall be appointed by  the  commissioner.  The
      members  of the committee shall serve without compensation for a term of
      three years. The commissioner shall be the chairman.
        (d) Within one year after the effective  date  of  this  section,  and
      annually  thereafter,  the  committee shall submit to the city council a
      report evaluating the  effectiveness  of  paragraphs  a  through  e,  of
      subdivision  P.104.2  of  section  P.104.0  RS  16 describing the latest
      available   water-conserving    fixtures,    and    including    written
      recommendations.  The  department  shall make available to the committee
      any and all information  useful  and  necessary  for  the  committee  to
      prepare  and  complete the report for submission to the city council. To
      prepare such report the committee shall utilize any  information  and/or
      materials   determined   to  be  pertinent  that  have  been  published,
    
      distributed or in any other manner made available from  state  agencies,
      public  and  private  research  groups, multi-state agencies such as the
      Delaware River Basin Commission, and other  similar  public  or  private
      agencies  or  groups  with  expertise  with  respect to water-conserving
      plumbing fixtures. The report shall include, but not be limited to:
        (1) a review of compliance with paragraphs a through e, of subdivision
      P.104.2 of section P.104.0 of reference standard RS 16 of  the  appendix
      to  chapter  one  of title twenty-seven of this code, the impact of such
      compliance, and the relationship of the standards set  forth  herein  to
      current technology;
        (2)  recommendations as to the feasibility of requiring more stringent
      water-saving performance standards than provided in paragraphs a through
      e of subdivision P.104.2 of section P.104.0 of reference standard RS 16.
        (e) The department shall establish a  city-wide  comprehensive  public
      information campaign focusing on water-conserving fixtures, the benefits
      of  good  water-saving equipment, and the opportunity for rapid pay-back
      and long-term money savings, especially in energy costs, for home owners
      and landlords. Within six  months  after  the  effective  date  of  this
      section,  a  proposal  for  the  public  information  campaign  shall be
      submitted to the city council for review and commentary. The  department
      shall  report  annually  to the city council on the status of the public
      information campaign.

        §  24-343 Transfer of house service pipe connection to new water main.
      a.  In instances where the city has laid a water main in a street  where
      surface  grades have been established but where the surface has not been
      improved to the established grade and when a new water main is installed
      by the city because it is required by the grading of such street to  the
      established  grade,  the  commissioner of environmental protection shall
      issue an order directing the owner of  each  house  which  was  directly
      connected  with  the  main  as  previously  laid,  to transfer the house
      service pipe connection to the new main, at the expense  of  such  owner
      when  required  in  accordance  with  the  rules  and regulations of the
      commissioner.
        b. When a new water main is installed by the city to replace a private
      main, the commissioner shall issue an order directing the owner of  each
      house  fronting  on  the city main and receiving water from such private
      main to transfer the house service pipe connection to the city main,  at
      the  expense  of  such  owner  and  in  accordance  with  the  rules and
      regulations of the commissioner.
        c. An order issued pursuant to this section shall be served  upon  the
      owner of the premises, by registered mail sent to the address registered
      by  such  owner  in  the bureau of city collections in the department of
      finance, or if no address is registered in such  bureau,  by  registered
      mail  sent to the last known address of such owner, or to the address of
      such owner as shown on the records in the office  where  conveyances  of
      real property are recorded pursuant to law.
        d.  If  the  transfer is not made within ten days after the mailing of
      such order, the department of environmental  protection  may  make  such
      transfer through its officers, agents or contractors. The owner shall be
      personally  liable  for  the  expenses and disbursements incurred by the
      department in making such transfer. The  amount  of  such  expenses  and
      disbursements  shall  be  due  and  payable when definitely fixed by the
      commissioner of environmental protection and entered upon the records in
      the office of the city collector. A notice stating the  amount  due  and
      the  nature  of  the charge shall be mailed by the city collector within
      five days after such entry to the address registered by  such  owner  in
      the  bureau  of  city collections in the department of finance, or if no
      address is registered in such bureau, to the last known address  of  the
      owner  of  such property or to the address of such owner as shown on the
      records in the office where conveyances of real  property  are  recorded
      pursuant to law. If such amount is not paid on or before the last day of
      the month following the month of entry, it shall be the duty of the city
      collector to charge, collect and receive interest thereon at the rate of
      seven  per  cent  per annum to be calculated to the date of payment from
      the date of entry. The amount of such expenses and disbursements and the
      interest thereon shall be  a  lien  upon  the  premises  for  which  the
      transfer  of  the  house  service pipe connection was made, and shall be
      enforced and collected in the manner provided in chapter three of  title
      eleven  of  this  code for the enforcement and collection of water rents
      and the lien thereof.

Section 24-343.1 ::    
        
     
        §  24-343.1  Backflow  prevention device reporting. a. For purposes of
      this section the following terms shall have the following meanings:
        (1) "Backflow" shall mean a flow condition, induced by a  differential
      in pressure, that causes the flow of water or other liquids and/or gases
      into the distribution of pipes of a city water main, private water main,
      or  to  an  internal  water main from any source other than its intended
      source.
        (2)  "Backsiphonage"  shall  mean  the  backflow  of  contaminated  or
      polluted water, or water of questionable quality from a plumbing fixture
      or  other  source,  into a city water main, private water main, or to an
      internal water main due  to  a  temporary  negative  or  sub-atmospheric
      pressure within the public water supply system.
        (3)  "Backflow  prevention  device"  shall  mean  an approved air gap,
      reduced pressure zone device or double  check  valve  assembly  used  to
      contain potential contamination within a facility.
        (4) "Cross connection" shall mean a physical connection or arrangement
      between  two  separate  piping systems where one system contains potable
      water and the other  contains  steam,  gas,  a  chemical,  or  water  of
      questionable  safety,  and  there  may  be a flow from one system to the
      other.
        (5) "Hazardous facility" shall mean a facility in which substances may
      be present that  may  endanger  the  health  of  other  water  users  if
      introduced  into  the public water system, including but not limited to,
      laboratories, sewage treatment plants, chemical  plants,  hospitals  and
      mortuaries.
        b.  When  the  department  or  the  owner or operator of a building or
      structure has determined  that  there  is  a  cross  connection  and  no
      backflow  prevention  device,  or a defective or unapproved device, such
      that there is a possibility  of  backflow  or  backsiphonage  from  such
      building  or structure into a city water main, private water main, or to
      an internal water main, the  owner  or  operator  of  such  building  or
      structure  shall  be  under  a  duty to correct such potential or actual
      backflow or  backsiphonage  and  provide  the  proper  documentation  to
      certify  to  the  department  that a backflow prevention device has been
      installed and where appropriate, that a backflow prevention  device  has
      been  replaced.  Where  removal of a cross-connection or installation or
      replacement of a backflow prevention device has been performed  as  part
      of  a  project  for which a licensed professional engineer or registered
      architect has submitted plans that have been approved by the department,
      such  licensed  professional  engineer  or  registered  architect  shall
      inspect   and   submit  to  the  department  a  certification  that  the
      cross-connection has  been  removed  or  a  backflow  prevention  device
      installed   or  replaced  in  conformity  with  plans  approved  by  the
      department or the department of buildings.
        c. The department shall send out  a  mailing  to  or  shall  otherwise
      notify owners or operators of facilities identified by the department as
      potentially  requiring backflow prevention devices informing them of the
      potential need for such a device and of the process for installation  of
      backflow  prevention  devices under the auspices of the cross connection
      control program. The  materials  contained  in  such  mailing  shall  be
      translated  into  such  languages provided for in section 8-1002 of this
      code.
        d. On or before January 1, 2010, the department shall submit a  report
      to  the council setting forth the number of hazardous facilities and all
      other facilities which the department knows have had  required  backflow
      prevention  devices  installed  and  the  number  of  facilities in each
      category that have been notified  by  the  department  of  the  need  to
      install  one  or  more backflow prevention devices. Every July first and
    
      January first thereafter, the department shall submit a  report  to  the
      council  setting  forth  the  number  of facilities in each category for
      which one or more backflow prevention devices were installed  since  the
      last report was required, the number of facilities in each category that
      have  been  newly notified by the department of the need to install such
      devices, and the number of violations issued by the department  for  the
      failure to install a required backflow prevention device.

        §  24-346  Enforcement  and  penalties.  a.  Notwithstanding any other
      provision of law, the commissioner of environmental protection  and  the
      environmental control board shall enforce the provisions of this chapter
      and  chapter four of this title and the regulations promulgated pursuant
      thereto or pursuant to section fourteen hundred three of  the  New  York

      provisions.
        b. Any person who  violates  or  fails  to  comply  with  any  of  the
      provisions  of this chapter and chapter four of this title or any order,
      rule or regulation issued by the  board  or  commissioner  or  with  the
      conditions  of  any permit issued by the commissioner within the city of
      New York shall be liable for a civil penalty of not less than fifty  nor
      more than one thousand dollars for each violation, except that the civil
      penalty  for  the  removal  of  a  manhole cover in violation of section
      24-304 shall be not less than two thousand five hundred dollars nor more
      then ten thousand dollars. In the case of a  continuing  violation  each
      day's  continuance  shall  be  a  separate  and  distinct  offense.  The
      environmental control board shall have the power to  impose  such  civil
      penalties.  A  proceeding to impose such penalties shall be commenced by
      the service of a notice of violation  returnable  to  such  board.  Such
      board,  after  a hearing as provided by the rules and regulations of the
      board, shall have the power to enforce its final  decisions  and  orders
      imposing  such  civil penalties as if they were money judgments pursuant
      to subdivision d of section one thousand forty-nine-a of  the  New  York
      city charter. A civil penalty imposed by the board may also be collected
      in  an  action brought in the name of the city in any court of competent
      jurisdiction.  The board, in its discretion, may, within the limits  set
      forth  in  this  subdivision,  establish  a  schedule of civil penalties
      indicating the minimum and maximum penalty for each separate offense.
        c. In addition to the civil penalties set forth in  subdivision  b  of
      this  section  and except as otherwise specifically provided, any person
      who knowingly violates or fails to comply with  any  provision  of  this
      chapter  and chapter four of this title or any order, rule or regulation
      issued by the commissioner or board or with the conditions of any permit
      issued by the commissioner shall be guilty of a  misdemeanor  and,  upon
      conviction  thereof,  shall  be  punished by a fine of not less than two
      hundred fifty nor more than one thousand dollars, or by imprisonment not
      exceeding thirty days, or both  for  each  violation,  except  that  the

      than ten thousand dollars, or imprisonment not exceeding thirty days, or
      both  for  each  violation.  In  the case of a continuing violation each
      day's continuance shall be a separate and distinct offense.
        d. 1. In the case of any continued or knowing violation of any of  the
      provisions  of this chapter and chapter four of this title or any order,
      rule or regulation issued  by  the  board  or  commissioner  or  of  the
      conditions  of  any permit issued by the commissioner within the city of
      New York or where the board finds that the  violation  of  any  of  such
      provisions  or  of  the  conditions  of  any such permit presents or may
      present a danger to the water supply or the  water  supply  system,  the
      board  after notice and the opportunity for a hearing in accordance with
      the rules and regulations of the board, may issue  a  cease  and  desist
      order  requiring  any  person  who  owns,  leases, operates, controls or
      supervises  any  building,  structure,  facility,   device,   equipment,
      installation  or  operation  to  cease  and  desist from any activity or
    
      process which causes or is conducted  so  as  to  cause  such  violation
      within the time specified in such order.
        2. Such order may provide that if the order is not complied with or so
      far  complied  with  as the commissioner of environmental protection may
      regard as reasonable within the time specified therein, the commissioner
      may take such action as shall be specified therein,  including  but  not
      limited to:
        (a)  sealing,  blocking  or  inactivating  any  equipment, facility or
      device; or
        (b) terminating the water supply.
        For such purpose the commissioner or his or her deputies or such other
      officers or employees as are designated by the commissioner may enter on
      any public or private property.
        e. 1. Whenever the commissioner has reasonable cause to believe that a
      violation of the provisions of this chapter and  chapter  four  of  this
      title  or  any  order,  rule  or  regulation  issued  by  the  board  or
      commissioner or in violation of the conditions of any permit  issued  by
      the  commissioner  within  the city of New York creates or may create an
      imminent danger to the water supply or to the water supply system or  to
      the  public health or to the life or safety of persons, the commissioner
      may issue a cease and  desist  order  requiring  any  person  who  owns,
      leases,  operates,  controls  or  supervises  any  building,  structure,
      facility, device, equipment, installation  or  operation  to  take  such
      action as may be necessary to halt or prevent such violation.
        2.  If  service  of  the  order cannot be made personally because such
      person cannot be located at such  time  then  service  may  be  made  by
      delivering  a  copy  to  a  person of suitable age and discretion at the
      residence or place of business of the person sought  to  be  served.  If
      service  cannot  be  made  personally or by such delivery to a person of
      suitable age and discretion because of inability to locate or to  obtain
      the  name or address of such person at such time, service may be made by
      conspicuously posting a copy of such order upon the property to which it
      relates. The posting of such order shall be sufficient  notice  of  such
      order  to  all  persons  having  a  duty  in  relation thereto under the
      provisions of this subdivision.
        3. If the order is not complied with or so far complied  with  as  the
      commissioner may regard as reasonable, within the time specified therein
      the commissioner may act to halt or prevent such violation by:
        (a)   sealing,  blocking  or  otherwise  inactivating  any  equipment,
      facility or device;
        (b) terminating the water supply; or
        (c)  any  other  means  or  method  that  is  reasonable   under   the
      circumstances.  For such purpose the commissioner or his or her deputies
      or  such  other  officers  or  employees  as  are  designated   by   the
      commissioner may enter on any public or private property.
        4.  Any  person affected by such an order may make written application
      to the environmental control board for a hearing. Such hearing shall  be
      provided,  pursuant to the rules and regulations of the board, and shall
      be held within forty-eight hours after the receipt of such  application.
      The board may suspend, modify or terminate such order.
        f.  If  the  respondent  fails  to comply with any order issued by the
      board or commissioner or with the conditions of any permit, or the board
      or commissioner otherwise deems it necessary, the  corporation  counsel,
      acting  in the name of the city, may maintain an action or proceeding in
      a court of competent jurisdiction to compel compliance with or  restrain
      by  injunction  the violation of any order or permit issued by the board
      or commissioner.
    
        g. Any person who  violates  or  fails  to  comply  with  any  of  the
      provisions  of this chapter and chapter four of this title or any order,
      rule or regulation or with the conditions of any permit  issued  by  the
      commissioner shall be liable to the city for any expense, loss or damage
      suffered by the city by reason of such violation.
        h.  Unless  otherwise  specifically provided, service of any notice or
      order may be made either personally or by mail  addressed  to  the  last
      known address of the person to be served.
