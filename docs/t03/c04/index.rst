Section 3-405 ::    
        
     
        §  3-405  Awards  for death or injuries received by persons other than
      peace officers while attempting to prevent the commission  of  a  crime,
      preserve  the peace or prevent public disturbances. Direct action on the
      part of private citizens in preventing  crimes  against  the  person  or
      property   of   others,   preserving  the  peace  or  preventing  public
      disturbances, benefits the entire public. The mayor is hereby authorized
      and empowered to make an award for the death of or injury to any  person
      or persons, other than police officers or peace officers, which has been
      or  shall hereafter be caused in attempting to prevent the commission of
      a crime against the person or property of another, preserve the peace or
      prevent public disturbances. Such award shall be fixed in the discretion
      of the mayor as a matter of grace and not as  a  matter  of  right,  and
      shall,  in  the  case  of  personal  injuries, be based upon the medical
      expenses and loss of earnings incurred  by  such  person  injured  while
      attempting  to  prevent the commission of a crime, preserve the peace or
      prevent public disturbances. In the case of the death  of  such  person,
      such  award  shall  be made to the surviving spouse or domestic partner,
      child or other dependent of such person; and  the  award  may  be  in  a
      single  payment,  or  may  be made in periodic payments under provisions
      similar to those set  forth  in  section  13-244  of  this  code,  which
      periodic  payments may be in an amount not to exceed the amounts payable
      pursuant to such section  as  a  pension  to  the  surviving  spouse  or
      domestic  partner,  child  or  other dependent, as the case may be, of a
      deceased first-grade police officer. Petitions for  an  award  hereunder
      must  be presented to the mayor within six months after the happening of
      the occurrence which resulted in such injury or death. Before the  mayor
      shall make such payment, he or she shall require the claimant to execute
      and deliver an assignment to the city, in such form as shall be approved
      by  the  corporation counsel, of an amount equal to the payments made or
      to be made by the city, payable out of the  proceeds  of  any  recovery,
      whether  by  judgment,  settlement or otherwise, against the city or any
      person or any  public  or  private  corporation  alleged  to  have  been
      responsible for said death or injuries.

      property  for  the  purposes of the city or any of the counties therein,
      including the premises required in accordance with law for armories  and
      drill rooms and places of deposit for the safekeeping of arms, uniforms,
      equipment,  accoutrements  and camp equipage of the national guard, must
      be presented to and passed upon by the board  of  estimate.  The  board,
      upon  the  report of the commissioner of general services, and upon such
      further inquiry  as  such  board,  in  its  discretion,  may  make,  may
      authorize  a  lease  of  such  premises  as  shall  be  specified in its
      resolution, at the rent therein set forth for  a  period  not  exceeding
      twenty-one  years.  Such  lease  may  contain  a  provision for renewals
      thereof at the option of the city. Such lease,  however,  shall  not  be
      authorized except at a fair and reasonable rent, and unless the board is
      satisfied,  and  shall  so express, that it would be for the interest of
      the city that a lease of the premises for the purposes specified  should
      be  made.  If  the  city,  prior  to the making of the lease, shall have
      entered upon the possession of the property, the lease may  be  made  to
      commence as of the date when the occupation commenced.
