      providing  essential  goods,  services  or  construction  such  as those
      necessary for security or other essential  government  operations.  Such
      rules  shall  provide  that  the  city  chief  procurement officer shall
      transmit to the board a copy of any application for  a  waiver  and  any
      such  waiver may not be granted prior to the expiration of ten days from
    
      the date such application is received by the  board.  Such  rules  shall
      also  provide that any such waiver may be granted only after substantial
      efforts have been made by the city chief procurement officer  to  obtain
      the information required by this law. Such rules shall also provide that
      the  city  chief  procurement  officer  may grant the waiver only upon a
      finding that it is in the best interests  of  the  city,  which  finding
      shall  only  be made upon a determination that (i) there is a compelling
      need to obtain such essential goods, services or construction  from  the
      person  seeking  the  exemption and (ii) no other reasonable alternative
      exists in light of such  considerations  as  cost,  uniqueness  and  the
      critical   nature  of  such  goods,  services  or  construction  to  the
      accomplishment of the purchasing agency's mission. Such rules  may  also
      provide  that  a  waiver  may be granted when a person is doing business
      with the city by virtue of the city's exercise of its powers of  eminent
      domain.  Any  grant  of  a  waiver shall be posted on the city's and the
      board's website in locations that are accessible by the public.
        d. A person, as defined by subdivision 20 of section 3-702,  shall  be
      considered  to  have  business dealings with the city as of the date the
      person's name is entered in the doing business database, as such date is
      indicated in such database, or the date the person began doing  business
      with  the city, as such date is indicated in such database, whichever is
      earlier, except that the date on which the person  is  considered  doing
      business  with the city shall not be earlier than thirty days before the
      date the person's name is entered into such database.
        19. The term "economic development agreement" means  any  contract  or
      agreement  in  which financial incentives including, but not limited to,
      tax incentives, payments in lieu of taxes and financing are  offered  in
      return  for  the  development,  attraction  or  retention  of  business;
      provided, however that no financial incentives  which  are  given  to  a
      person  who  qualifies  for  such incentive by operation of law shall be
      deemed to be pursuant to an economic development agreement for  purposes
      of this chapter.
        20.  The  term "doing business database" means a computerized database
      accessible to the board that contains the  names  of  persons  who  have
      business dealings with the city; provided, however, that for purposes of
      this  chapter  the  doing  business  database  shall  not be required to
      contain the names of any person whose business dealings  with  the  city
      are  solely  of  a  type for which the board has not certified that such
      database includes the names of those persons engaged  in  such  type  of
      business  dealings  with  the  city.  Such  database shall be developed,
      maintained and updated by the office of the mayor in a manner so  as  to
      ensure its reasonable accuracy and completeness; provided, however, that
      in  no  event shall such database be updated less frequently than once a
      month. Such computerized database shall contain  a  function  to  enable
      members  of the public to determine if a given person is in the database
      because such person has business dealings with the city. For purposes of
      this definition, the term "person" shall  include  an  entity  that  has
      business  dealings  with  the  city,  any chief executive officer, chief
      financial officer and/or chief  operating  officer  of  such  entity  or
      persons  serving  in  an  equivalent  capacity, any person employed in a
      senior managerial capacity regarding such entity, or any person with  an
      interest  in  such  entity  which  exceeds  ten  percent  of the entity,
      provided, however, that "entity" for purposes of this  definition  shall
      not  include a neighborhood, community or similar association consisting
      of local residents or homeowners organized on a non-profit  basis  where
      such  association  is  the  applicant  pursuant  to  subsection  (3)  of
      subdivision (a) of section 197-c of the charter or pursuant  to  section
      201 of the charter or is a parent company or an affiliated company of an
    
      entity.  For purposes of this subdivision, the phrase "senior managerial
      capacity" shall mean a high level supervisory capacity, either by virtue
      of title or duties, in which substantial  discretion  and  oversight  is
      exercised  over  the solicitation, letting or administration of business
      transactions   with   the   city,   including   contracts,   franchises,
      concessions,  grants,  economic  development agreements and applications
      for land use approvals.
        21. a. For purposes of campaigns that accept public funds pursuant  to
      section  3-705  of  this  chapter, the terms "expenditure" and "campaign
      expenditure" shall include all payments and liabilities  in  furtherance
      of  a  political campaign for covered office, including, but not limited
      to, all qualified campaign expenditures and expenditures subject  to  or
      exempt  from the expenditure limitations of this chapter. There shall be
      a  rebuttable  presumption  that  the  following  expenditures  are   in
      furtherance  of  a  political  campaign  for  elective office; provided,
      however, that the presumptions contained in this subdivision  shall  not
      apply  to  an  expenditure  to  a  person  or entity associated with the
      candidate; and provided further that in rebutting any  such  presumption
      the  campaign finance board may consider factors including the timing of
      the expenditure and whether the campaign had an unusually high amount of
      spending on a particular type  of  expenditure.  For  purposes  of  this
      subdivision a person or entity associated with a candidate shall include
      the candidate's spouse, domestic partner, child, parent, or sibling or a
      person or entity with whom or with which the candidate has a business or
      other financial relationship:
        1.  Contributions  to charitable organizations designated as 501(c)(3)

        3. Community events including, but not limited to,  events  hosted  by

      other  entertainment  events which shall be subject to the provisions of
      paragraph b;
        4.  Ballot  proposal  advocacy  where  there  are  indicia  that   the
      expenditure relates to the candidate;
        5. Travel related solely and exclusively to a political campaign for a
      covered  office or the holding of public office; provided, however, that
      any travel not related solely and exclusively to a political campaign or
      the holding of public office shall  be  subject  to  the  provisions  of
      paragraph b;
        6.  Legal  defense of a non-criminal matter arising out of a political
      campaign;
        7. Computer hardware, software and other office  technology  purchased
      more  than  two weeks before the date of a primary election, in the case
      of a candidate who is opposed in the  primary  election,  or  two  weeks
      before  the  date  of a general election, in the case of a candidate who
      was not opposed in a primary election;
        8. A post-election event for staff, volunteers and/or supporters  held
      within thirty days of the election;
        9.  Payment  of  non-criminal  penalties  or  fines  arising  out of a

        b. Campaign funds shall not be converted by any person to  a  personal
      use  which  is  unrelated  to  a political campaign. Expenditures not in
    
      furtherance of a political campaign  for  elective  office  include  the
      following:
        1. Expenditures to defray the normal living expenses of the candidate,
      immediate family of the candidate or any other individual except for the
      provision  of  such  expenses  for  professional  staff  as  part  of  a
      compensation package;
        2. Any residential or household items, supplies or expenditures;
        3. Clothing, haircuts and other personal grooming;

      associated  with  travel  that  involves  both  personal  activities and
      campaign activities, the  incremental  expenses  that  result  from  the
      personal  activities  shall  be  considered  for personal use unless the
      candidate benefiting from the use reimburses the campaign account within
      thirty days for the full amount of the incremental expenses; and
        10. Gifts, except for brochures, buttons,  signs  and  other  campaign

        ยง  3-703  Eligibility  and  other  requirements. 1. To be eligible for
      optional public financing under this chapter, a candidate for nomination
      for election or election must:
        (a) meet all the requirements of law to have his or her  name  on  the
      ballot;
        (b)  be  a  candidate for mayor, public advocate, comptroller, borough
      president or member of the  city  council  in  a  primary,  special,  or
      general  election  and  meet  the threshold for eligibility set forth in
      subdivision two of this section;
        (c) choose to participate in the public  funding  provisions  of  this
      chapter,  by  filing  a  written  certification  in  such form as may be
      prescribed by the campaign finance board, which sets forth  his  or  her
      acceptance  of  an agreement to comply with the terms and conditions for
      the provision of such funds. The deadline for filing such  certification
      for a primary and general election shall be:
        (i) the tenth day of June in the year of the covered election, or such
      other later date as the board shall provide, provided, however, that any
      candidate  who files such written certification prior to such date shall
      be permitted to rescind such certification in writing on or before  such
      date;
        (ii)  the  thirtieth  day  after  a special election is held to fill a
      vacancy for the office sought by the candidate;
      whichever is later. The deadline for filing  such  certification  for  a
      special election to fill a vacancy shall be on the seventh day after the
      proclamation  of  such special election. A certification may be filed on
      or before the seventh day  after  the  occurrence  of  an  extraordinary
      circumstance  in an election, as declared by the campaign finance board,
      following the receipt and review of a petition submitted by a  candidate
      in  such  election.  For  purposes  of this paragraph, an "extraordinary
      circumstance" shall include the death of a candidate  in  the  election,
      the  resignation or removal of the person holding the office sought, and
      the submission to the board of a written declaration by an  officeholder
      that terminates his or her campaign for reelection;
        (d)  obtain  and  furnish to the campaign finance board and his or her
      principal committee or authorized committees must obtain and furnish  to
      the board any information it may request relating to his or her campaign
      expenditures  or  contributions and furnish such documentation and other
      proof of compliance with this chapter as may be requested by such board,
      provided,  however,  that  the  board   shall   accept   such   required
      documentation through an electronically scanned transmission;
        (e)  notify  the board in the candidate's written certification as to:
      (i) the existence  of  each  authorized  committee  authorized  by  such
      candidate  that has not been terminated, (ii) whether any such committee
      also has been authorized by  any  other  candidate,  and  (iii)  if  the
      candidate  has  authorized  more  than  one  authorized committee, which
      authorized committee  has  been  designated  by  the  candidate  as  the
      candidate's  principal  committee  for  the  election(s)  covered by the
      candidate's certification; provided, that such principal  committee  (i)
      shall  be  the  only  committee  authorized  by such candidate to aid or
      otherwise take part  in  the  election(s)  covered  by  the  candidate's
      certification,  (ii)  shall  not be an authorized committee of any other
      candidate, and (iii) shall not have been authorized or otherwise  active
      for  any  election  prior  to the election(s) covered by the candidate's
      certification. The use of an entity other than the designated  principal
      committee  to  aid  or otherwise take part in the election(s) covered by
      the candidate's certification shall be a violation of this  section  and
      shall  trigger  the application to such entity of all provisions of this
      chapter governing principal committees;
    
        (f) not accept and  his  or  her  principal  committee  or  authorized
      committees  must  not  accept,  either  directly  or  by  transfer,  any
      contribution or contributions  from  any  one  individual,  partnership,
      political  committee, labor organization or other entity for all covered
      elections  held  in  the  same  calendar  year  in  which he or she is a
      participating candidate or a non-participating candidate  which  in  the
      aggregate:  (i)  for the office of mayor, public advocate or comptroller
      shall exceed four thousand five hundred dollars,  or  (ii)  for  borough
      president,  shall  exceed  three thousand five hundred dollars, or (iii)
      for member of the city council, shall exceed two thousand  five  hundred
      dollars;  provided  that  a  participating  candidate  and  his  or  her
      principal committee or a non-participating  candidate  and  his  or  her
      authorized  committees  may accept additional contributions which do not
      exceed one half the amount of the applicable limitation for any  run-off
      primary   election,   additional   day   for  voting  held  pursuant  to
      section 3-108 of the New York state election law,  special  election  to
      fill  a  vacancy, run-off special election to fill a vacancy, delayed or
      otherwise postponed election, or election held pursuant to  court  order
      which  is a covered election and in which the candidate seeks nomination
      for election or election; and provided further that for the purposes  of
      this  paragraph,  contributions  made  by  different labor organizations
      shall not be aggregated  or  treated  as  contributions  from  a  single
      contributor  for purposes of the contribution limit that is set forth in
      this paragraph if those  labor  organizations  make  contributions  from
      different   accounts,   maintain   separate   accounts   with  different
      signatories, do not share a  majority  of  members  of  their  governing
      boards,  and  do not share a majority of the officers of their governing
      boards; and provided further that if state law prescribes a contribution
      limitation of a lesser amount, this paragraph shall  not  be  deemed  to
      authorize  acceptance of a contribution in excess of such lesser amount.
      The maximum contributions set forth in this paragraph shall be  adjusted
      in accordance with subdivision seven of this section;
        (g)  maintain  and  his  or  her  principal  committee  or  authorized
      committees must maintain such records of receipts and expenditures for a
      covered election as required by the board;
        (h) not make expenditures from or use his or  her  personal  funds  or
      property  or the personal funds or property jointly held with his or her
      spouse, domestic partner, or unemancipated children in  connection  with
      his  or her nomination for election or election except as a contribution
      to his or her principal committee in an  amount  that  does  not  exceed
      three  times  the  maximum  contribution  amount  applicable pursuant to
      paragraph (f)  of  this  subdivision.  Such  candidate  shall  not  make
      expenditures  from or use other personal funds or property of his or her
      spouse, domestic partner or unemancipated children  in  connection  with
      his  or  her  nomination  for  election  or election; provided that this
      paragraph shall not be construed to limit contributions by persons other
      than the candidate;
        (i) not make  and  his  or  her  principal  committee  must  not  make
      expenditures  which  in  the aggregate exceed the applicable expenditure
      limitations set forth in section 3-706;
        (j) meet the threshold for eligibility set forth in subdivision two of
      this section;
        (k) not accept and his or her principal  committee  must  not  accept,
      either  directly  or  by transfer, any contribution, loan, guarantee, or
      other security for such  loan  from  any  political  committee  for  all
      covered elections held in the same calendar year in which he or she is a
      participating   candidate,   except   as   is   otherwise  provided  for
    
      contributions by political committees pursuant to section 3-707 of  this
      chapter; and
        (l)  not  accept  and  his  or  her  principal committee or authorized
      committees  must  not  accept,  either  directly  or  by  transfer,  any
      contribution,  loan, guarantee, or other security for such loan from any
      corporation, limited liability company, limited liability partnership or
      partnership,  other  than  a  corporation,  limited  liability  company,
      limited  liability  partnership  or  partnership  that  is  a  political
      committee as defined in subdivision eleven  of  section  3-702  of  this
      chapter,  for  all  covered  elections held in the same calendar year in
      which he or she  is  a  participating  or  non-participating  candidate,
      provided, however, that where a contribution is from a contributor whose
      name is followed by a professional designation including but not limited
      to   "M.D.",  "Esq."  and  "C.P.A."  the  board  shall  not  treat  such
      contribution as coming from a corporation,  limited  liability  company,
      limited  liability  partnership or partnership in the absence of further
      indicia that such contribution is from such an entity;
        (m) fulfill the requirements of section 12-110 of  the  administrative
      code  of  the  city  of  New York, including payment of any penalties as
      determined by the conflicts of interest board.
        (i) The conflicts of interest  board  shall  provide  a  participating
      candidate  with  a  receipt  indicating proof of compliance with section
      12-110 of the administrative code of the city of New York in  such  form
      as  the  conflicts  of  interest  board shall determine. Such receipt as
      provided by the conflicts of interest board shall indicate the time  and
      date of filing of the financial disclosure report.
        (ii)  A  participating  candidate  shall  provide the campaign finance
      board with the receipt provided  by  the  conflicts  of  interest  board
      pursuant  to subparagraph (i) of this paragraph, in such form and manner
      as the campaign finance board shall require, by the last business day of
      July in the year of the covered election, or such other  later  date  as
      the  campaign  finance  board  shall  provide  by rule, except that in a
      special election to fill a vacancy the deadline for filing such  receipt
      shall be established by campaign finance board rule.
        (iii)   A   participating   candidate  who  fails  to  adhere  to  the
      requirements of subparagraph  (ii)  of  this  paragraph  may  thereafter
      satisfy  the  requirements  of this paragraph by submitting a receipt in
      accordance with subparagraph (i) of this paragraph at such times and  in
      such  manner  as  provided  by campaign finance board rule. The campaign
      finance board shall thereafter allow the participating candidate to make
      a claim for public  funds  upon  satisfying  the  requirements  of  this
      paragraph and all other applicable law, rules and regulations; provided,
      however that a receipt that is not filed timely pursuant to subparagraph
      (ii)  of  this  paragraph may result in a delay of any payment of public
      funds by the board; and
        (n) satisfy any claim made by the  board  for  the  payment  of  civil
      penalties  or repayment of public funds that remains outstanding against
      such candidate or his  or  her  principal  committee  or  an  authorized
      committee  of  such  candidate from a prior covered election, if (i) the
      candidate had written notice of such potential claim  and  ineligibility
      to  receive public funds prior to filing a written certification for the
      current covered election pursuant to paragraph (c) of this  subdivision,
      or  (ii)  in  the event no such timely notice has been given pursuant to
      subparagraph (i), the candidate has been given an opportunity to present
      to the board reasons he or she should  be  eligible  to  receive  public
      funds.
        (o)  agree that expenditures by his or her principal committee for the
      purpose of advocating a vote for or against a proposal on the ballot  in
    
      an  election  that  is  also  a covered election shall be subject to the
      contribution and expenditure  limitations  applicable  in  such  covered
      election.
        1-a.  Notwithstanding  any  inconsistent  provision of this section, a
      participating candidate or  his  or  her  principal  committee  may  not
      accept,   either   directly   or   by   transfer,  any  contribution  or
      contributions  for  a  covered  election  in  which  he  or  she  is   a
      participating  candidate from a natural person who has business dealings
      with the city, as that  term  is  defined  in  subdivision  eighteen  of
      section 3-702 of this chapter, if the aggregate of such contributions to

      comptroller  four  hundred  dollars;  (ii)  for  borough president three
      hundred twenty dollars; and (iii) for member of  the  city  council  two
      hundred fifty dollars; provided that a participating candidate or his or
      her principal committee may accept additional contributions which do not
      exceed  one half the amount of the applicable limitation for any run-off
      primary election, additional day for voting  held  pursuant  to  section
      3-108  of  the  New  York state election law, special election to fill a
      vacancy,  run-off  special  election  to  fill  a  vacancy,  delayed  or
      otherwise  postponed  election, or election held pursuant to court order
      which is a covered election and in which the candidate seeks  nomination
      for election or election. Any contribution made pursuant to this section
      shall not be a matchable contribution. For purposes of this subdivision,

      this subdivision, the phrase "senior managerial capacity" shall  mean  a
      high level supervisory capacity, either by virtue of title or duties, in
      which  substantial  discretion  and  oversight  is  exercised  over  the
      solicitation, letting or administration of  business  transactions  with
      the city, including contracts, franchises, concessions, grants, economic
      development   agreements   and  applications  for  land  use  approvals.
      Notwithstanding any provision of this subdivision,  the  limitations  on
      contributions  contained herein shall not apply to any contribution made
      by a natural person who  has  business  dealings  with  the  city  to  a
      participating  candidate  or  his  or her principal committee where such
      participating candidate is the contributor, or where such  participating
      candidate   is  the  contributor's  parent,  spouse,  domestic  partner,
      sibling, child, grandchild, aunt, uncle,  cousin,  niece  or  nephew  by
      blood or by marriage.
        1-b.  Individuals  and organizations having business dealings with the
      city of New York.  a.  Each  participating  candidate  and  his  or  her
      principal  committee shall inquire of every individual or entity making,
      a contribution, loan, guarantee or  other  security  for  such  loan  in
      excess  of  the  amounts  set forth in subdivision 1-a of section 3-703,
      through a question, in a form prescribed by the campaign finance  board,
      as  to  whether  such  individual,  corporation,  partnership, political
      committee, employee organization or other entity has  business  dealings
      with  the city, as that term is defined in this chapter, and, if so, the
      name of the agency or entity with which such business  dealings  are  or
      were  carried  on  and the appropriate type or category of such business
      dealings. Such form  shall  contain  in  prominent  typeface  and  in  a
      prominent location the statement "If a contributor has business dealings
      with  the  City as defined in the campaign finance act, such contributor
      may contribute only up to two hundred fifty dollars  for  city  council,
    
      three  hundred  twenty  dollars  for  borough president and four hundred
      dollars for mayor, comptroller or public advocate." Upon receipt of  the
      response  to  such  inquiry  (including  any  failure  to  respond), the
      principal  committee  shall  keep a copy in its records and shall report
      each contribution to the board on the next applicable filing deadline in
      accordance with the board's disclosure schedule. The board  shall  check
      each  contribution  against the doing business database and shall notify
      the principal committee within twenty days  of  the  reporting  of  such
      contribution if a contribution exceeding the doing business contribution
      limitation  set  forth in subdivision 1-a of section 3-703 is subject to
      such limitations  of  this  subchapter  or  if  a  contribution  is  not
      matchable pursuant to such subdivision. Notwithstanding any provision in
      this  subdivision,  in  the six weeks preceding the covered election the
      board shall provide such notification to  the  principal  or  authorized
      committee   within   three  business  days  of  the  reporting  of  such
      contribution to  the  board  in  accordance  with  applicable  reporting
      deadlines.  If  the board fails to notify the principal committee that a
      contribution is in excess of the limitations set  forth  in  subdivision
      1-a   of   section  3-703  of  this  chapter  in  accordance  with  this
      subdivision, any such contribution shall be deemed valid for purposes of
      such limitation, provided, however, that no such contribution  shall  be
      matchable. Such principal committee shall have twenty days from the date
      of  any  such  notification  to return the amount of any contribution in
      excess of the limitations set forth in subdivision 1-a of section  3-703
      to  the  contributor.  No  violation shall issue and no penalty shall be
      imposed where such excess  amount  is  postmarked  or  delivered  within
      twenty  days  of  such notification by the board and the board shall not
      designate a candidate as having accepted a  contribution  in  excess  of
      such  limitations where such excess has been returned in accordance with
      the time limitations set forth herein. Failure  to  return  such  excess
      amount  in accordance with the provisions herein shall not result in the
      board withholding public funds for which the  participating  candidate's
      principal  committee  is otherwise eligible pursuant to section 3-705 of
      this chapter; provided, however, that the board  may  deduct  an  amount
      equal to the total unreturned contributions in excess of the limitations
      set  forth in subdivision 1-a of section 3-703 of this chapter from such
      payment of public funds. For  purposes  of  this  section,  "individual"
      shall  include  any  chief  executive  officer, chief financial officer,
      and/or chief operating officer of an entity or  persons  serving  in  an
      equivalent   capacity,  any  person  in  a  senior  managerial  capacity
      regarding an entity, or any person with an interest in an entity,  which
      exceeds ten percent of the entity. For purposes of this subdivision, the
      phrase  "senior managerial capacity" shall mean a high level supervisory
      capacity, either by virtue of title  or  duties,  in  which  substantial
      discretion  and oversight is exercised over the solicitation, letting or
      administration  of  business  transactions  with  the  city,   including
      contracts,   franchises,   concessions,   grants,  economic  development
      agreements, and applications for land use approvals. Notwithstanding any
      other provision of this section, no  participating  candidate  shall  be
      liable  for  any  fine  or penalty for the failure of any contributor to
      respond to any such request or for any erroneous response.
        * 1-c. Notwithstanding any inconsistent provision of this  section,  a
      participating  and  non-participating candidate and his or her principal
      or authorized committee may accept text message contributions; provided,
      however, that such contributions may not exceed ninety nine dollars  per
      contributor per candidate for all covered elections in the same calendar
      year,  and  further provided that the contributor shall certify via text
      message that he or she will personally pay the amount specified  to  the
    
      wireless  service  provider, and shall provide such other certifications
      as the board  shall  require.  A  text  message  contribution  shall  be
      attributed  to the individual who is the registered user of the specific
      mobile  device  from  which  the  contribution  was  initiated; shall be
      reported in accordance with the requirements of subdivision six of  this
      section;  and  shall be a matchable contribution pursuant to subdivision
      three  of  section  3-702,  provided   such   contribution   meets   the
      requirements  of  that subdivision, of this section, and of the rules of
      the board.

        (b)  Any participating candidate meeting the threshold for eligibility
      in a primary election for one of the foregoing offices shall  be  deemed
      to  have  met the threshold for eligibility for such office in any other
      election, other than a special election to fill a vacancy, held  in  the
      same calendar year.
        3.  In  order  to  be  eligible  to  receive public funds in a primary
      election a participating candidate must agree that in the  event  he  or
      she  is  a  candidate  for such office in any other election held in the
      same calendar year, other than a special election  to  fill  a  vacancy,
      that  he  or  she  will  be  bound  in  each  such other election by the
      eligibility requirements and all other provisions of this chapter.
        4. Candidates who are contested in a primary election  for  nomination
      for  election  to  office  and  who  do not file a written certification
      pursuant to paragraph (c) of subdivision one of this section  shall  not
      be eligible for public funds for any election to such office held in the
      same calendar year other than a special election to fill a vacancy.
        5.  Participating  candidates  who  are seeking nomination or election
      exclusively as write-in candidates,  who  are  unopposed  in  a  covered
      election,  or  who  are opposed in a covered election only by candidates
      seeking nomination or election exclusively as write-in candidates, shall
      not be eligible to receive public funds for such election.
        6. (a) Each participating or limited participating candidate  and  his
      or her principal committee, and each non-participating candidate and his
      or   her   authorized   committees  shall  report  to  the  board  every
      contribution, loan, guarantee, or other security for such loan  received
    
      by the candidate and such committee, the full name, residential address,
      occupation,  employer, and business address of each contributor, lender,
      guarantor, or provider of security and of each person or entity which is
      the  intermediary  for  such  contribution,  loan,  guarantee,  or other
      security for such loan, and every expenditure made by the candidate  and
      such  committee,  including  expenditures  not subject to section 3-706.
      Disclosure reports shall be submitted at such times and in such form  as
      the board shall require and shall be clearly legible.
        (b) Notwithstanding paragraph (a) above:
        (i)  an  intermediary  need  not be reported for any contribution to a
      participating  or  limited  participating  candidate  and  his  or   her
      principal  committee  or  a  non-participating  candidate and his or her
      authorized  committees  that  was  collected  from  a   contributor   in
      connection  with  a  party  or other candidate-related event held at the
      residence of the person delivering the contribution, unless the expenses
      of such events at such residence for such candidate exceed five  hundred
      dollars  for  a covered election or the aggregate contributions received
      from that contributor at such events exceed five hundred dollars;
        (ii) contributions aggregating not more than ninety-nine dollars  from
      any  one contributor for all covered elections held in a single calendar
      year or for a special  election  need  not  be  separately  itemized  in
      disclosure  reports submitted to the board on behalf of a participating,
      or limited participating or non-participating candidate and his  or  her
      principal  committee  or  authorized committees, provided, however, that
      contributions which are not itemized shall not be matchable;
        (iii) the treasurer of the principal committee  need  not  collect  or
      disclose   the   occupation,  employer,  and  business  address  of  any
      contributor making contributions aggregating not more  than  ninety-nine
      dollars  for all covered elections held in a single calendar year or for
      a special election; provided, however, such  occupation,  employer,  and
      business  address  shall be disclosed if such contributors are employees
      of a participating or limited participating candidate or the  spouse  or
      domestic partner of such candidate or an entity in which such candidate,
      spouse  or  domestic partner has an ownership interest of ten percent or
      more or a management position, including, but not limited to,  being  an
      officer, director or trustee; and
        (iv) disclosure reports, other than reports required to be filed every
      six  months  in  accordance  with the schedule specified by the New York
      state board  of  elections,  need  not  be  submitted  on  behalf  of  a
      participating   or  limited  participating  candidate  and  his  or  her
      principal committee or a non-participating  candidate  and  his  or  her
      authorized  committees  if  the  cumulative  amount of contributions and
      loans accepted by such candidate  and  committee  following  the  period
      covered  in the last disclosure report submitted to the campaign finance
      board on behalf of such candidate is less than two thousand  dollars  or
      such  higher  amount as may be determined by the campaign finance board,
      provided, however, that disclosure reports shall be submitted on  behalf
      of  a  participating  or  limited participating candidate and his or her
      principal committee or a non-participating  candidate  and  his  or  her
      authorized  committees  if  that candidate and his or her committee have
      made expenditures in excess of forty-five  percent  of  the  expenditure
      limitation   applicable   to  participating  and  limited  participating
      candidates under section 3-706. The campaign finance  board  shall  make
      available to the public a copy of disclosure reports within two business
      days after they are accepted by the board.
        6-a.  Any  rules  promulgated  by the board to require that disclosure
      reports submitted pursuant to this chapter be submitted in an electronic
      format shall provide exemptions for small campaigns, as defined by board
    
      rules, and for other campaigns that demonstrate that  submission  in  an
      electronic format would pose a substantial hardship.
        7.  Not  later  than  the  first day of March in the year two thousand
      eighteen and every fourth year thereafter  the  campaign  finance  board
      shall (i) determine the percentage difference between the average over a
      calendar  year  of  the  consumer  price  index for the metropolitan New
      York-New Jersey region published by the United States  bureau  of  labor
      statistics  for  the  twelve  months  preceding  the  beginning  of such
      calendar year and the  average  over  the  calendar  year  two  thousand
      fifteen   of  such  consumer  price  index;  (ii)  adjust  each  maximum
      contribution applicable pursuant to paragraph (f) of subdivision one  of
      this  section by the amount of such percentage difference to the nearest
      fifty dollars; and (iii) publish such adjusted maximum  contribution  in
      the  City  Record. Such adjusted maximum contribution shall be in effect
      for any election held before the next such adjustment.
        8. If a participating or limited participating candidate  and  his  or
      her  principal committee or a non-participating candidate and his or her
      authorized  committees  demonstrate  to  the  board  that  a   political
      committee  has  not  accepted contributions, loans, or other receipts or
      made expenditures or transfers in a covered election, and represent that
      such committee will not accept contributions, loans, or  other  receipts
      or   make   expenditures   or  transfers  in  a  covered  election,  the
      participating  or  limited  participating  candidate  and  his  or   her
      principal  committee  or  non-participating  candidate  and  his  or her
      authorized  committees  may  submit  to  the  board  legible  copies  of
      financial  disclosure  reports,  required  to  be filed with the city or
      state board of elections, for such committees in lieu of the  disclosure
      report  form  designated by the board for purposes of subdivision six of
      this section.
        9. No political committee authorized by a  participating,  or  limited
      participating  or non-participating candidate for a covered election may
      be authorized to aid or take part in the  elections  of  more  than  one
      candidate.
        10.  All receipts accepted by a participating or limited participating
      candidate and his or her principal committee shall be  deposited  in  an
      account   of  the  principal  committee.  All  receipts  accepted  by  a
      non-participating candidate and his or her authorized  committees  shall
      be  deposited  in an account of the authorized committees. The treasurer
      of the principal committee or authorized committee shall be  responsible
      for making such deposits. All deposits shall be made within ten business
      days  of receipt; provided, however, that deposits of contributions made
      in  the  form  of  checks  received  by  a  participating,  or   limited
      participating  or  non-participating candidate and his or her committees
      for the office of city council more  than  one  year  before  the  first
      covered  election  for  which  such  candidate  is seeking nomination or
      election may be made  within  twenty  business  days  of  receipt.  Each
      disclosure  report  filed  pursuant  to  subdivision six of this section
      shall include the date of receipt of each contribution accepted.
        11.  Regardless  whether  a   participating   candidate   demonstrates
      eligibility   for  optional  public  financing  under  this  chapter,  a
      participating  candidate  and  his  or  her  principal   committee   are
      nonetheless  required  to  abide  by the requirements of paragraphs (d),
      (e), (f), (g), (h), (i), (k) and (l) of subdivision one of this section.
        12.  (a)  Each  participating  candidate  or   limited   participating
      candidate  for  nomination  for  election, or election, or the principal
      committee of such candidate, shall submit, in a contemporaneous  manner,
      the  disclosure  reports  required  pursuant  to  this chapter, filed in
      accordance with the schedule specified by the state board  of  elections
    
      for  the filing of campaign receipt and expenditure statements, and such
      other disclosure reports as the rules of the board may require, in order
      for any contributions  received  during  the  periods  covered  by  such
      reports  and prior to the last date upon which such candidate may file a
      certification pursuant to paragraph  (c)  of  subdivision  one  of  this
      section to qualify as matchable contributions.
        (b)  The board shall review each disclosure report timely submitted by
      a candidate prior to the last date upon which such candidate may file  a
      certification  pursuant  to  paragraph  (c)  of  subdivision one of this
      section, or subdivision one of section 3-718, and issue to the candidate
      a review before the next disclosure report is  due.  Such  review  shall
      inform  the candidate of relevant questions the board has concerning the
      candidate's: (i) compliance with requirements of this chapter and of the
      rules issued by the board; and (ii) qualification for  receiving  public
      funds  pursuant to this chapter. In the course of this review, the board
      shall give candidates an opportunity to respond to and correct potential
      violations, before the deadline for filing a certification  pursuant  to
      paragraph  (c) of subdivision one of this section, or subdivision one of
      section 3-718, and give candidates an opportunity to  address  questions
      the  board  has  concerning their matchable contribution claims or other
      issues concerning eligibility for receiving  public  funds  pursuant  to
      this  chapter;  provided, however, this paragraph shall not apply to the
      last required  disclosure  report  before  the  deadline  for  filing  a
      certification  pursuant  to  paragraph  (c)  of  subdivision one of this
      section or subdivision one of section 3-718. Nothing in  this  paragraph
      shall  preclude  the  board  from subsequently reviewing such disclosure
      reports and taking any action otherwise authorized under this chapter.
        13. Candidates who file a certification pursuant to subdivision one of
      this section shall not be eligible to file a certification  pursuant  to
      section  3-718,  and  candidates  who  file  a certification pursuant to
      section 3-718 shall not be eligible to file a certification pursuant  to
      subdivision one of this section.
        14. (a) Transfers that a principal committee receives from a political
      committee (other than another principal committee) at any time during an
      election cycle shall:
        (i)  be  attributed  to  previous contributions in accordance with the
      duly promulgated rules of the campaign finance board applicable to  such
      transfer or use;
        (ii) exclude an amount equal to the total of:
        (A) such previous contributions, or portions thereof, that violate the
      limitations,  restrictions,  or  prohibitions  of  the  charter and this
      chapter applicable in the  covered  election  for  which  the  principal
      committee is designated; and
        (B)  such  previous  contributions, or portions thereof, for which the
      principal committee has not obtained and submitted to the  board,  prior
      to  receipt  of  the  transfer,  evidence of the contributor's intent to
      designate the contribution for such  covered  election,  and  any  other
      record, as determined by the rules of the board; and
        (iii) not be matchable.
        (b)  Each  transfer,  the  contributions  to  which  the  transfer  is
      attributed,  and  all  expenditures  made  in   connection   with   such
      contributions  shall  be  reported  to  the board in the next disclosure
      report due  pursuant  to  this  section  3-703  after  the  transfer  is
      received.   These   expenditures   shall,  at  a  minimum,  include  all
      expenditures made by the political committee making the transfer  during
      the  election  cycle  of  the  covered  election.  The board shall issue
      instructions defining the circumstances in which such disclosure reports
      shall also include  additional  expenditures  made  by  other  political
    
      committees  authorized  by  the  participating candidate that originally
      received such contributions and additional expenditures  made  prior  to
      such   election  cycle.  Such  expenditures  shall  be  applied  to  the
      expenditure limit applicable under 3-706.
        (c)  Participating  candidates  shall have the burden of demonstrating
      that expenditures reported pursuant to paragraph (b) of this subdivision
      are not subject to the expenditure limit applicable under section  3-706
      and  are  not  a  basis  for  reducing public funds payments pursuant to
      subdivision eight of section 3-705 of this chapter.
        (d) Nothing in this subdivision is intended to modify or supersede any
      federal law that prohibits or otherwise restricts the use of campaign or
      donated  funds  by   political   committees,   candidates   or   federal
      officeholders.
        15.  Participating  candidates, their campaign managers, treasurers or
      persons with significant managerial control over  a  campaign  shall  be
      required  to  attend  a  training provided by the campaign finance board
      concerning compliance with the  requirements  of  the  campaign  finance
      program and use of the campaign finance program software.

      under the provisions of this chapter may be used only  for  expenditures
      by  a  principal  committee  to  further  the  participating candidate's
      nomination for election or election, either in  a  special  election  to
      fill  a  vacancy,  or  during  the calendar year in which the primary or

Section 3-705 ::    
        
     
        ยง  3-705  Optional  public financing. Each participating candidate for
      nomination for election or election in a  covered  election  may  obtain
      payment  to  his  or  her  principal  committee  from  public  funds for
      qualified campaign expenditures, in accordance with  the  provisions  of
      this chapter, and subject to appropriation.
        1.  No such public funds shall be paid to a principal committee unless
      the board determines  that  the  participating  candidate  has  met  the
      eligibility  requirements  of this chapter. Payment shall not exceed the
      amounts specified in this chapter, and shall be made only in  accordance
      with  the  provisions  of this chapter. Such payment may be made only to
      the participating candidate's principal committee. No public funds shall
      be used except  as  reimbursement  or  payment  for  qualified  campaign
      expenditures  actually  and  lawfully incurred or to repay loans used to
      pay qualified campaign expenditures.
        2. (a) If the threshold for  eligibility  is  met,  the  participating
      candidate's  principal  committee  shall  receive  payment for qualified
      campaign expenditures of six dollars for each one  dollar  of  matchable
      contributions,  up  to  one  thousand  fifty dollars in public funds per
      contributor (or up to five hundred twenty-two dollars  in  public  funds
      per  contributor  in  the  case  of  a  special  election), obtained and
      reported to the campaign finance board in accordance with the provisions
      of this chapter.
        (b) Except as otherwise  provided  in  subdivision  three  of  section
      3-706,  in  no  case  shall  the  principal committee of a participating
      candidate receive public funds pursuant to paragraph (a) above in excess
      of an amount equal to fifty-five percent of the  expenditure  limitation
      provided  in  subdivision  one of section 3-706 for the office for which
      such candidate seeks nomination for election or election.
        (c) No funds shall be  provided  pursuant  to  this  subdivision  with
      respect  to  any  covered election specified in subdivision five of this
      section.
        3. A participating  candidate  seeking  or  obtaining  nomination  for
      election by more than one party shall be deemed one candidate, and shall
      not   receive  additional  public  funds  or  be  authorized  to  accept
      contributions in excess of the maximum contribution applicable  pursuant
      to  paragraph (f) of subdivision one of section 3-703 or make additional
      expenditures by reason of such candidate seeking or obtaining nomination
      for election by more than one party. Subdivision five of  section  3-703
      shall  not  be  applicable  to  such  a candidate who is opposed for the
      nomination of at least one party in a primary election. The  elimination
      of the expenditure limitations and qualification for additional matching
      funds  provided  in  subdivision  three  of  section  3-706 shall not be
      applicable to such a candidate who is opposed for the nomination  of  at
      least one party solely by participating candidates.
        4.  The campaign finance board shall make possible payment within four
      business days after receipt of reports of matchable contributions, or as
      soon thereafter as is practicable, but not  earlier  than  the  earliest
      dates  for making such payments as provided in subdivisions five and six
      of section 3-709; provided, however, that the board shall withhold up to
      five percent of all public funds payments  to  participating  candidates
      until  the  final pre-election payment for any given election. The board
      shall schedule a minimum of three payment dates within the  thirty  days
      prior  to  a  covered  election. For purposes of such payment dates, the
      board  shall  provide  each  candidate  with  a  written   determination
      specifying  the  basis  for  any  non-payment.  The  board shall provide
      candidates with a process by which they may immediately upon receipt  of
      such  determination  petition  the board for reconsideration of any such
      non-payment and such reconsideration shall occur  within  five  business
    
      days  of the filing of such petition. In the event that the board denies
      such petition then it shall immediately notify the candidate of  his  or
      her  right  to  bring a special proceeding pursuant to article 78 of the
      civil practice law and rules.
        5.  (a)  Notwithstanding  any  other  provision  of  this  chapter,  a
      participating candidate in a run-off primary election held  pursuant  to
      section  6-162  of  the New York state election law or a run-off special
      election to fill a vacancy shall obtain  prompt  payment  for  qualified
      campaign  expenditures  in an amount equal to twenty-five cents for each
      one dollar of  public  funds  paid  pursuant  to  this  chapter  to  the
      candidate's principal committee for the preceding election.
        (b)  The  board  shall  promulgate  rules  to  provide  for the prompt
      issuance of additional public funds to eligible participating candidates
      for qualified campaign expenditures in the case of an additional day for
      voting held pursuant to section 3-108 of the  New  York  state  election
      law, an election held pursuant to court order, or a delayed or otherwise
      postponed election.
        (c)  Except  as  provided  for  by  this  subdivision  and  any  rules
      promulgated hereby, no public funds shall be provided to  any  candidate
      for  any  run-off  primary  election, run-off special election to fill a
      vacancy, additional day for voting,  election  held  pursuant  to  court
      order, or delayed or otherwise postponed election.
        6.  Notwithstanding  any  other  provision  of  this  chapter  to  the
      contrary, to protect  the  public  fund  from  disproportionately  large
      payments  when  the  number  of  voters  eligible  to  vote in a primary
      election is small, the board shall adopt rules setting a reduced maximum
      primary election public funds payment for  participating  candidates  on
      the  ballot  in  one  or  more  primary elections in which the number of
      persons eligible to vote for party nominees total fewer than such number
      as shall be specified by the board in such rules, if any. Any such rules
      shall not  apply  to  participating  candidates  opposed  in  a  primary
      election  by one or more participating candidates who are not subject to
      such reduced maximum primary election  public  funds  payment  or  by  a
      non-participating  candidate  who  makes  expenditures  in  excess  of a
      specified amount for such primary election, as determined by the board.
        7. Notwithstanding any provision of this section to the contrary,  the
      amount  of  public funds payable a participating candidate on the ballot
      in any covered election shall not exceed  one  quarter  of  the  maximum
      public  funds payment otherwise applicable under subdivision two of this
      section, unless:
        (a) the participating candidate is opposed  by  a  candidate  and  the
      board has determined that such other candidate and his or her authorized
      committees  have  spent  or  contracted  or  have obligated to spend, or
      received in loans or contributions, or both, an  amount  which,  in  the
      aggregate,  exceeds  one-fifth  of  the applicable expenditure limit for
      such office fixed by subdivision one of section 3-706  of  this  chapter
      for participating candidates; or
        (b)  the  participating  candidate  has  submitted  a certified signed
      statement attesting to the need and stating the  reason  for  additional
      public  funds  in  such  election, in which case the board shall publish
      such statement at the  time  such  additional  public  funds  are  paid,
      including  on  the board's internet website. Such statement must certify
      that (i) one or more of the following conditions  apply  and  (ii)  such
      condition  or conditions reasonably demonstrate the need for such public
      funds,  and  the  participating  candidate  must  provide  documentation
      demonstrating the existence of such condition or conditions:
        (1)  the participating candidate is opposed by (i) a non-participating
      candidate or (ii) a limited  participating  candidate,  and  provides  a
    
      factual  basis with supporting documentation of such candidate's ability
      to self finance;
        (2)  the  participating  candidate  is  opposed by a candidate who has
      received (i) the endorsement of a citywide or statewide elected official
      or a federal elected official representing all or a portion of the  area
      covered  by  the election; (ii) two or more endorsements from other city
      elected officials who represent all or a part of the area covered by the
      election; or (iii) endorsements of one or more membership  organizations
      with a membership of over 250 members;
        (3)  the participating candidate is opposed by a candidate who has had
      significant media exposure in the twelve months preceding the  election.
      For  purposes  of  this paragraph, significant media exposure shall mean
      appearance of the opponent or his or her name on television or radio  in
      the  area  of  the  covered  election  or  in  print  media  in  general
      circulation in the area of the covered election at least twelve times in
      the year preceding the covered election;  provided,  however,  that  the
      listing  of  names  of  candidates or potential candidates for a covered
      election without additional information concerning  the  opponent  shall
      not constitute an appearance for purposes of this paragraph;
        (4)  the  participating  candidate  is  opposed by a candidate who has
      received twenty-five percent or more of the  vote  in  an  election  for
      public  office  in  an area encompassing all or part of the area that is
      the subject of the current election in the last  eight  years  preceding
      the election;
        (5)  the  participating candidate is opposed by a candidate whose name
      is substantially similar to the candidate's so as to result in confusion
      among voters, as determined by the board;
        (6) the participating candidate in a city council or borough-wide race
      is opposed by a candidate who is a chairman or president of a  community
      board or district manager of a community board; or
        (7)  the  participating  candidate  is  opposed  by  a candidate whose
      spouse, domestic partner, sibling, parent or child  holds  or  has  held
      elective  office  in an area encompassing all or part of the area of the
      covered election in the past ten years.
        The board shall be  authorized  to  verify  the  truthfulness  of  any
      certified  statement  submitted  pursuant  to  this paragraph and of any
      supporting documentation and shall post such  certified  statements  and
      supporting documentation on its website.
        (c)  the  participating  candidate  is opposed in a primary or special
      election for an office for which no incumbent is seeking re-election.
        If any of the conditions described in  paragraphs  (a),  (b),  or  (c)
      occur  in  such  election,  the  board  shall pay any and all additional
      public funds due to the participating candidate up to the maximum  total
      payment  applicable  in  such  election under subdivisions two or six of
      this section or subdivision three of section 3-706 of this chapter.
        8. Contributions by a principal committee of a participating candidate
      to other political committees shall not be a basis for  reducing  public
      funds payments, provided that: (a) such principal committee has received
      contributions   (other   than  matchable  contributions)  that,  in  the
      aggregate, exceed the total of such  contributions  to  other  political
      committees and (b) such contributions in the aggregate do not exceed:
        (i)  three  thousand  dollars,  if  such  principal  committee  is the
      principal committee of a participating candidate seeking nomination  for
      election or election to the office of member of the city council;
        (ii)  five  thousand  dollars,  if  such  principal  committee  is the
      principal committee of a participating candidate seeking nomination  for
      election or election to the office of borough president; and
    
        (iii)  ten  thousand  dollars,  if  such  principal  committee  is the
      principal committee of a participating candidate seeking nomination  for
      election or election to a city-wide office.
        9.  If  a participating candidate endorses or publicly supports his or
      her opponent for election, such candidate  shall  not  be  eligible  for
      public funds.
        10.  A  participating  candidate who loses in the primary election but
      remains on the ballot for the general election must certify to the board
      before receiving public funds that he or she will actively campaign  for
      office;  such  campaign  activity  shall include, but not be limited to,
      raising and spending funds, seeking endorsements, and broadly soliciting
      votes.

      principal committee shall not be ineligible to  receive  public  funding
      for  qualified  campaign expenditures or be in violation of this chapter

        3. (a) If any candidate in any covered election chooses not to file  a
      certification  as  a  participating  or  limited participating candidate
      pursuant to this chapter, and  where  the  campaign  finance  board  has

        (iii) for elections occurring after January first, two thousand eight,
      the campaign finance board shall promulgate rules to  provide  that  the
      principal  committees  of  such  participating  candidates shall receive

      highest  allowable  matchable contribution to be matched by an amount up
      to  one  thousand  two  hundred  fifty  dollars  in  public  funds   per
      contributor  (or  up  to six hundred twenty five dollars in public funds
      per contributor in the case of  special  election);  provided,  however,
      that  (A)  participating  candidates in a run-off election shall receive
      public funds for such election pursuant to subdivision five  of  section
      3-705 and shall not receive any additional public funds pursuant to this
      section,  and  (B)  in  no  case  shall a principal committee receive in
      public  funds  an  amount  exceeding  two-thirds  of   the   expenditure
      limitation provided for such office in subdivision one of this section.
        (b)  If  any  candidate  in any covered election chooses not to file a
      certification as a  participating  or  limited  participating  candidate
      pursuant  to  this  chapter,  and  where  the campaign finance board has
      determined that such candidate and his or her authorized committees have
      spent or contracted or have obligated to spend, or received in loans  or
      contributions, or both, an amount which, in the aggregate, exceeds three
      times  the  applicable  expenditure  limit  for  such  office  fixed  by
      subdivision one of this section, then:
        (i) such expenditure limit shall  no  longer  apply  to  participating
      candidates  and  limited  participating  candidates in such election for
      such office; and
        (ii) the principal committees of such participating  candidates  shall
      receive  payment  for qualified campaign expenditures of six dollars for

      opportunity  for  candidates  to test their electronic filings on any of

      established  for the regulation of inauguration and transition donations
      and expenditures including the promulgation of rules and regulations and
      the imposition of any penalties related thereto, as  required  by  local
      law. The specific powers enumerated in subdivisions 5, 6, 7, 8, 9 and 11

      established a special fund, to be known as the New  York  city  campaign
      finance  fund.  The  moneys in such fund may be expended by the campaign
      finance  board  only  as  payments  for  participating   candidates   in
      accordance with the provisions of this chapter.
        2. The fund shall be kept separate and shall be credited with all sums
      appropriated  therefor,  any  donations received pursuant to subdivision
      nine of this section and all earnings accruing on such funds.
        3. As soon as practicable in the year  nineteen  hundred  eighty-eight
      and  in time for inclusion in the executive expense budget in every year
      thereafter, and at such other times as the board shall  deem  necessary,
      the  board shall submit its estimate of the amount of public funds which
      will  be  necessary  to  provide  candidates  sufficient  financing  for
      elections  in the next year in which elections are scheduled pursuant to
      the charter and for elections to fill vacancies to be held prior to such
      year, and a reserve for contingencies. Such estimates shall be submitted
      in such manner and at such times as to assure that such amounts as shall
      be necessary may be appropriated in full by the beginning of the  fiscal
      year  prior  to  that  in  which elections are scheduled pursuant to the
      charter and that additional amounts may be appropriated as necessary.
        4. The moneys in such fund shall be paid to  participating  candidates
      by  the  board  upon  its certification that such candidates qualify for
      such funds.
        5. No moneys shall be paid to participating candidates  in  a  primary
      election  any  earlier  than  two  weeks  after  the  last  day  to file
      designating petitions for such primary election.

      run-off  primary election held pursuant to section 6-162 of the election
      law or in a general election any earlier than the day after the  day  of
      the primary election held to nominate candidates for such election.
        (b)  No  moneys shall be paid to participating candidates in a run-off
      special election held to fill a vacancy any earlier than the  day  after
      the  day of the special election for which such run-off special election
      is held.
        7. No moneys shall be paid to any participating candidate who has been
      finally disqualified or whose designating or nominating  petitions  have
      been finally declared invalid by the New York city board of elections or
      a  court  of  competent  jurisdiction.  Any payment from the fund in the
      possession of such a candidate or his or her principal committee on  the
      date  of  such final disqualification or invalidation may not thereafter
      be expended for any purpose except the payment of  liabilities  incurred
      in  qualified  campaign  expenditures  before  such  date  and  shall be
      promptly repaid to the fund.
        8. Prior to the first distribution of public funds  to  candidates  in
      any election, the board shall make a determination whether the moneys in
      the  fund  are sufficient to provide all candidates the amounts they may
      receive pursuant to this chapter for all elections to be held during the
      calendar year for which such determination is made.  Such  determination
      shall  be  published  in  the  City  Record,  together  with information
      supporting such determination.
        9. The board shall be empowered to accept donations to be credited  to
      the fund. The board may devise such methods of soliciting and collecting
      donations as it may deem feasible and appropriate.

      and  any limited participating candidate for nomination or election to a
      city-wide office shall participate in either  of  the  two  pre-election
      debates,  or  both, held pursuant to this section for which he or she is
      eligible  and  is  required  to  debate  pursuant  to  this  section.  A
      participating   candidate   or   limited   participating  candidate  for
      nomination or election to a city-wide office is eligible to  participate
      in  a debate for each election in which he or she is on the ballot if he
      or she has met such criteria for participation as shall be specified  in
      any agreement between the debate sponsor and the board.
        (b) In any year in which a run-off primary or run-off special election
      to  fill  a  vacancy  for  a city-wide office is held, any participating
      candidate and any limited  participating  candidate  for  nomination  or
      election to such city-wide office who is on the ballot shall participate
      in one run-off election debate.
        (c)  In the case of a primary, the debate shall be among participating
      candidates and limited participating candidates seeking  the  nomination
      of  the  same  political  party  who  meet  the requirements provided in
      paragraph (a) of this subdivision. If there is no contested primary  for
      an  office  in  a  political  party  then  no  debate  for  that party's
      nomination shall be held pursuant to this section.
        (d) Each debate held pursuant to this section shall be  at  least  one
      hour's duration.
        2.  For  purposes of this section, a "debate" shall mean the moderated
      reciprocal discussion of issues among candidates on the ballot  for  the
      same office.
        3.  The  campaign  finance board shall select one or more sponsors for
      each debate required pursuant to this section. For primary, general  and
      special elections, the second debate shall be a debate among the leading
      contenders  for the office, as described in paragraph (b) of subdivision
      five of this section.
        4. Organizations which are not affiliated with any political party  or
      with  any  holder  of  or  candidate  for  public office, which have not
      endorsed any candidate in the  pending  primary,  special,  general,  or
      run-off  election  for the city-wide office shall be eligible to sponsor
      one or more of the required  debates.  The  rules  for  conducting  such
      debates shall be solely the responsibility of the organizations selected
      but  shall  not  be  made  final  without consultation with the campaign
      finance board. The  organizations  selected  shall  be  responsible  for
      choosing the date, time and location of the debates.
        5.  Written applications by organizations to sponsor a debate shall be
      submitted to the campaign finance board on a form provided by the  board
      not  later  than  a  date  chosen  by  the board in any year in which an
      election is held for city-wide offices.
        (a) The written application shall:
        (i) demonstrate that the organization and any proposed co-sponsor meet
      the criteria of subdivision four of this section;
        (ii) specify the election and office for which the organization  seeks
      to sponsor the debate;

      debate would be held;
        (iv) provide a detailed description of the format and ground rules for
      the debate;
        (v) verify that the staging, promotion, and  coverage  of  the  debate
      shall be in conformance with all applicable laws;
    
        (vi)  include  an  agreement  to  indemnify the city for any liability
      arising from the acts or omissions of the sponsor; and
        (vii)  set forth plans for publicity and for broadcast and other media
      coverage for the debate; and
        (viii) set forth the criteria for  determining  which  candidates  are
      eligible  to  participate  in  each  debate  the  organization  seeks to
      sponsor, in accordance with paragraph (b) of this subdivision.
        (b) (i) Except as otherwise provided in subparagraph (ii) below,  each
      debate  for  a  primary,  general or special election shall include only
      those participating candidates or limited participating  candidates  the
      sponsor  of  each  such  debate  has  determined  meet the non-partisan,
      objective, and non-discriminatory criteria set forth  in  any  agreement
      between  the sponsor and the board; provided, however, that the criteria
      for the first debate for a primary, general, or special  election  shall
      provide,  among other criteria, (A) that a participating candidate shall
      be eligible to participate in such debate if he or she has, by the  last
      filing date prior to such debate, (I) spent, contracted, or obligated to
      spend,  and  (II)  received in contributions, an amount equal to or more
      than twenty percent of the threshold for eligibility for public  funding
      applicable  to  participating candidates contained in subdivision two of
      section 3-703, and (B) that a limited participating candidate  shall  be
      eligible  to  participate  in  such debate if he or she has, by the last
      filing date prior to such debate, spent,  contracted,  or  obligated  to
      spend,  an  amount equal to or more than twenty percent of the threshold
      for  eligibility  for  public  funding   applicable   to   participating
      candidates  seeking  the  office  for  which  such  debate is being held
      contained in subdivision two of section 3-703; provided,  however,  that
      for the purpose of determining whether a candidate has met the financial
      criteria   to   be   eligible   to  participate  in  such  debate,  only
      contributions raised and spent in compliance with the act shall be  used
      to  determine  whether the candidate has raised and spent twenty percent
      of the threshold  for  eligibility  for  public  funding  applicable  to
      participating  candidates contained in subdivision two of section 3-703;
      provided, further, that the second debate for  a  primary,  general,  or
      special  election  shall  include only those participating candidates or
      limited participating candidates who the sponsor has also determined are
      leading contenders on the basis of additional  non-partisan,  objective,
      and  non-discriminatory  criteria set forth in any agreement between the
      sponsor and the board. Nothing in this provision is  intended  to  limit
      the debates to the two major political parties.
        (ii)  If  a  debate  sponsor  has  determined that a non-participating
      candidate   has   met   all    the    non-partisan,    objective,    and
      non-discriminatory  criteria  applicable  to participating candidates or
      limited participating candidates for  access  to  any  of  the  primary,
      general,  or  special  election  debates,  the  sponsor  may invite that
      candidate to participate in such  debate.  In  the  case  of  a  run-off
      primary election or a run-off special election, the sponsor may invite a
      non-participating candidate to participate in such debate. However, if a
      non-participating candidate does not accept such invitation to debate or
      does  not  appear  at  such  debate,  the  debate  shall  go  forward as
      scheduled;  provided,  however,  if  there  is  only  one  participating
      candidate  or  limited participating candidate participating in any such
      debate, such debate shall be canceled.
        6. Prior to choosing a  sponsor,  the  board  shall  provide  for  the
      receipt of comments from interested persons regarding the qualifications
      of  potential  sponsors.  The  board shall consider and give substantial
      weight to such comments submitted by candidates.
    
        7. Based upon the criteria in subdivision four above and any  comments
      received  pursuant  to subdivision six above, the board shall select the
      organization or organizations to sponsor the debates and  shall  provide
      written  notification  to the organization or organizations so selected.
      In  addition  to  the  sufficiency  of  the application, the board shall
      consider the applicant's ability to reach a wide audience and present  a
      fair  and  impartial debate. The board may accept an application subject
      to modifications as it deems appropriate and as are  acceptable  to  the
      sponsor.
        8. For all debates, the board shall provide each debate sponsor it has
      selected   with   a   list   of  participating  candidates  and  limited
      participating  candidates  who  are  eligible  to   be   considered   to
      participate in such debates.
        9.  If  a  candidate fails to participate in any debate required under
      this section before an election,  the  candidate  shall  be  liable  for
      return  of any public matching funds previously received pursuant to the
      certification filed by the candidate in connection with the election for
      which such debate is held, shall be ineligible to  receive  any  further
      matching  funds for that election, and may be subject to a civil penalty
      pursuant to section  3-711.  For  purposes  of  this  subdivision,  each
      primary,  general,  special  or  run-off  election shall be considered a
      separate election.
        10. Following the submission of a petition on behalf of the  candidate
      and  a  hearing  before the board, the sanction or sanctions provided in
      subdivision nine of this section applicable to a candidate  for  failure
      to  participate  in  any  debate  as  required under this section may be
      waived upon a determination by the board that the failure to participate
      in the debate occurred under circumstances beyond  the  control  of  the
      candidate  and  of  such  nature that a reasonable person would find the
      failure justifiable or excusable.
        11. Nothing contained in this section  shall  preclude  any  candidate
      from agreeing to participate in any number of additional debates between
      any   and   all   candidates   for   a   city-wide   office,   including
      non-participating candidates or limited participating candidates.  These
      debates need not be held under guidelines or the purview of the campaign
      finance board.
        12.  The  city  of  New  York  shall  indemnify  each  sponsor for any
      liability of such sponsor arising out of the acts or  omissions  of  the
      city  of  New  York  in  connection with the selection of candidates for
      participation in any debate held pursuant to this section 3-709.5.

        ยง  3-710  Examinations and audits; repayments. 1. The campaign finance
      board is hereby empowered to audit and examine all matters  relating  to
      the  performance  of  its functions and any other matter relating to the
      proper administration of this chapter and of chapter 8  of  title  3  of
      this  code.  The  board  shall conduct its campaign audits in accordance
      with  generally  accepted  government  auditing  standards,  and   shall
      promulgate   rules   regarding   what  documentation  is  sufficient  in
      demonstrating financial activity. These  audit  and  examination  powers
      extend   to   all   participating   candidates,   limited  participating
      candidates, and non-participating  candidates,  and  the  principal  and
      authorized  committees  of all participating, limited participating, and
      non-participating candidates, provided that:
        a. Any draft audit, the subject of which is a  participating,  limited
      participating  or  non-participating  candidate, or the principal and/or
      authorized committees of any  participating,  limited  participating  or
      non-participating  candidate  shall be completed within (i) eight months
      after the submission of the final  disclosure  report  for  the  covered
      election  for  city  council  races and borough-wide races, and (ii) ten
      months after the submission of  the  final  disclosure  report  for  the
      covered  election  for  citywide races, unless the subject of such audit
      consents in writing to a longer period of time;
        b. The campaign finance board shall provide  each  candidate  a  final
      audit,  which shall contain the final resolution of all issues raised in
      the draft audit; such final audit shall be provided  to  the  candidate,
      where  such  candidate or such candidate's campaign manager or treasurer
      has completed audit training provided by the board, within (i)  fourteen
      months  after  the  submission  of  the  final disclosure report for the
      covered election, for city council races  and  borough-wide  races,  and
      (ii)  sixteen months after the submission of the final disclosure report
      for the covered election for citywide races, unless the subject of  such
      audit  consents  in  writing  to  a  longer  period  of time. Where such
      candidate or such candidate's campaign  manager  or  treasurer  has  not
      completed  audit  training  provided by the campaign finance board, such
      final audit shall be provided  to  such  candidate  within  (i)  sixteen
      months  after  the  submission  of  the  final disclosure report for the
      covered election, for city council races  and  borough-wide  races,  and
      (ii) eighteen months after the submission of the final disclosure report
      for  the covered election for citywide races, unless the subject of such
      audit consents in writing to a longer period of time. Provided, however,
      that where the issuance of such final audit is preceded by a  notice  of
      violations  and  recommended  penalties  and/or a notice of repayment of
      public funds,  such  notice  or  notices  shall  include  all  potential
      penalties  and/or  repayment  obligations  and a notice of a candidate's
      right to a hearing pursuant to section 3-710.5 or  section  3-710(4)  of
      this  chapter  and  shall  be provided to the candidate according to the
      deadlines applicable to final audits as set forth in this paragraph.
        c. Any advice provided by board  staff  to  a  participating,  limited
      participating,  or  non-participating candidate with regard to an action
      shall be presumptive evidence that such action, if taken in reliance  on
      such  advice, should not be subject to a penalty or repayment obligation
      where such candidate or such candidate's committee  has  confirmed  such
      advice  in a writing to such board staff by registered or certified mail
      to the correct address, or by electronic or facsimile transmission  with
      evidence  of  receipt, describing the action to be taken pursuant to the
      advice given and the board or  its  staff  has  not  responded  to  such
      written  confirmation  within seven business days disavowing or altering
      such advice, provided that the board's response shall be  by  registered
    
      or  certified mail to the correct address, or by electronic or facsimile
      transmission with evidence of receipt.
        d.  Notwithstanding  the  provisions  of  paragraphs  a  and b of this
      subdivision, if a committee has failed  to  respond  to  a  request  for
      information  made  by  board  auditors  during  the  post-election audit
      process, the time period for completing the draft and final audits shall
      be tolled and extended by the number of days by which the committee  has
      exceeded  the  original  deadline  for  a  response,  provided  that the
      committee has received  timely  written  notice  of:  (i)  the  original
      deadline to provide the information, which shall not have been less than
      thirty  days  from the date such information was requested; and (ii) the
      commencement of the tolling  period  pursuant  to  this  section.  If  a
      committee  has  responded  to  a  request  for information made by board
      auditors but such response is inadequate, the time period for completing
      the draft and final audits shall be tolled and extended by the number of
      days until an adequate response is provided, provided that the committee
      has received timely written notice of:  (i)  the  original  deadline  to
      provide the information, which shall not have been less than thirty days
      from  the  date such information was requested; (ii) the commencement of
      the tolling period pursuant to this  section;  and  (iii)  the  detailed
      reasons why the original response was inadequate.
        e. Notwithstanding any provision of law to the contrary, the deadlines
      provided in paragraphs a and b of this subdivision for the completion of
      draft  and  final audits shall not apply in cases where the audit raises
      issues  involving  potential  campaign-related  fraud,  potential  other
      criminal   activity,  or  activity  that  may  constitute  a  breach  of
      certification pursuant to rules of the board  or  potential  significant
      violations of the limits set forth in section 3-706.
        f.  Notwithstanding  any  provision  of  the  law to the contrary, the
      deadlines provided in paragraphs a and b of  this  subdivision  for  the
      completion  of  draft and final audits shall not apply in the event that
      board operations are interrupted due to a catastrophic emergency such as
      a  natural  disaster  or  criminal  event,  provided  that  once   board
      operations  resume,  the  board  shall  within  two  weeks  announce new
      deadlines for the completion of draft and final audits  consistent  with
      paragraphs a and b.
        2. (a) If the board determines that any portion of the payment made to
      the  principal  committee of a participating candidate from the fund was
      in excess of the aggregate amount of payments which such  candidate  was
      eligible  to  receive  pursuant  to  this  chapter, it shall notify such
      committee and such committee shall pay to the board an amount  equal  to
      the amount of excess payments.
        b.  If  the board determines that any portion of the payment made to a
      principal committee of a participating candidate from the fund was  used
      for purposes other than qualified campaign expenditures, it shall notify
      such  candidate  and  committee  of  the amount so disqualified and such
      candidate and committee shall pay to the board an amount equal  to  such
      disqualified  amount;  provided, however, that in considering whether or
      not a participating candidate shall be required to pay to the board such
      amount or an amount less than the entire disqualified amount, the  board
      shall   act  in  accordance  with  the  following:  (i)  where  credible
      documentation supporting each qualified campaign expenditure exists  but
      is  incomplete,  the  board  shall  not  impose  such liability for such
      expenditure;  and  (ii)  where  there  is   an   absence   of   credible
      documentation  for  each  qualified  campaign expenditure, the board may
      impose  liability  upon  a  showing  that  such  absence   of   credible
      documentation  for  such  expenditure  arose  from  a  lack  of adequate
      controls  including,  but  not  limited  to  trained   staff,   internal
    
      procedures to follow published board guidelines and procedures to follow
      standard financial controls.
        (c)  If  the total of contributions, other receipts, and payments from
      the fund received by a participating candidate and his or her  principal
      committee  exceed  the total campaign expenditures of such candidate and
      committee for all covered elections held in the same  calendar  year  or
      for  a  special  election to fill a vacancy such candidate and committee
      shall use such excess funds to reimburse the fund for payments  received
      by  such  committee  from the fund during such calendar year or for such
      special election. No such excess funds  shall  be  used  for  any  other
      purpose,  unless the total amount of the payments received from the fund
      by the principal committee has been repaid.
        3. If a participating candidate whose principal committee has received
      public funds is disqualified by a court of competent jurisdiction on the
      grounds that such candidate committed fraudulent acts in order to obtain
      a place on the ballot and such decision is not reversed, such  candidate
      and  his  or  her  principal  committee shall pay to the board an amount
      equal to the total of public funds received by such principal committee.
        4. No claim for the repayment of public funds shall  be  made  against
      any  candidate  or committee without written notice to such candidate or
      committee, issued in a timely manner pursuant to all of the requirements
      of subdivision one of this section, and an opportunity to appear  before
      the  board.  Any  such  repayment  claim  shall  be  based  on  a  final
      determination issued by the board following an adjudication  before  the
      board  consistent  with  the procedures set forth in section 1046 of the
      charter unless such procedures are waived by the candidate or  principal
      committee.  Such  final determination shall be included in and made part
      of the final audit which shall be issued  within  thirty  days  of  such
      determination.

        ยง  3-710.5  Findings  of violation or infraction; adjudications; final
      determinations. (i) The board shall determine  whether  a  participating
      candidate, his or her principal committee, principal committee treasurer
      or  any  other  agent  of  a  participating  candidate  has  committed a
      violation or infraction of any provision of this chapter  or  the  rules
      promulgated  hereunder,  for  which the board may assess a civil penalty
      pursuant to section 3-711 of this chapter. The  board  shall  promulgate
      rules  defining infractions, and such definitions shall include, but not
      be limited to, failures to comply with the provisions of this chapter or
      the rules promulgated hereunder that are limited and non-repetitive.
        (ii) (a) The board shall give written notice and  the  opportunity  to
      appear  before  the board to any participating, limited participating or
      non-participating candidate, his or her principal committee,  authorized
      committee,  committee treasurer or any other agent of such candidate, if
      the board has reason to believe that such has committed a  violation  or
      infraction  before  assessing  any  penalty  for  such  action. Any such
      written notice of alleged violations shall be issued in a timely  manner
      pursuant  to all of the requirements of subdivision one of section 3-710
      and shall precede the issuance of the final audit required  pursuant  to
      subdivision one of section 3-710. In the case of a written notice issued
      prior  to the date of a covered election, or after the date of a covered
      election in the case of a notice regarding an alleged failure to respond
      to a request for audit documentation, such notice may be issued prior to
      the issuance of a draft audit. Alleged violations and proposed penalties
      shall  be  subject  to  resolution  by  adjudication  before  the  board
      consistent  with  the  procedures of section 1046 of the charter, unless
      such procedures are waived by  the  candidate  or  principal  committee;
      provided,  however, that in the case of adjudications conducted prior to
      the date of a covered election, the board shall use  the  procedures  of
      section  1046  of  the charter only to the extent practicable, given the
      expedited nature of such pre-election  adjudications.  The  board  shall
      issue  a final determination within thirty days of the conclusion of the
      adjudication proceeding.
        (b) The board shall include in every final determination:  (i)  notice
      of  the respondent's right to bring a special proceeding challenging the
      board's final determination in New York State supreme court pursuant  to
      article  78  of the civil practice law and rules; and (ii) notice of the
      commencement of the  four-month  period  during  which  such  a  special
      proceeding  may  be  brought pursuant to article 2 of the civil practice
      law and rules.

      participating or non-participating candidate's name is  one  of  several
      names  appearing on the communication and is of equivalent prominence as
      the other names.
        (c) Fundraising assistance to another candidate in the form of written
      communications  that  do  not  promote  the  participating,  or  limited
      participating  or non-participating candidate, such as the appearance of

      candidate  or  the  appearance  of  such   participating,   or   limited
      participating  or  non-participating  candidate's  name  on  fundraising
      material  where  such  participating,  or   limited   participating   or
      non-participating candidate's name appears alone or with other names and
      is of equivalent prominence as the other names.

      members,  and  the  communication does not solicit funds on behalf of or
      otherwise promote such candidate's campaign for a covered election.

      of paragraph (d) of subdivision  two,  shall  be  contributions  to  and
      expenditures   by   the   participating,  or  limited  participating  or
      non-participating candidate. Among the factors the board shall  consider
      in  determining  the value of the contribution to and expenditure by the
      participating, or limited participating or  non-participating  candidate
      are the following factors:
        (a) the focus of the communication;
        (b) the geographical distribution or location of the communication;

      communication;

      paragraph  f  of  subdivision  one  of section 3-703 as of the date such
      contributions are received, as adjusted pursuant to subdivision seven of
      section 3-703. Contributions received pursuant to this section shall not
      be aggregated with contributions received during  the  covered  election
      for  which  the  debt  was  incurred  for  the  purposes  of determining
      compliance with such contribution limitations.
        4. After all debt referred to in subdivision one has been repaid,  the
      participating candidate shall no longer accept contributions pursuant to
      this  section.  If  any  excess  funds  remain  after such debt has been
    
      repaid, the participating candidate shall return such  excess  funds  to

      recent contributor, until the excess funds are exhausted.
