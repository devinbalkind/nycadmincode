      other person in charge of any building in the  city  upon  a  street  to
      which street numbers of buildings have been assigned by the president of
      the  borough  in which such building is situated, shall cause the proper
      street number or numbers of such  buildings  to  be  displayed  in  such

      building, or premises on which such  building  is  situated,  have  been

      of any building in the city upon a street to  which  street  numbers  of
      buildings  have  been  assigned by the president of the borough in which
      such building is situated shall fail to display the proper street number
      of  such  building,  as  provided  in  the  foregoing  subdivision,  the
      president  of  the  borough  in  which  such  building is situated shall
      forthwith serve such person or persons with a copy of this section,  and
      if after thirty days' notice the owner, lessee, agent or other person in
      charge  of  such  building  shall  fail  or  neglect  to comply with the
      provisions thereof,  he  or  she  shall  be  subject  to  a  penalty  of
      twenty-five  dollars,  which shall be sued for and collected in the name
      of the city. Any person who shall continue any such offense shall pay an
      additional sum of five dollars for each day such offense shall continue.

      having  jurisdiction shall thereafter adjust and renumber such street as
      the same may be required from time to time. In numbering and renumbering
      houses, the borough president shall leave  sufficient  numbers  on  each
      block,  so  that,  under any circumstances, there would be but one block
      where a change  would  be  required,  in  case  of  renumbering  at  any

      bolt, which has been set by  proper  authority,  or  designated  on  any
      official  map  as  a  landmark  to  denote street lines within the city,
      unless a permit therefor has been obtained from  the  president  of  the

      such permits shall be in writing, and shall set forth the nature of  the
      work  proposed,  and  the  location  of all monuments or other landmarks

      monuments or bolts to their correct position after the completion of the

      street,  without  giving  three  days'  notice  in writing of his or her
      intention so to do to the commissioner  of  transportation  and  to  the
      president of the borough in which the monument or bolt is situated. Upon
      receiving  such  a  notice, the borough president shall cause one of the
      city surveyors, or an engineer in the borough president's office to take
      the necessary measures to raise or lower such monument or  bolt  to  the
      proper  grade  of  the  street,  and,  when  necessary,  to  cause  such
      alteration to be noted on records to be kept in the borough  president's
      office  for  that  purpose. Whenever a borough president shall ascertain
      that any monument or bolt has been removed, without such notice,  he  or
      she  shall forthwith cause the same to be placed in its proper position,
      and shall note the same  on  the  records  in  the  manner  hereinbefore
      stated.  The  expenses  attending  such replacement shall be paid by the
      comptroller, on the certificate of the  borough  president  causing  the
      work to be done.
