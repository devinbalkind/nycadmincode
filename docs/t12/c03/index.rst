      disposition  to  the  appellate  division of the supreme court. Where an
      issue specified in question four of section seven thousand eight hundred
      three of the civil practice  law  and  rules  is  raised,  either  in  a
      proceeding  to  enforce  or  review an order of the board, the appellate
      division of the supreme court, upon completion of proceedings before it,
      shall remit a copy of its judgment or order to the court  in  which  the
      proceeding  was  commenced,  which  court shall have the power to compel
      compliance with such judgment or order.
        c. In a proceeding to enforce or review an order  of  the  board,  the
      court  shall  have  power  to grant such temporary relief or restraining
      order as it deems just and proper, and to make and enter a  judgment  or
      decree  enforcing,  modifying  and  enforcing as so modified, or setting
      aside in whole or in part the order of the board.

      adoption of rules. a. Meetings of board of  collective  bargaining.  (1)
      The  board of collective bargaining shall hold special meetings upon the
      call of the director or the request of any two members.  Written  notice
      of all regular and special meetings, including agendas and amendments to
      agendas  shall  be  given  to  each  board  member,  including alternate
      members, not more than ten days nor less than one day prior to any  such
      meeting. A quorum shall consist of one city member, one labor member and
      one impartial member or of any four members.
        (2)  The board of collective bargaining, or such members thereof as it
      may designate, shall conduct meetings  between  representatives  of  the
      city   responsible  for  labor  relations  and  representatives  of  the
      municipal labor committee at least twice a year, and at such other times
      as the director determines. These meetings shall not take up  grievances
      or  negotiate  changes in wages, hours, or working conditions, but shall
      deal with problems of general application, including those  arising  out
      of  the  administration of the procedures set forth in this chapter. The
      director shall also from time to time convene similar  meetings  between
      representatives   of   particular   employers   and  certified  employee
      organizations.
        b. Meetings of board of  certification.  The  board  of  certification
      shall hold regular and special meetings upon the call of the chairperson
      or  of  the other two members, but shall meet at least ten times a year.
      Two members shall constitute a quorum.
        c. Vote required.  Except  as  otherwise  specifically  provided,  all
      actions,  determinations,  findings, and recommendations of the board of
      collective bargaining  and  the  board  of  certification  shall  be  by
      majority vote of members present and voting. In the absence of a city or
      labor  member,  or in the event of a vacancy, an alternate member of the
      board of collective bargaining may vote in the place and  stead  of  the
      member  for  whom  he or she is the alternate, or on account of whom the
      vacancy exists.
        d. Promulgation of rules. Rules and amendments to rules promulgated by
      the board of collective bargaining or the board of  certification  shall
      be in conformity with the requirements of chapter forty-five of the city

Section 12-311 ::    
        
     
        §  12-311  Bargaining notice; mediation; impasse panels. a. Bargaining
      notices. (1) At such time  prior  to  the  expiration  of  a  collective
      bargaining agreement as may be specified therein (or, if no such time is
      specified,  at  least  ninety  but  not more than one hundred fifty days
      prior to expiration of the agreement) a public employer, or a  certified
      or  designated  employee  organization,  which  desires  to negotiate on
      matters within the scope of bargaining shall send the other party  (with
      a  copy  to  the  director)  a  notice  of the desire to negotiate a new
      collective bargaining agreement  on  such  matters.  The  parties  shall
      commence negotiations within ten days after receipt of such a bargaining
      notice,  unless such time is extended by agreement of the parties, or by
      the director or the board of collective bargaining.
        (2) At any time after a public employee organization  has  been  newly
      certified   or  designated  to  represent  the  public  employees  in  a
      designated bargaining unit, the public employer or the  newly  certified
      or  designated  employee  organization,  if  it  desires to negotiate on
      matters within the scope of collective bargaining, may  send  the  other
      party (with a copy to the director) a bargaining notice for the terms of
      a  collective  bargaining  agreement  on such matters. The parties shall
      commence negotiations within ten days after receipt of such a bargaining
      notice, unless such time is extended by agreement of the parties, or  by
      the director or the board of collective bargaining.
        (3)  Nothing  herein  shall authorize or require collective bargaining
      between parties to a collective bargaining  agreement  during  the  term
      thereof,  except  that  such parties may engage in collective bargaining
      during such term on a matter within the scope of  collective  bargaining
      where  (a)  the  matter was not specifically covered by the agreement or
      raised as an issue during the negotiations out of which such  agreements
      arose   and  (b)  there  shall  have  arisen  a  significant  change  in
      circumstances with respect to such matter, which  could  not  reasonably
      have  been  anticipated  by both parties at the time of the execution of
      such agreement.
        b. Mediation panels. (1) The office  of  collective  bargaining  shall
      maintain  a  register  of  mediators  who have been approved for listing
      thereon by the board of collective bargaining.
        (2) If the director, upon the request of a party or upon  his  or  her
      own   initiative  determines  that  collective  bargaining  negotiations
      between a  public  employer  and  a  certified  or  designated  employee
      organization  would  be  aided  by  mediation, he or she shall appoint a
      mediation panel from such register to assist the parties in arriving  at
      an  agreement. A mediation panel shall not be appointed less than thirty
      days after the commencement of negotiations, unless  requested  by  both
      parties.  It  shall  be  the  duty  of the parties to cooperate with the
      mediation panel to arrive at an agreement.
        (3) The mediation panel shall perform its  duties  under  the  general
      direction and guidance of the director, to whom it shall report.
        c.  Impasse  panels.  (1)  The  office  of collective bargaining shall
      maintain a register of impasse panel members who have been approved  for
      listing  thereon  by  a  majority  of  the  entire  board  of collective
      bargaining, including at least one city member and one labor member.
        (2) If the board of collective bargaining, upon recommendation of  the
      director,  determines  that  collective bargaining negotiations (with or
      without  mediation)  between  a  public  employer  and  a  certified  or
      designated  employee  organization  have  been  exhausted,  and that the
      conditions are appropriate for the creation  of  an  impasse  panel,  it
      shall  promptly  instruct  the  director  to  appoint  such a panel. The
      director may also appoint an impasse panel upon request of both parties.
      In appointing a panel, the director shall submit to the parties a single
    
      list of seven persons from the register of impasse  panel  members,  and
      each  party  shall inform the director of its preferences. To the extent
      the preferences disclose agreement, the person or  persons  agreed  upon
      shall  be  appointed to the impasse panel; to the extent the preferences
      are not in agreement,  the  director  shall  proceed  to  designate  the
      members  of  such  panel  from  the  register. Each party may at its own
      expense designate a  consultant  to  an  impasse  panel,  who  shall  be
      available to the panel for assistance.
        (3)  (a)  An impasse panel shall have power to mediate, hold hearings,
      compel the attendance of witnesses  and  the  production  of  documents,
      review  data, and take whatever action it considers necessary to resolve
      the impasse. If an impasse panel is unable to resolve an impasse  within
      a  reasonable  period  of time, as determined by the director, it shall,
      within such period of time as the director prescribes, render a  written
      report containing findings of fact, conclusions, and recommendations for
      terms of settlement.
        (b)  An  impasse  panel  appointed  pursuant  to paragraph two of this
      subdivision c shall consider wherever relevant the  following  standards
      in making its recommendations for terms of settlement:
        (i)  comparison  of  the wages, hours, fringe benefits, conditions and
      characteristics of employment of the public employees  involved  in  the
      impasse  proceeding  with  the wages, hours, fringe benefits, conditions
      and characteristics of employment of other employees performing  similar
      work  and  other  employees generally in public or private employment in
      New York city or comparable communities;
        (ii) the overall compensation paid to the employees  involved  in  the
      impasse  proceeding,  including  direct  wage compensation, overtime and
      premium pay, vacations, holidays  and  other  excused  time,  insurance,
      pensions,   medical  and  hospitalization  benefits,  food  and  apparel
      furnished, and all other benefits received;
        (iii) changes in the average consumer prices for goods  and  services,
      commonly known as the cost of living;
        (iv) the interest and welfare of the public;
        (v)  such  other factors as are normally and customarily considered in
      the determination of wages, hours, fringe benefits,  and  other  working
      conditions in collective bargaining or in impasse panel proceedings.
        (c) The report of an impasse panel shall be confined to matters within
      the  scope  of collective bargaining. Unless the mayor agrees otherwise,
      an impasse panel shall make no report concerning the  basic  salary  and
      increment  structure  and pay plan rules of the city's career and salary
      plan. If an impasse panel makes  a  recommendation  on  a  matter  which
      requires  implementation  by  a  body, agency or official which is not a
      party to the negotiations: (i)  it  shall  address  such  recommendation
      solely  to  such  other  body,  agency  or  official;  (ii) it shall not
      recommend or direct that the municipal agency or other  public  employer
      which  is  party  to the negotiations shall support such recommendation;
      and (iii) it may recommend whether  a  collective  bargaining  agreement
      should  be  concluded  prior  to  such  implementation.  Any alternative
      recommendations  proposed  by  an  impasse  panel  in  the  event   such
      implementation  does  not  occur  shall not exceed the total cost of the
      original recommendations.
        (d) The report of an impasse panel shall be submitted to  the  parties
      to  the negotiations, to any other body, agency or official whose action
      is required  to  implement  the  panel's  recommendations,  and  to  the
      director.  The director shall, with the advice and guidance of the board
      of  collective bargaining, determine the time at which such report shall
      be released to the public, which shall not  be  later  than  seven  days
      after  its  submission or, upon agreement of the parties and approval of
    
      the director, not later than thirty days after its submission,  provided
      that  if the parties conclude a collective bargaining agreement prior to
      the date on which the report is to be released, the report shall not  be
      released except upon consent of the parties.
        (e)  Acceptance  or rejection. Within ten days after submission of the
      panel's  report  and  recommendations,  or  such  additional  time   not
      exceeding  thirty  days  as  the  director  may permit, each party shall
      notify the other party and the director, in writing, of  its  acceptance
      or  rejection of the panel's recommendations. Failure to so notify shall
      be deemed acceptance of the recommendations. The  director  may  release
      the acceptance or rejections to the public at such time as the director,
      in  his  or  her  discretion, may deem advisable. Upon acceptance by all
      parties or ten days after the latest rejection by any party,  unless  an
      appeal  is  earlier filed with the board pursuant to subparagraph (a) of
      paragraph four of this  subdivision,  the  recommendation  shall  become
      final  and  binding  and shall constitute an award within the meaning of
      article seventy-five of the civil  practice  law  and  rules,  provided,
      however,  that  any provisions of such award the implementation of which
      requires the enactment of a law  shall  not  become  binding  until  the
      appropriate legislative body enacts such law.
        (4) Review of impasse panel recommendations:
        (a)  A  party who rejects in whole or in part the recommendation of an
      impasse panel as provided in subparagraph (e) of paragraph three of this
      subdivision may appeal to the board of collective bargaining for  review
      of the recommendations of the impasse panel by filing a notice of appeal
      with  said board within ten days of such rejection. The notice of appeal
      shall also be served upon the  other  parties  within  said  time.  Upon
      failure  to  appeal within the time provided herein, the recommendations
      shall be final and binding upon the  party  failing  to  so  appeal,  as
      provided  in  subparagraph  (e)  of paragraph three of this subdivision,
      except  that  the  board,  upon   its   own   initiative,   may   review
      recommendations  which  have been rejected. Panel recommendations which,
      pursuant to the  provisions  of  this  subparagraph,  become  final  and
      binding  on both parties shall constitute an award within the meaning of
      article seventy-five of the civil  practice  law  and  rules,  provided,
      however,  that  any  provision of such award the implementation of which
      requires the enactment of a law  shall  not  become  binding  until  the
      appropriate legislative body enacts such law.
        (b)  The  notice  of  appeal  shall specify the grounds upon which the
      appeal is taken, the alleged errors of the panel, and the  modifications
      requested.  The  board shall afford the parties a reasonable opportunity
      to argue orally before it or  to  submit  briefs,  or  may  permit  both
      argument  and  briefs. Review of the recommendations shall be based upon
      the record and evidence made and produced before the impasse  panel  and
      the  standards  set forth in subparagraph (b) of paragraph three of this
      subdivision and shall  include  consideration  of  issues,  if  any,  of
      conformity  of  the  recommendations with any law or regulation properly
      governing the conduct of collective bargaining between the city  of  New
      York  and its employees, provided, however, that when an appeal is taken
      to  the  board  on  any  of  the  grounds  of  prejudice  set  forth  in
      subparagraph  (i),  (ii) or (iii) of paragraph one of subdivision (b) of
      section seventy-five hundred eleven of the civil practice law and rules,
      review shall also be based upon the record made in any hearing which the
      board may direct on such  issues,  provided,  however,  that  the  board
      orders  such  hearing  within thirty days of the filing of the notice of
      appeal.
        (c) Upon such review,  the  board  may  affirm  or  modify  the  panel
      recommendations   in   whole   or   in   part.  A  modification  of  the
    
      recommendations shall be by the vote of a majority  of  the  board.  The
      board  may  also  set  aside  the recommendations of an impasse panel in
      whole or in part if it finds that  the  rights  of  a  party  have  been
      prejudiced  on any of the grounds set forth in subparagraph (i), (ii) or
      (iii) of paragraph one of subdivision b of section seventy-five  hundred
      eleven  of  the  civil  practice law and rules. An order setting aside a
      recommendation of such grounds shall be based on a written decision  and
      shall  be  made  upon a vote of a majority of the board. A member of the
      board who has acted as a  member  of  an  impasse  panel  shall  not  be
      disqualified   from   subsequently   participating   in  a  decision  or
      determination of the board in the same dispute.
        (d) The recommendations of the impasse panel shall be deemed  to  have
      been  adopted  by  the  board  if  the  board  fails  to  issue  a final
      determination within thirty days of filing of the notice of  appeal,  or
      within  forty days of a notification of rejection to the director of the
      board where the board, upon its  own  initiative,  reviews  the  panel's
      recommendations,  provided,  however,  that  when  a  hearing is ordered
      pursuant  to  subparagraph  (b)  of  this  paragraph  four  relating  to
      allegations  of  prejudice, the impasse panel's recommendations shall be
      deemed to have been adopted by the board only  if  the  board  fails  to
      issue a determination thereon within thirty days after the close of such
      hearing,  and  provided further, that the director may extend the thirty
      day  or  forty  day  periods  mentioned  in  this  subparagraph  for  an
      additional period not to exceed thirty days.
        (e)  Notwithstanding the provisions of this paragraph four, and except
      for purposes of judicial review, any provision of a determination of the
      board of collective bargaining the implementation of which requires  the
      enactment  of  a  law  shall  not  become  binding until the appropriate
      legislative body enacts such law.
        (f) A final determination of the board pursuant either to subparagraph
      (c) or (d) of this paragraph four shall be  binding  upon  the  parties.
      Such  a final determination shall constitute an award within the meaning
      of article seventy-five of the civil practice law and rules.
        d. Preservation of status  quo.  During  the  period  of  negotiations
      between  a public employer and a public employee organization concerning
      a collective bargaining agreement, and, if an impasse panel is appointed
      during the period  commencing  on  the  date  on  which  such  panel  is
      appointed  and  ending  sixty  days  thereafter or thirty days after the
      panel submits its report, whichever is sooner, provided,  however,  that
      upon  motion  of  the  panel,  and  for  good  cause shown, the board of
      collective bargaining may allow a maximum of two sixty-day extensions of
      time for the completion of impasse panel proceedings, provided  further,
      that  additional  extensions of time for the completion of impasse panel
      proceedings may be granted by the panel upon the joint  request  of  the
      parties,  and  during  the  pendency  of  any  appeal  to  the  board of
      collective bargaining pursuant to subdivision c  of  this  section,  the
      public  employee  organization party to the negotiations, and the public
      employees it represents, shall not induce  or  engage  in  any  strikes,
      slowdowns,  work  stoppages,  or mass absenteeism, nor shall such public
      employee organization induce  any  mass  resignations,  and  the  public
      employer  shall  refrain  from  unilateral  changes  in wages, hours, or
      working conditions. This subdivision shall not be construed to limit the
      rights  of  public  employers  other  than  their  right  to  make  such
      unilateral  changes,  or  the  rights and duties of public employees and
      employee  organizations  under  state  law.  For  the  purpose  of  this
      subdivision  the  term  "period  of  negotiations" shall mean the period
      commencing on the date on which a bargaining notice is filed and  ending
    
      on  the  date on which a collective bargaining agreement is concluded or
      an impasse panel is appointed.
        e.  Number  of  members  on  panels;  vote required. (1) Mediation and
      impasse panels shall consist of such odd number of persons (one or more)
      as may be agreed upon by the parties to the  negotiations,  or,  in  the
      absence  of  such  agreement,  as  shall  be  deemed  appropriate by the
      director. (2) All actions, determinations, findings and  recommendations
      of an impasse panel shall be by majority vote.
        f.  Anything  in  this  chapter  notwithstanding, public employers and
      certified or designated employee organizations hereby are  empowered  to
      enter  into written agreements setting forth procedures to be invoked in
      the event of an impasse in collective bargaining negotiations, and  such
      agreements   may  include  the  undertaking  by  each  party  to  submit
      unresolved issues to impartial arbitration, provided  that  (1)  if  the
      agreement  between  the parties fails to provide procedures which result
      in a final determination of  all  issues,  then  all  unresolved  issues
      between  the parties shall be subject to the provisions of subdivision c
      of this section or so much  thereof  as  may  be  applicable  under  the
      circumstances, and
        (2)  questions, issues or disputes as to arbitrability or the scope of
      collective bargaining shall be determined by  the  board  of  collective
      bargaining only.

--------------

Section 12-312 ::    
        
     
        §  12-312  Grievance procedure and impartial arbitration. a. The board
      of collective bargaining shall maintain a register  of  arbitrators  who
      have been approved for listing thereon by a majority of the entire board
      of  collective  bargaining  including  at  least one city member and one
      labor  member.  The  board  of  collective  bargaining  shall  establish
      procedures  for  impartial  arbitration  which  may be incorporated into
      executive orders and collective  bargaining  agreements  between  public
      employers and public employee organizations.
        b.  Executive  orders,  and  collective  bargaining agreements between
      public  employers  and  public  employee  organizations,   may   contain
      provisions for grievance procedures, in steps terminating with impartial
      arbitration  of  unresolved grievances. Such provisions may provide that
      the arbitrator's award shall be final and binding and enforceable in any
      appropriate tribunal in accordance with  the  applicable  law  governing
      arbitration,  except  that awards as to grievances concerning assignment
      of employees to duties substantially  different  from  those  stated  in
      their  job  classifications,  or the use of open-competitive rather than
      promotional examinations, shall be final  and  binding  and  enforceable
      only to the extent permitted by law.
        c.  Arbitrators  appointed  under  arbitration  provisions relating to
      municipal agencies shall be persons on the  register  of  the  board  of
      collective bargaining. The costs of such arbitration shall be determined
      and  allocated  pursuant  to  section eleven hundred seventy-four of the
      charter. The board of collective  bargaining,  in  its  discretion,  may
      publish arbitration awards.
        d. As a condition to the right of a municipal employee organization to
      invoke  impartial  arbitration  under  such  provisions, the grievant or
      grievants and such organization shall  be  required  to  file  with  the
      director  a  written  waiver  of  the right, if any, of said grievant or
      grievants and said organization to submit the contractual dispute  being
      alleged   under   a   collective   bargaining  agreement  to  any  other
      administrative or judicial tribunal except for the purpose of  enforcing
      the arbitrator's award. This subdivision shall not be construed to limit
      the  rights  of  any  public employee or public employee organization to
      submit any statutory or other claims to the  appropriate  administrative
      or judicial tribunal.
        e. Public employees and public employee organizations shall not induce
      or engage in any strikes, slowdowns, work stoppages, or mass absenteeism
      nor  shall  public  employee  organizations induce any mass resignations
      during the term of a collective bargaining  agreement.  A  provision  to
      that  effect  shall  be  inserted  in  all written collective bargaining
      agreements between public employers and public  employee  organizations.
      This  subdivision  shall  not be construed to limit the rights of public
      employers or the duties of public employees and  employee  organizations
      under state law.
        f.  It  is  hereby  declared to be the policy of the city that written
      collective bargaining agreements with certified or  designated  employee
      organizations  should  contain  provisions  for grievance procedures and
      impartial binding arbitration, which may be invoked by a public employer
      or by a certified or designated employee organization.
        g. An employee may present his or her own grievance either  personally
      or through an appropriate representative, provided that:
        (1)  a  grievance  relating  to a matter referred to in paragraph two,
      three or five of subdivision a of section 12-307 of this chapter may  be
      presented  and  processed  only  by  the  employee or by the appropriate
      designated representative or its  designee,  but  only  the  appropriate
      designated representative or its designee shall have the right to invoke
      and  utilize the arbitration procedure provided by executive order or in
    
      the collective agreement to which the  designated  representative  is  a
      party; and provided further that
        (2) any other grievance of an employee in a unit for which an employee
      organization  is  the certified collective bargaining representative may
      be presented and processed only by, the employee  or  by  the  certified
      employee  organization,  but  only  the  certified employee organization
      shall have the right to invoke and  utilize  the  arbitration  procedure
      provided  by executive order or in the collective agreement to which the
      certified representative is a party.

        § 12-313 Membership and rules of municipal labor committee. Membership
      in the municipal labor committee shall be open to any certified employee
      organization  as defined in this chapter and which is otherwise eligible
      for  membership  under  the  rules  of  such  committee.  The  board  of
      collective  bargaining  may,  upon the request of any certified employee
      organization, abrogate any rule of such committee relating to voting  or
      eligibility  for  membership  which  it  determines  to  be arbitrary or
      discriminatory,  provided  that  prior  to  any  such  abrogation   such
      committee  shall be given an opportunity on at least ten days' notice to
      be heard thereon.
    
    
    
    
    
    
    

Section 12-314
--------------

Section 12-314 ::    
        
     
        §  12-314 Special provisions relating to initial certification. a. Any
      employee organization which (1) discriminates with regard to  the  terms
      and  conditions  of  membership because of race, color, creed, religion,
      disability, gender, sexual orientation, age, or national origin, or  (2)
      is  engaged  in  or advocates the violent overthrow of the government of
      the United States or of any state or any political  subdivision  thereof
      shall  be  ineligible  for  certification  as  an  exclusive  bargaining
      representative. For purposes of this section, the finding of a court  or
      an  administrative  tribunal  of competent jurisdiction that an employee
      organization has engaged in discrimination upon one of the  above  bases
      in  a  particular  case shall not be dispositive of the question of that
      employee organization's eligibility for certification unless it is  also
      found  that  the  employee  organization  has  engaged  in  a pattern or
      practice of such discrimination generally.
        b. No organization seeking or claiming to  represent  members  of  the
      police  force  of  the  police  department  shall  be  certified if such
      organization (i) admits to membership,  or  is  affiliated  directly  or
      indirectly  with  an  organization which admits to membership, employees
      other than members of the police force of the police department, or (ii)
      advocates the right to strike.
        c. Certificates or designations issued  by  the  department  of  labor
      prior  to  the effective date of this chapter and in effect on such date
      shall remain in effect until terminated by the  board  of  certification
      pursuant to its rules. Nothing contained in this subdivision shall limit
      the  power  of  the board of certification to determine bargaining units
      differing from those determined by the department of labor.

      least five other members of the  board  of  collective  bargaining,  may
      delegate   to  independent  and  impartial  private  institutions  those
      functions of the office of collective bargaining  relating  to  (a)  the
      maintenance  of  registers  of  mediators,  arbitrators,  and members of
      impasse panels, (b) the submission  of  the  names  of  persons  on  the
      impasse  panel  and  arbitration  registers  for selection by parties to
      negotiations or to a grievance, and (c) the  conduct  of  representation
      and decertification elections.
    
    
    
    
    
    
    

Section 12-316
--------------

Section 12-316 ::    
        
     
        §  12-316  Emergency  suspension  of salary and wages. a. It is hereby
      found and declared that a fiscal emergency exists for the  city  of  New
      York  by reason of the following: As a result of the severe economic and
      social dislocations of recent years, there has been a great increase  in
      the  need  and  demand for public services at a time when financing such
      services has become increasingly difficult. Due to a general decline  in
      investor   acceptance   of   local   government  securities  and  almost
      unprecedented high interest rates, the city of  New  York,  despite  the
      financial  soundness  of  its  obligations, recently has faced increased
      difficulty in selling a sufficient amount of its securities to enable it
      to refund its outstanding obligations or to meet its cash  requirements.
      For  the  immediate future, this increased difficulty has caused concern
      that it may be unable to provide, without  interruption,  many  services
      essential  to  its  inhabitants  while  also  meeting obligations to the
      holders of its outstanding securities as they come due.  It  is  in  the
      public interest and it is the policy of the city of New York to provide,
      without  interruption,  services  essential  to  its  inhabitants  while
      meeting its obligations to the holders of  its  outstanding  securities.
      The  state of New York, in an attempt to assist the city of New York and
      other municipalities faced by a similar or analogous problem has enacted
      chapter one hundred sixty-eight and one hundred sixty-nine of  the  laws
      of  nineteen hundred seventy-five, which among other provisions create a
      municipal assistance corporation for the city of New York, empowering it
      to issue bonds and notes  and  to  use  the  proceeds  from  their  sale
      primarily  to  provide  the  city  of  New  York with amounts to pay the
      short-term obligations of the city as  they  mature.  Despite  statutory
      provisions  which,  in  effect, secure the bonds and notes issued by the
      municipal assistance corporation for the city of New York with  all  the
      proceeds  of  the  state  stock  transfer tax and of the state municipal
      assistance sales and compensating use taxes to  the  extent  needed  for
      that  purpose, despite the agreement of the city of New York to make and
      observe such changes in its record keeping,  accounting,  budgeting  and
      financial  management  practices as the municipal assistance corporation
      for the city of New York  requires  pursuant  to  such  legislation  and
      despite  numerous  economy  measures  taken  by  the  city  of New York,
      including a substantial reduction in the number of  its  employees,  the
      municipal  assistance  corporation  for  the  city  of New York has been
      experiencing difficulty in selling the  bonds  it  has  issued  and  has
      expressed  grave  concern with regard to its ability to sell bonds which
      it plans to issue in the near future. The city of New York, as a result,
      is faced by a fiscal emergency which could seriously impair its  ability
      to  carry  on  orderly  and  uninterrupted  operations  and functions of
      government. Imposing certain additional nuisance taxes which  the  state
      in  the  past  had  given  it power to impose is not a feasible solution
      since to do so may further impair the city's credit standing because the
      burden of present taxes has contributed  to  flight  from  the  city  of
      middleclass  taxpaying  residents  and of a number of business firms. In
      view of this situation, it is necessary for the  city  to  exercise  its
      sovereign  police  power  to  suspend  salary  increases  in  the manner
      provided in subdivision b of this section.
        b. The mayor shall have the power to direct by  executive  order  that
      all  or  any  part  of  increases in salary or wages of public employees
      which  have  taken  effect  since  June  thirtieth,   nineteen   hundred
      seventy-five  or  which  will  take  effect  after that date pursuant to
      collective bargaining agreements or other analogous contracts  requiring
      such salary increases as of July first, nineteen hundred seventy-five or
      as  of  any  date  thereafter  shall  be  suspended.  All or any part of
      increased  payments  for  holiday  and  vacation  differentials,   shift
    
      differentials,  salary  adjustments  according  to  plan and step-ups or
      increments which  have  taken  effect  since  June  thirtieth,  nineteen
      hundred  seventy-five or which will take effect after that date pursuant
      to   collective  bargaining  agreements  or  other  analogous  contracts
      requiring such increased payment, as of  July  first,  nineteen  hundred
      seventy-five  or  as  of any date thereafter may, in the same manner, be
      suspended. For the purposes of computing the pension base of  retirement
      allowances,  the  suspended  salary  or wage increases and the suspended
      other payment shall not be considered as part of compensation  or  final
      compensation  or  of  annual  salary earned or earnable. The suspensions
      provided herein shall be effective for the first pay period ending on or
      subsequent to September first, nineteen hundred seventy-five  and  shall
      continue until one year thereafter.
        c. This section shall not be applicable to public employees covered by
      a  collective bargaining agreement or a public employee not covered by a
      collective  bargaining  agreement  where   the   collective   bargaining
      representative  or  such  unrepresented  employee,  by  an instrument in
      writing, has agreed to a deferment of salary or wage increase which  has
      been  certified  by  the  mayor  as  being an acceptable and appropriate
      contribution toward alleviating the city's fiscal crisis. The mayor may,
      if he or she finds that the fiscal crisis has been alleviated or for any
      other appropriate reason, direct by executive order that the suspensions
      of salary or wage increases or suspension of  other  increased  payments
      shall, in whole or in part, be terminated.
        d.  Notwithstanding  the provisions of section 12-304 of this chapter,
      this section shall be applicable  to  all  public  employees,  including
      public employees of any public employer as defined in this chapter.
