Section 23-403
--------------

Section 23-403 ::    
        
     
        §  23-403  Powers  of  commissioner. a. The commissioner may issue and
      renew permits under this chapter based upon a determination, at  his  or
      her  discretion,  that  issuance  or renewal of a permit would be in the
      best interests of the city, provided that:
        1. no permit shall be issued or renewed unless the applicant  holds  a
      franchise  granted  by  the city to install, operate and maintain public
      pay telephones on, over and under  the  streets  and  other  inalienable
      property of the city;
        2.  (i)  in  the event that the installation of a public pay telephone
      requires the  opening,  drilling  or  other  physical  alteration  of  a
      building  facade or other private property, no permit shall be issued or
      renewed without the written consent of the building owner.
        (ii) in the event that the installation  of  a  public  pay  telephone
      requires  affixing  the  phone  to  a  building  facade or other private
      property, no permit shall be  issued  or  renewed  without  the  written
      consent of the building owner.
        (iii) in the event the installation of a public pay telephone is to be
      accomplished  in  a manner other than as set forth in subsection (i) and
      (ii) of this section, but requires access through an existing conduit or
      other opening on a building facade or other private  property,  or  such
      installation is to be made within six feet of a building line, no permit
      shall  be  issued or renewed without the written consent of the building
      owner or the commercial lessee who shall certify (aa) that the  building
      owner  has  authorized  the lessee to grant such consents; and (bb) that
      the lessee has provided the building owner or its authorized agent  with
      written notification by certified mail, of the granting of such consent,
      the  name  and  address of the owner of the public pay telephone and the
      location of such public pay telephone in relation to the building. Proof
      of mailing of such notification to the building owner or its  authorized
      agent  shall  be  included  in  the  permit  application.  It shall be a
      violation  of  this  chapter  where  a  permittee,   without   providing
      justification  therefor,  fails  within  a  time period specified by the
      Commissioner to remove a public pay telephone  following  receipt  of  a
      notice from the building owner or its authorized agent by certified mail
      that  he  or she objects to the installation, where such notice and copy
      to the Commissioner are sent  within  thirty  days  of  receipt  of  the
      commercial  lessee's consent. Nothing herein shall be construed to limit
      a building owner or its authorized agent from pursuing such remedies  as
      he  or  she  may  have  under  law  with  respect  to  the  unauthorized
      installation of a public pay telephone; and
        3. no  permit  shall  be  issued  or  renewed  for  the  installation,
      operation  and  maintenance  of  a  public pay telephone at any location
      where it will unreasonably interfere with the use of  a  street  by  the
      public,  or  where  it  will  unreasonably interfere with the use of the
      abutting property.
        b. The commissioner shall promulgate rules to implement the provisions
      of this chapter. Such rules shall include,  without  limitation:  (i)  a
      procedure  and  timetable  for  review  by  the  department,  and  other
      appropriate agencies, including the  department  of  transportation,  of
      applications for the issuance and renewal of permits to install, operate
      and   maintain  public  pay  telephones  at  specified  locations;  (ii)
      standards governing the location of public pay telephones designed so as
      to ensure that such telephones will not unreasonably interfere with  the
      use  of  the street by the public and with use of the abutting property;
      and (iii) standards and procedures governing the installation,  removal,
      operation,  cleaning and maintenance of public pay telephones, including
      procedures for  the  expedited  removal  of  any  public  pay  telephone
      determined to constitute a public nuisance.
    
        c.   Permits   may   contain  such  other  terms  and  conditions  not
      specifically provided for in this  chapter  as  the  commissioner  deems
      necessary to protect the public safety and to safeguard the interests of
      the city.

Section 23-404 ::    
        
     
        § 23-404 Term; Termination.
        a.  A  permit  for a public pay telephone shall continue in effect for
      the term of  the  franchise  held  by  the  owner  of  such  public  pay
      telephone,  unless  the  commissioner, after giving the permittee notice
      and an opportunity to be heard, determines: (i)  that  as  a  result  of
      changed  conditions, the public pay telephone unreasonably interferes or
      will unreasonably interfere with the use of a street by the  public,  or
      constitutes  a  public  nuisance; or (ii) that removal of the public pay
      telephone is required in connection with  a  street  widening  or  other
      capital project or for other purposes as may be specified by rule of the
      commissioner.  Upon  making  such  determination, the commissioner shall
      order the removal of the public pay telephone within a  reasonable  time
      period.  In  the  event  the  permittee  fails  to remove the public pay
      telephone  within  the  time  period  specified  in  such   order,   the
      commissioner may remove or cause the removal of the public pay telephone
      and  have  repair  and  restoration work performed at the expense of the
      permittee, who shall be liable in a civil action for the amount expended
      by the city.
        b. Notwithstanding the provisions of subdivision a of this section, in
      the event that a public pay telephone is removed in  connection  with  a
      street  widening or other capital project or other improvement specified
      by rule of the commissioner, the permittee may apply to the commissioner
      for permission to reinstall the public pay telephone at another location
      or, following the completion of such street widening,  capital  project,
      or  other  improvement,  at  or  near  its original location. Where such
      permission is granted, the permittee shall not be required to  obtain  a
      new  permit  for  the  public  pay  telephone, and the permit previously
      issued for such public pay telephone shall continue in effect.  If  such
      public  pay  telephone is reinstalled at another location, the permittee
      may apply to the commissioner for a new permit to install another public
      pay telephone following the completion of such street widening,  capital
      project  or  other  improvement  at or near the original location of the
      public  pay  telephone  previously  removed  in  connection   therewith,
      provided that the permittee has paid the required fee for such permit.

      telephone.

      sufficient  to  compensate  the  city  for the administrative expense of
      issuing or renewing a permit and the expense of  inspections  and  other

      distinct offense.
        c. An owner who violates any provision of this chapter, or any term or
      condition  of  a permit issued pursuant thereto, or any rule promulgated

      performance of related repair and restoration work.
        e. In addition to authorized officers and employees of the department,
      officers and employees of  the  department  of  transportation  who  are
      designated  by  the commissioner shall have the power to issue summonses

      violation   returnable   before  the  environmental  control  board  for
      violations of the provisions of this chapter.
        f. An owner of a public pay telephone shall be liable for a  violation
      by  his  or  her  employee,  agent  or  independent  contractor  of  the
      provisions of this chapter, or any term or condition of a permit  issued
      pursuant  thereto,  or any rule promulgated by the commissioner pursuant
      thereto, made in the course of performing his or her duties.
        g. An owner who submits an application  for  a  public  pay  telephone
      permit  containing  a certification made by a commercial lessee pursuant
      to subparagraph (iii) of paragraph 2 of subdivision a of section  23-403
      of  this  chapter,  knowing  that  such  certification  contains a false
      statement or false information, shall be guilty of a misdemeanor.
        h. The commissioner may request the corporation counsel  to  institute
      any  action  or  proceeding  that  may  be  appropriate  or necessary to
      restrain, correct or  abate  a  violation  of  the  provisions  of  this
      chapter.
        i.  1.  If  the  commissioner  has reasonable cause to believe that an
      owner, or any employee, agent or independent contractor of  such  owner,
      has violated the provisions of this chapter, or any term or condition of
      a  permit  issued  pursuant  thereto,  or  any  rule  promulgated by the
      commissioner pursuant thereto, the commissioner may (i) notify the owner
      of the condition identified by  the  commissioner  as  a  violation  and
      specify  the  action that must be taken to correct the condition in such
      manner and within such period of time as shall  be  set  forth  in  such
      notice,  and  (ii)  shall afford the owner an opportunity to contest the
    
      commissioner's notice in a manner to  be  set  forth  in  rules  of  the
      commissioner.  Upon  final determination by the commissioner and failure
      of such owner to correct the condition in  the  manner  and  within  the
      period  of time specified by the commissioner, the commissioner shall be
      authorized, at his or her discretion:
        aa. to remove or cause the removal of any public pay  telephone  which
      is  installed,  operated  or  maintained on, over or under any street or
      other unalienable property  of  the  city  without  a  permit  therefor.
      Notwithstanding the foregoing, notice shall be provided pursuant to this
      subdivision  prior  to  removal  only  where the name and address of the
      owner is shown on the public pay telephone or can be readily  identified
      by  the  commissioner  by virtue of a trademark prominently displayed on
      the public pay telephone;
        bb. to revoke a permit and, upon  revocation,  to  further  order  the
      removal of the public pay telephone. In the event the permittee fails to
      remove  the  public  pay  telephone  and  to  perform related repair and
      restoration work within the time period specified  by  such  order,  the
      commissioner may remove or cause the removal of the public pay telephone
      and  have  repair  and  restoration work performed at the expense of the
      permittee, who shall be liable for the amount expended by the city;
        cc. to render a public pay telephone inoperable except for the purpose
      of emergency telephone service through the 911 system  or  an  operator.
      Such  action  may continue until the violation has been corrected to the
      satisfaction of the commissioner and payment has been made of all  civil
      penalties  imposed for the violation and any fees for any administrative
      expense or expense of additional inspections incurred by the city  as  a
      result of such violation. The commissioner shall affix to any public pay
      phone  rendered  inoperable pursuant to this paragraph a notice advising
      the public that the phone may  be  used  only  for  emergency  telephone
      service  through  the  911  system  or an operator and setting forth the
      provisions of subdivision h of this section. Any device utilized by  the
      commissioner  for  the  purpose  of  rendering  a  public  pay telephone
      inoperable shall be designed so as to permit the unimpaired use  of  the
      public pay telephone upon the removal of the device;
        dd.  to suspend review of all applications for the issuance or renewal
      of permits filed by such owner pursuant to this chapter. Such suspension
      may continue until the violation has been corrected to the  satisfaction
      of  the  commissioner  and  payment  has been made of all fines or civil
      penalties imposed for the violation, any costs incurred by the city  for
      removal  and  related  repair  or restoration work, and any fees for any
      administrative expense or expense of additional inspections incurred  by
      the city as a result of such violation.
        2.   Notwithstanding   the   provisions   of  paragraph  one  of  this
      subdivision, if the commissioner determines that an imminent  threat  to
      life  or  property  exists,  the  commissioner  may  remove or cause the
      removal of a public pay telephone, and have repair and restoration  work
      performed  at  the  expense of the owner, without affording the owner an
      opportunity to be heard prior  to  such  removal.  An  owner  who  is  a
      permittee or whose name and address is shown on the public pay telephone
      shall  be provided notice and an opportunity to be heard five days after
      such removal in accordance with rules of the commissioner.
        3. The procedures set forth in this subdivision shall be  employed  by
      the  commissioner  in  addition  to or in lieu of the other remedies set
      forth in this section and shall not be construed to limit the  power  of
      the  commissioner  to  commence  a civil action or proceeding before the
      environmental control board, or to require that the commissioner  resort
      to  any procedure set forth in this subdivision as a prerequisite to the
      commencement of any such action or proceeding.
    
        j. It shall be a misdemeanor for any person: (i) to remove any  device
      installed  by  the commissioner pursuant to subparagraph aa of paragraph
      one of subdivision g of this section or to  otherwise  make  operable  a
      public  pay  telephone  upon  which such a device has been installed; or
      (ii)  to  remove  or deface any notice affixed to a public pay telephone
      pursuant to such paragraph of such subdivision. Such  misdemeanor  shall
      be  punishable  upon  conviction by a fine of not more than ten thousand
      dollars or imprisonment for not more than thirty days or both such  fine
      and imprisonment.
        k.  Any public pay telephone removed pursuant to this section which is
      not claimed by the owner within thirty days of removal shall  be  deemed
      to  be  abandoned.  All  abandoned  public pay telephones may be sold at
      public auction after having been advertised in the City Record  and  the
      proceeds  paid into the general fund or such abandoned telephones may be
      used or converted for use by the department or by another city agency. A
      public pay telephone shall be released to the owner upon payment of  the
      costs  of removal, repair and restoration work, and of storage, any fees
      for any administrative expense  or  expense  of  additional  inspections
      incurred  by  the  department  as  a  result of the violation, or, if an
      action or proceeding for the violation is pending in a court  or  before
      the  environmental  control  board,  upon the posting of a bond or other
      form of security acceptable to the commissioner in an amount which  will
      secure  the payment of such costs and any fines or civil penalties which
      may be imposed for the violation.
