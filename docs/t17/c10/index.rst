Section 17-1003 ::    
        
     
        §  17-1003  Prescription drug discount card program. a. The department
      shall develop a prescription drug discount card program which  shall  be
      made  available  to  all  New  York  city  residents, regardless of age,
      income, immigration status or health insurance coverage status, for  the
      purpose  of  providing  all  New York city residents with a prescription
      drug discount card which may  be  used  to  buy  prescription  drugs  at
      reduced  prices  at  participating  pharmacies.  Such  prescription drug
      discount card program shall enable each user of such program to purchase
      at a reduced price from a pharmacy that participates in the program  any
      prescription  drug that is eligible for a discount through such program.
      The prescription  drug  discount  card  program  shall  allow  users  to
      purchase  a drug at the lower of either the drug price available through
      the prescription drug discount card program or the pharmacy's  customary
      and  usual price. Any prescription drug discount card issued pursuant to
      this section may not be utilized in conjunction  with  another  type  of
      prescription drug discount card for the same transaction.
        b.  Nothing  in  this  chapter  shall  be  construed  to  provide  any
      governmental entity  other  than  the  department  with  access  to  any
      individually   identifiable   information   regarding   users   of   the
      prescription drug discount card program  established  pursuant  to  this
      section.   The   department  shall  keep  confidential  all  information
      concerning the identity of users of the program and the drugs that  such
      users  purchase  through  the  program.  The  department  may  use  such
      information  solely  to  conduct  epidemiological  and  health  planning
      studies and to provide general information to users about the drugs such
      users  are  taking,  the  conditions for which such users are taking the
      drugs and other services of the department  or  the  city  of  New  York
      related to such conditions.
        c.  No  administrator  of  the prescription drug discount card program
      shall provide the prescription drug discount card developed pursuant  to
      this  section  to  any  resident  of  the  city  of New York unless such
      administrator ensures that a portion of  any  rebate  payments  received
      from  drug  manufacturers  is  distributed  to  users  of  such program,
      including pharmacies participating in the program.
        d. Any duly licensed pharmacy willing to comply  with  the  terms  and
      conditions  of  the  prescription  drug  discount  card program shall be
      permitted to participate in the program.
