--------------

Section 17-330 ::    
        
     
        §  17-330  Regulations.  a.  The  commissioner, with the advice of the
      advisory  board  as  hereinafter  established,  shall  promulgate   such
      regulations  as  are  necessary  to  carry  out  the  provisions of this
      subchapter and to promote the health,  safety  and  well  being  of  the
      horses which are required to be licensed hereunder and of members of the
      public who hire such horses.
        b.  1.  Horses  shall not be left untethered or unattended except when
      confined in a stable or other enclosure. When tethered, all horses shall
      be secured by the use of a rope attached to the halter, not to  the  bit
      or bridle.
        2.  Horse  bridles and halters shall be used on carriage horses at all
      times when operating a carriage.
        c. Standing stalls for carriage horses shall be sixty square  feet  or

      horse or hung outside each stall at all times.
        d. Horses shall be adequately quartered. Stables and stalls  shall  be
      clean  and  dry  and  sufficient  bedding  of  straw,  shavings or other
      suitable materials shall be furnished and changed as often as  necessary
      to  maintain  them  in  a  clean and dry condition. Adequate heating and
      ventilation  shall  be  maintained  in  stables  as  prescribed  by  the
      commissioner.
        e.  Owners  shall  insure  that  appropriate  and  sufficient food and
      drinking water are available for each horse and that while working  each
      horse is permitted to eat and drink at reasonable intervals.
        f.  Owners  shall  not allow a horse to be worked on a public highway,
      path or street during adverse  weather  or  other  dangerous  conditions
      which  are  a threat to the health or safety of the horse. A horse being
      worked when such conditions develop shall be immediately returned to the
      stable by the most direct route.
        g. 1. Carriage horses shall not be at work for more than nine hours in
      any continuous twenty-four hour period. Riding horses shall  not  be  at
      work  for  more  than  eight  hours  in  any continuous twenty-four hour
      period. Rest periods for carriage horses and riding horses shall  be  of
      such duration and at such intervals as the commissioner shall prescribe,
      but  rest periods for carriage horses shall in no event be for less than
      fifteen minutes after each two hour working period, and the time of such
      rest period shall be included in calculating the  number  of  hours  the
      horse  has  worked  in  any  twenty-four  hour  period. During such rest
      periods, the person in charge of such carriage horses shall  make  fresh
      water available to the horse.
        2.  Carriage  horses shall receive no less than five weeks of vacation
      or furlough every twelve months at a horse stable facility which  allows
      daily  access  to  paddock or pasture turnout. Proof of such vacation or
      furlough shall be provided upon request to  the  department  and/or  the
      ASPCA.
        h.  Carriage  horses shall not be driven at a pace faster than a trot.
      Riding horses may be ridden at a canter but shall not be galloped.
        i. Horses shall be suitably trimmed or  shod,  and  saddles,  bridles,
      bits,  road harnesses and any other equipment used on or with a horse at
      work shall be maintained and properly fitted as prescribed by regulation
      of the commissioner.
        j. Stables in which horses used in a rental horse  business  are  kept

      employees  of  the  department,  and  any  persons  designated  by   the
      commissioner to enforce the provisions of this subchapter, agents of the
    
      ASPCA,  police  officers,  and  employees  of the department of consumer
      affairs.
        k. An owner shall be jointly liable with the person to whom a horse is
      rented  for  any  violation  of  this  subchapter  or of any regulations
      promulgated  hereunder  committed  by  such  person  if  the  owner  had
      knowledge  or  notice of the act which gave rise to the violation at the
      time of or prior to its occurrence or  under  the  circumstances  should
      have  had knowledge or notice of such act and did not attempt to prevent
      it from occurring.
        l. An owner of a rental horse business shall keep such records as  the
      commissioner  of  health  shall prescribe including but not limited to a
      consecutive daily  record  of  the  movements  of  each  licensed  horse
      including  the  driver's  name and identification number, if applicable,
      rider's name, the horse's identification number, vehicle  license  plate
      number,  if  applicable,  time  of  leaving stable and time of return to
      stable. An owner of a rental horse  business  shall  also  keep  written
      protocols  for  emergencies,  including  but  not limited to primary and
      secondary  emergency  contact  information  for  each  horse  owner  and
      insurance company information, if applicable. Such records shall be kept
      on  the  premises  of  the stable where the horses are kept and shall be
      available  for  inspection.  The  commissioner  may,  in  his   or   her
      discretion,  require  a  time clock, date stamp or time stamp where such
      commissioner believes it is appropriate.
        m. A horse required to be licensed pursuant to this  subchapter  which
      is  lame  or  suffers  from  a  physical  condition or illness making it
      unsuitable for work may be ordered  to  be  removed  from  work  by  the
      commissioner  or  his  or  her designee or by an agent of the ASPCA or a
      veterinarian employed or retained  by  such  commissioner  or  ASPCA  to
      inspect licensed horses. A horse for which such an order has been issued
      shall  not be returned to work until it has recovered from the condition
      which caused the issuance of the  order  or  until  such  condition  has
      improved  sufficiently  that  its  return to work will not aggravate the
      condition or  otherwise  endanger  the  health  of  the  horse.  In  any
      proceeding,  under  this section it shall be presumed that a horse which
      is found at work within forty-eight hours after the issuance of an order
      of removal and which is disabled by the same condition which caused such
      order to be issued has been  returned  to  work  in  violation  of  this
      section. Such presumption may be rebutted by offering a certificate of a
      veterinarian  indicating  suitability  to  return  to  work prior to the
      expiration of the forty-eight hour period.
        n. Every horse required to be licensed hereunder shall be examined  by
      a  veterinarian  prior to its use in a rental horse business, at time of
      each license renewal, and thereafter at intervals of not less than  four
      months  and not greater than eight months. The examination shall include
      the general physical condition of the horse, its teeth, hoofs and shoes,
      its stamina and physical ability to perform the work or duties  required
      of  it,  and  whether it is current on vaccinations, including those for
      rabies,  Eastern/Western   equine   encephalitis,   West   Nile   virus,
      Rhinopneumonitis  virus,  and  tetanus,  or  any  other vaccinations the
      Commissioner may require by rule. The examination shall also  include  a
      record   of   any   injury,  disease,  or  deficiency  observed  by  the
      veterinarian at the time,  together  with  any  prescription  or  humane
      correction  or  disposition  of the same. A signed health certificate by
      the examining veterinarian shall be maintained at the stable premises at
      which such horse is located and shall be displayed on the outside of the
      such horse's individual stall. An original of said certificate shall  be
      mailed by the examining veterinarian to the department.
    
        o. 1. Carriage horses shall not be worked whenever the air temperature
      is 18 degrees fahrenheit or below.
        2. Carriage horses shall not be worked whenever the air temperature is
      90 degrees fahrenheit or above.
        3.  For  purposes  of  this  subdivision,  temperatures shall be those
      measured  by  a  state-of-the-art  thermometer,  as  determined  by  the
      commissioner,  as measured by the commissioner or his or her designee at
      street level at one of the stands designated pursuant to section  19-174
      of the code.
        4.  If  the  temperature  exceeds  the  limits set by this subdivision
      during the course of a particular ride, at the ride's conclusion, but no
      later than one-half hour after the temperature exceeds these limits, the
      operator must immediately cease working, move the horse to  an  area  of
      shelter,  where  available,  rest the horse and then walk it directly to
      its stable. All horses so returned to their stable must be unbridled and
      unharnessed and remain  at  the  stable  for  at  least  one  hour,  and
      thereafter,  until  such time as the weather conditions shall once again
      reach acceptable limits.
        5. No violation of this  subdivision  shall  occur  unless  a  written
      warning  of  violation  is  first  issued  by the authorized enforcement
      personnel to the operator advising that the air  temperature  limits  of
      this  subdivision  have  been  exceeded  and directing that the operator
      cease working a carriage horse in accordance with the provisions of this
      subdivision. A violation  of  this  subdivision  may  be  issued  if  an
      operator  fails  to  comply  with the direction contained in the written
      warning of violation. Failure to comply with such direction shall not be
      construed as a separate violation.
        p. Every carriage horse required to be  licensed  hereunder  shall  be
      equipped with a manure catching device. Such devices shall be affixed or
      attached  to the carriage and shall at no time be affixed or attached to
      the horse.
        q. Carriage horses shall not be younger than five years  at  the  time
      placed  into  service  in  any  rental  horse  business and licensed. No
      carriage horse older than 26 years of age shall be licensed to work in a
      rental horse business. Acceptable proof of age shall  include  a  signed
      letter   from  a  licensed  veterinarian  stating  the  horse's  age,  a
      certificate from an officially recognized national  registry  of  horses
      stating  the  horse's  age,  or  another  industry  approved  method  of
      certifying age.
        r. Owners shall insure that during  the  months  of  November  through
      April every carriage is equipped with a heavy winter horse blanket large
      enough  to  cover  the  horse  from  crest  of neck to top of rump. Such
      blankets shall be  used  to  cover  carriage  horses  in  cold  weather.
      Waterproof horse blankets of a lighter material shall be provided at all
      times  to  cover  the  horse  from withers to tail during periods of wet
      weather when the air temperature is 55 degrees or below.
