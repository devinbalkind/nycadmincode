Section 17-357
--------------

Section 17-357 ::    
        
     
        §  17-357  Licenses.  a.  No  person  shall  engage in the practice of
      tattooing without having obtained a license to engage in  such  practice
      in the manner prescribed in this subchapter.
        b.  The  provisions  of this subchapter shall not apply to a physician
      licensed under article one hundred thirty-one  of  the  New  York  state
      education law.
        c.  Notwithstanding  the  requirements  set forth in this section, the
      commissioner may issue a seven-day temporary license to a person holding
      a license or similar certification or  registration  to  engage  in  the
      practice of tattooing issued under the jurisdiction of another political
      subdivision, state or nation. Such temporary license will allow a person
      to  apply  tattoos  within  the  city  of  New  York  under  the  direct
      supervision of a tattooist holding a license issued  by  the  department
      pursuant to subdivision a of this section. Where an applicant for such a
      seven-day  temporary  license practices tattooing in a jurisdiction that
      does not license or otherwise register tattooists, the commissioner  may
      issue   such  seven-day  temporary  license  to  such  person  upon  the
      presentation  of  proof  satisfactory  to  the  commissioner  that   the
      applicant   has  received  training  equivalent  to  that  necessary  to
      satisfactorily pass the examination required in section 17-358. The  fee
      for  such temporary license shall be established in rules promulgated by
      the commissioner.

      person intending to engage in the practice of tattooing shall  apply  to
      the commissioner for a tattoo license, in the form and manner prescribed
      by  the commissioner. Such application shall contain such information as
      the  commissioner  deems  reasonable  and  necessary  to  determine  the
      qualifications  for granting a license to the applicant. The application
      shall be subscribed by the  applicant  and  affirmed  under  penalty  of
      perjury.
        b.  Any  person  eighteen  years  of  age  or  older  may apply to the

      minor in violation of section 260.21 of the New  York  state  penal  law
      within the year immediately preceding such license application.
        c.  Each  applicant  for  a  tattoo  license shall take an examination
      administered by the department in accordance with rules  promulgated  by
      the   commissioner   regarding  health  issues  relating  to  tattooing,
      including  but  not  limited  to,  infection  control,  utilization   of
      universal  precautions as recommended by the federal centers for disease
      control and prevention and proper methods of waste disposal. The fee for
      such examination shall be established pursuant to rules  promulgated  by
      the   commissioner.   An  application  for  a  tattoo  license  must  be
      accompanied by satisfactory evidence of passing  such  examination.  The
      commissioner  shall issue an informational publication which may be used
      by  applicants  for  a  tattoo  license  in  preparing  to   take   such
      examination.   The   commissioner   shall   update   such  informational
      publication when the commissioner  determines  that  new  health-related
      information or techniques have become available.
        d. The biennial fee for a tattoo license shall be one hundred dollars.

      "LICENSED  BY THE NEW YORK CITY DEPARTMENT OF HEALTH AND MENTAL HYGIENE"
      and the license number of  such  licensee.  For  the  purposes  of  this
      subdivision,  an alphabetical listing in a telephone directory shall not
      be considered advertising.
