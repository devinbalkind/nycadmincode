Chapter 4 - STANDARDS GOVERNING THE PERFORMANCE OF STERILIZATIONS
=================================================================

Section 17-401

Section 17-401 ::    
        
     
        §  17-401  Findings  and declaration. The council declares that due to
      the irreversible nature of the sterilization procedure, it is  essential
      that   the   patient   fully   comprehends   the  effects  and  possible
      complications of the operation. The patient  should  have  a  reasonable
      time to consider his or her decision and possible alternative methods of
      contraception  before the operation is performed. Since it is within the
      purview of the public policy  of  the  city  to  preserve,  protect  and
      improve the public health, safety and welfare, it is imperative that the
      council establish standards governing the performance of sterilizations.

--------------

Section 17-404 ::    
        
     
        §  17-404  Waiting period. A sterilization may not be performed sooner
      than thirty days following the initial informed  consent  given  by  the
      patient  unless  the  patient waives the thirty-day waiting period under
      the following circumstances:
        1. A patient who has completed the appropriate forms and informational
      session, and who has signed the required informed consent form at  least
      thirty days prior to her anticipated delivery date, may be sterilized in
      less  than  thirty  days,  but  in  no  case less than seventy-two hours
      following the initial informed consent given  by  such  patient  if  she
      delivers  prior  to  the  anticipated  date  and  the  sterilization  is
      performed at the time of delivery.
        2. A patient who has completed the appropriate forms and informational
      session and who signs the required consent form  at  least  thirty  days
      prior  to  the  anticipated sterilization may be sterilized in less than
      thirty days if that patient is, within the thirty-day  period,  admitted
      to  a  facility for emergency abdominal surgery and the sterilization is
      concurrent with  the  abdominal  surgery,  but  in  no  case  shall  the
      sterilization  occur  less  than  seventy-two  hours  after  the initial
      consent.
        3. If a patient appears for delivery or emergency abdominal surgery at
      a facility other than that  at  which  the  patient  has  completed  the
      appropriate  forms  and  informational  session,  the receiving facility
      shall contact, by  telephone,  the  facility  at  which  the  forms  and
      procedures  were  completed for verification of same. This must be noted
      in the record, with the name and  title  of  the  person  providing  the
      information,  the  date  that  the  consent  form  was  signed  and  the
      anticipated delivery date if under subdivision one of  this  section  or
      sterilization  date  if  under subdivision two of this section. If it is
      verified that the consent form was signed at least thirty days prior  to
      the  anticipated  delivery or sterilization date, the receiving facility
      may perform the sterilization operation. Telephone verification may  not
      be  waived  unless  the patient presents a duplicate copy of the initial
      consent, duly signed, witnessed and dated at least thirty days prior  to
      the anticipated delivery or sterilization date.

        1.  Initial  consent  may not be elicited from a female patient during
      admission or hospitalization for childbirth or abortion.

      services  or  benefits  will  not  be  lost  as  a  result  of  refusing
      sterilization.

      during the thirty-day waiting period.
        7.  Consent for the sterilization may be revoked any time prior to the
