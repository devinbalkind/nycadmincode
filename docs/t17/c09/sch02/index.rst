      January 1, 1978, shall be presumed to be lead-based paint.
        b.  The presumption established by this section may be rebutted by the
      operator or owner  of  the  day  care  facility  by  submitting  to  the
      department a sworn written statement by the operator or owner of the day
      care facility supported by lead-based paint testing or sampling results,

      performed by an employee or agent of the operator or owner  of  the  day
      care  facility,  and  such  other  proof  as the department may require.
      Testing performed to rebut the presumption may only be  performed  by  a

      accordance with subparts L and Q of part 745 of title 40 of the code  of
