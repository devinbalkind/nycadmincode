      Whenever the board of health, by  public  notice,  shall  designate  any
      portion  or  district of the city as being the seat of any infectious or
      contagious disease, and  declare  communication  with  such  portion  or

      clerk,  during  the  continuance of such disease in such district, shall
      provide and keep in his  or  her  office  a  book  for  the  purpose  of
      registering  in  alphabetical  order,  the  names,  firms  and places of
      business of any inhabitant of the city who shall request  such  registry
      to be made.
        b.  All  persons  and  firms usually resident or doing business within
      such infected district shall register, in the books so  provided,  their
      names  or firms, with the place or places out of such infected district,
      but within the city to which they may have removed  the  transaction  of
      their  business,  or  to which they may desire any notices to be sent or
      served, or any notes, drafts, or bills to be presented for acceptance or
      for payment. Twenty-five cents may be claimed and received by  the  city
      clerk  for  every such registry; but the book in which the same shall be
      entered shall be open to public examination free of all charges  at  all
      times during office hours.
        c.  During  the  continuance  of  any  such  disease  in such infected
      district, all drafts, notes and bills, which by law are required  to  be
      presented  for  acceptance  or  for  payment,  may be presented for such
      purpose at the place so designated in such registry, and all notices  of
      non-acceptance and non-payment of any note, draft or bill, or of protest
      for  such  non-acceptance  or  non-payment, may be served by leaving the
      same at the place so designated.
        d. In case any person or  firm  usually  resident  or  doing  business
      within  such  infected  district  shall  neglect to make and cause to be
      entered in the book so  provided,  the  registry  herein  required,  all
      notes, drafts or bills which by law are required to be presented to such
      person  or  firm  for acceptance or for payment, may be presented to the
      city clerk during the continuance of such disease, at  any  time  during
      office hours, and demand of acceptance or payment thereof may be made of
      such  city clerk, to the same purpose and with the same effect as if the
      same had been presented and  acceptance  or  payment  demanded  of  such
      person or firm at their usual place of doing business.
        e.  In  case  of  omission  to  make the registry herein required, all
      notices of the non-acceptance or non-payment  of  any  note,  draft,  or
      bill,  or  of  protest  for  such  non-acceptance or non-payment, may be
      served on any person or firm usually resident or doing  business  within
      such  infected  district, by leaving the same at one of the post-offices
      in the city.  Such service shall be as valid and  effectual  as  if  the
      notices had been served personally on such person or one of such firm at
      his, her or their usual place of doing business.
        f. Whenever proclamation shall be made by the board of health, that an
      infectious  or contagious disease in any infected district has subsided,

        §  17-147  Execution.  If  such  order is not complied with, or so far
      complied with as the board may regard as reasonable,  within  five  days
      after service or attempted service or within any shorter time, which, in
      case  of  imminent  peril  to  the  public  health,  the  board may have
      designated, or is not thereafter speedily and fully executed, then  such
      order  may  be executed as any of the orders of the board or department.
      Any agency of the city is authorized to act as agent of  the  department
      in  executing  such order. In the event that any agency shall so act, it
      shall certify and  transmit  to  the  department  its  expenses  in  the
      execution  of  such order separately in respect of each separately owned
      parcel of property. Such expenses shall be reimbursed to such agency and
      shall be chargeable and collectible as expenses  of  the  department  in
      connection  with  the  execution  of  an  order  as  referred to in this
      chapter.

Section 17-148 ::    
        
     
        §  17-148  Substituted service; posting; service by publication. a. If
      personal service of any such order cannot be made by reason  of  absence
      from  the  district,  or  inability  to  find one or more of the owners,
      occupants, lessees or tenants of the subject matter to which such  order
      relates,  or  one  or more of the persons whose duty it was to have done
      what is therein required to be done, as the case  may  render  just  and
      proper  in  the  opinion  of  the  board,  to  be  shown by the official
      certificates of the officer having such order to serve, then service may
      be made through the mail, or by copy left at the residence or  place  of
      business  of  the  person sought to be served, with a person of suitable
      age and discretion.
        b. In any case where personal service of any such order cannot be made
      for the reasons stated in subdivision a  of  this  section  and  service
      cannot  be  made  as provided in such subdivision through the mail or by
      leaving a copy with a person of suitable age and discretion, because  of
      inability  to  obtain  the  name  or  address of the person sought to be
      served, and such inability to effect service is shown  by  the  official
      certificate  of  the  officer having such order to serve, service may be
      made by conspicuously posting a copy of such order upon the property  to
      which  it  relates. The posting of such order shall be sufficient notice
      of such order and of the  nuisance  therein  mentioned  to  all  persons
      having any duty or liability in relation thereto under the provisions of
      this chapter.
        c.  Whenever  the  board  shall have declared any condition, matter or
      thing to be a nuisance, including ragweed or any other species of  weed,
      plant  or growth, and has entered the same in its records as a nuisance,
      the board may also take and file among its records what it shall  regard
      as  sufficient  proof  to  authorize a declaration that such nuisance is
      widespread throughout the city or in any area thereof, and that personal
      service or service pursuant to subdivision a or b of this section of  an
      order  or  orders requiring the abatement, removal or correction of such
      nuisance would result in delay prejudicial to the public health, welfare
      or safety, and upon the filing of such proof  and  the  making  of  such
      declaration,  the  board may order that such nuisance be removed, abated
      or corrected,  as  prescribed  by  the  board,  by  an  order  addressed
      generally,  without  specification of names or addresses, to all persons
      who, pursuant to the provisions  of  this  chapter,  have  any  duty  or
      liability  in  relation  to any such nuisance which may exist upon or in
      any real or personal property or place located within the area or  areas
      specified in such order. Such order may be served by publishing the same
      for  a  period  of  not less than three days in the City Record and in a
      newspaper circulated in the area  or  areas  mentioned  in  such  order.
      Service  of  such order shall be complete at the expiration of the third
      day of such publication and such publication shall be sufficient  notice
      of  such  order  and  of  the  nuisance therein mentioned to all persons
      having any duty or liability in relation thereto under the provisions of
      this chapter.

      owners or part owners and each of  the  lessees  and  occupants  of  the
      building, business, place, property, matter or thing to which such order
      relates,  and  in respect to which such expenses were incurred; and also
      against every person or body who was by law or contract bound to do that
      in regard to such business, place, street,  property,  matter  or  thing
      which  such  order  requires.  Such expenses shall also be a lien on all
      rent and compensation due, or to grow due, for the  use  of  any  place,
      room,  building,  premises, matter or thing to which such order relates,
      and in respect of which such expenses were incurred, and also a lien  on
      all  compensation  due,  or to grow due, for the cleaning of any street,
      place, ground, or thing, or for the cleaning, or removal, of any matter,
      thing, or place, the failure to do which by the party bound so to do, or
      doing of the same in whole or in part by order of such  department,  was
      the cause or occasion of any such order or expense.

      the  rules  of  the department may provide, may institute and maintain a
      suit against any one liable for such expenses, or  against  any  person,
      firm,  or  corporation,  owing or who may owe such rent or compensation,
      and may recover the expenses so incurred under any such  order.  One  or
      more  of  such  parties liable or interested may be made parties to such
      action as the department may elect; but  the  parties  made  responsible
      herein  for  such  expenses  shall  be  liable  to contribute or to make
      payment as between themselves, in respect of such expenses, and  of  any
      sum recovered for such expenses or compensation, or by any party paid on
      account thereof, according to the legal or equitable obligation existing
      between them.
    
    
    
    
    
    
    

Section 17-151
--------------

Section 17-151 ::    
        
     
        §  17-151  Lien  on premises. a. There shall be filed in the office of
      the department a record of all work caused to  be  performed  by  or  on
      behalf  of  the  department  in  executing  any  order  of  the board or
      department.  Such records shall be kept on a building by building  basis
      and  shall  be  accessible  to  the public during business hours. Within
      thirty days after the issuance of a purchase or work order to cause such
      work to be done, entry of such order shall be made on the records of the
      department. Such entry shall constitute notice to all parties.
        b. All expenses incurred by or on behalf of the  department  for  such
      work,  pursuant  to this title or any other applicable provision of law,
      shall constitute a lien upon the land and buildings upon or  in  respect
      to  which,  or either of which, the work required by such order has been
      done, or expenses incurred, when the  amount  thereof  shall  have  been
      definitely  computed as a statement of account by the department and the
      department shall cause to be filed in the office of the  city  collector
      an entry of the account stated in the book in which such charges against
      the premises are to be entered. Such lien shall have a priority over all
      other   liens  and  encumbrances  except  for  the  lien  of  taxes  and
      assessments. However, no lien created pursuant to this  title  shall  be
      enforced  against  a  subsequent purchaser in good faith or mortgagee in
      good faith unless the requirements of subdivision a of this section  are
      satisfied;  this  limitation  shall only apply to transactions occurring
      after the  date  such  record  should  have  been  entered  pursuant  to
      subdivision a and before the date such entry was made.
        c.  A  notice  thereof,  stating  the amount due and the nature of the
      charge, shall be mailed by the city collector, within  five  days  after
      such  entry,  to the last known address of the person whose name appears
      on the records in the office of the city collector as being the owner or
      agent or as the person designated by the owner to receive tax bills  or,
      where no name appears, to the premises, addressed to either the owner or
      the agent.
        d.  If  such  charge  is  not paid within thirty days from the date of
      entry, it shall be the duty of the city collector  to  receive  interest
      thereon  at  the  rate  of  interest  applicable  to such property for a
      delinquent tax on real property, to be calculated to the date of payment
      from the date of entry.
        e. Such charge and the interest thereon shall continue  to  be,  until
      paid,  a  lien on the premises. Such lien shall be a tax lien within the
      meaning of sections 11-319 and 11-401 of  the  code  and  may  be  sold,
      enforced or foreclosed in the manner provided in chapters three and four
      of  title  eleven of the code or may be satisfied in accordance with the
      provisions of section thirteen hundred fifty-four of the  real  property
      actions and proceedings law.
        f.  Such  notice mailed by the city collector pursuant to this section
      shall have stamped or printed thereon a reference to this section of the
      code.

Section 17-152 ::    
        
     
        §   17-152  Validity  of  lien;  grounds  for  challenge.  a.  In  any
      proceedings to enforce or discharge the lien, the validity of  the  lien
      shall not be subject to challenge based on:
        (1) The lawfulness of the work done; or
        (2)  The  propriety  and accuracy of the items of expenses for which a
      lien is claimed, except as provided in this section.
        b. No such challenge may be made  except  by  (1)  the  owner  of  the
      property, or (2) a mortgagee or lienor whose mortgage or lien would, but
      for the provision of section 17-151, have priority over the department's
      lien.
        c.  With  respect  to  any  issue  specified  in subdivision a of this
      section the certificate of the  department  filed  pursuant  to  section

      department shall have executed, or so far executed as the department may
      require, any order, a certificate setting forth  the  expenses  of  such
      execution, itemized generally, and the date thereof shall be filed among
      the  records  of  the  department  with  the  order so executed; and the
      department shall take care  by,  or  through  some  proper  officer,  or
      otherwise,  that  the  expenses  of  such  execution  be  so stated with
      fairness and accuracy.
        b. When it shall appear that such execution or the  expenses  thereof,
      related  to  several  lots  or buildings belonging to different persons,
      such certificate shall state what belongs to, or  arose  in  respect  to
      each  lot  of  such  several lots or buildings, as the department or its
      authorized officer  may  direct;  and  the  department  may  revise  the
      correctness  of  such apportionment of expenses as truth and justice may
      require.
        c. Whenever the expenses attending the execution of any order  of  the
      department  may be made the subject of a suit by it, there may be joined
      in the same suit a claim or claims for  any  penalty  or  penalties  for
      violation  of any health provisions, or for the violation or omission to
      perform or obey such order, or any prior order of the department, or for
      the not doing of that, or any portion of that, for the  doing  of  which
      such  expenses  arose  or were incurred; and the proper joint or several
      judgment may be had against one or more of the defendants in  the  suit,
      as  they or either of them may be liable in respect of both such claims,
      or either or any of them.

      the  department  that  any  building  or any part thereof in the city is
      infected with communicable disease, or by reason of want of  repair  has
      become  dangerous  to  life  or is unfit for human habitation because of
      defects in drainage, plumbing, ventilation, or the construction  of  the
      same, or because of the existence of a nuisance on the premises which is
      likely  to  cause sickness among its occupants, the department may issue

      posted  and  mailed,  or  within  such  shorter  time,  not  less   than
      twenty-four  hours, as in such order may be specified, shall be vacated,
      but the department whenever it shall become satisfied  that  the  danger
      from  such  building  or  part thereof has ceased to exist, or that such
      building has been repaired so as to be habitable, may revoke such order.

      thereof in the city, in the opinion of the department, by reason of:
        1. Age, or
        2. Defects in drainage, plumbing or ventilation, or
        3. Infection with communicable disease, or
        4. The existence of a nuisance on the premises,  which  is  likely  to
      cause  sickness  among  its  occupants,  or among the occupants of other
      property in such city, or
        5. Its stopping ventilation in other buildings, or otherwise making or
      conducing to make them unfit  for  human  habitation,  or  dangerous  or
      injurious to health, or
        6.  Its  preventing proper measures from being taken for remedying any
      nuisance injurious to health, or
        7. Other sanitary evils in respect of  such  other  buildings,  is  so
      unfit  for  human  habitation  that  the  evils  in,  or  caused by such
      building, can not be remedied by repairs  or  otherwise  except  by  the
      destruction of such building or a portion thereof, the department having
      first made an order to vacate such building, if it deem such course just
      and  proper,  may  condemn the same and order it removed. The department
      may institute proceedings in the supreme  court  in  the  city  for  the
      condemnation  of  such  building,  provided,  however, that the owner or
      owners of such building may demand that it be  surveyed  in  the  manner
      provided for in case of unsafe buildings.

      statement of the reasons therefor, and shall not be required to  contain
      further  allegations  of  facts  than  those  which  have  actuated  the
      department in this proceeding, which shall then be  carried  on  in  the
      manner  prescribed for a capital project proceeding by subchapter one of
      chapter three of title five of the code. The owner of such  building  or
      any  person  interested  therein  may  in  his or her answer dispute the
      necessity of the destruction of such building or part  thereof,  as  the
      case  may  be. In such case, the court shall not take steps to ascertain
      the value of the property unless proof is made of the necessity of  such
      destruction.

      being  used  for  illegal  purposes,  or  being  so overcrowded as to be
      dangerous or injurious to the health of the inmates; or
        2. That the building is in a state of defective sanitation, or is  not

      products, both on and off-site of the generating facility; and
        8. all relevant federal, state and local legislation and regulations.

      certificates, may be transmitted to the department. The department shall
      ensure that the electronic death registration system be designed in such
      a  way so as to best facilitate convenient access by responsible persons
      in a manner consistent with ensuring system security.
        c. Implementation. (i) By October 1, 2006, the department shall ensure
      that at least sixty percent of all deaths occurring within the  city  of
      New  York  are  registered via the electronic death registration system.
      (ii) By October 1, 2008, the department shall ensure that the electronic
      death registration system is accessible to all responsible  persons  who
      seek  to use such system for the registration of deaths occurring within
      the city of New York and that  at  least  seventy-five  percent  of  all
      deaths  occurring  within  the  city of New York are registered via such
      system.
        d. Emergency events; exceptions. In the event of an emergency declared
      by the commissioner or the mayor, or exigent circumstances  declared  by
      the  commissioner or chief medical examiner on a case-by-case basis, the
      electronic death registration system shall not be required as the  means
      for the registration of deaths.
        e.  Training  and  certification.  By  October 1, 2004, the department
      shall develop a training curriculum and  implement  a  training  program
      based  on  such  curriculum  to  train all responsible persons and their
      designees pursuant to subdivision f of this section in the operation and
      use of the electronic death registration system.  The  department  shall
      ensure  that such training program be offered at least four times a year
      at various locations  throughout  the  city  of  New  York  at  a  price
      reasonably related to the cost of providing such training. Such programs
      may be operated by the department or by a private entity, including, but
      not  limited  to,  health  care  facilities  and  relevant  professional
      associations  and  societies,  pursuant  to  an   agreement   with   the
      department.   At  the  successful  completion  of  such  training,  such
      responsible persons and their designees shall  receive  a  certification
      from  the  department  indicating  that  such  training was successfully
      completed.
        f. Access.  (i)  A  responsible  person  may  designate  one  or  more
      employees  of  such  responsible  person  to  input information into the
      electronic death registration  system  under  the  supervision  of  such
    
      responsible  person,  but  who  are  not authorized to authenticate such
      information.  (ii) By November 1, 2004, the department shall provide  at
      least  two  computer  workstations  at  all burial desks operated by the
      office  of  vital statistics for the use of responsible persons to input
      information into the electronic death registration system.
        g.  Violations.  Any  responsible  person  who  violates   any   rules
      promulgated pursuant to this section shall be liable to pay a penalty as
      provided  by the health code of the city of New York, the administrative
      code of the city of New York  or  any  other  applicable  law,  rule  or
      regulation.
        h.  Advisory panel. Not later than sixty days after the effective date
      of the local law that added this section,  there  shall  be  established
      within  the  department  an advisory panel to advise the commissioner on

      of the commissioner or his or her designee, the chief  medical  examiner
      or  his  or  her designee and at least eight additional members, four of
      whom shall be appointed by the mayor and four of whom shall be appointed
      by the speaker  of  the  city  council.  With  respect  to  the  mayor's
      appointments,  one  shall  represent  the interests of private hospitals
      operating within the city, one shall represent the interests  of  public
      hospitals  operating  within  the  city  and  two  shall  represent  the
      interests of funeral directors operating within the city.  With  respect
      to  the  appointments  by  the  speaker  of  the city council, one shall
      represent the interests of private hospitals operating within the  city,
      one  shall  represent the interests of public hospitals operating within
      the city and two shall represent  the  interests  of  funeral  directors
      operating within the city. All members of the advisory panel shall serve
      without  compensation.  The  commissioner  or  his or her designee shall
      serve as the chair of such advisory panel. The advisory panel  shall  be
      convened at least four times each year and shall be disbanded on October
      1, 2009.
        i.  Report.  Not later than six months after the effective date of the
      local law that added this section, and every six months thereafter,  the
      department  shall submit a report to the mayor and the council reviewing
      the development and implementation of the electronic death  registration
      system.
        j.  Rules.  By November 1, 2004, the department shall promulgate rules
      in accordance with  this  section,  and  such  other  rules  as  may  be
      necessary   for  the  purpose  of  implementing  and  carrying  out  the
      provisions of this section. Such rules shall include a schedule of  fees
      relating  to  the  issuance  of permits and certified death certificates

Section 17-197 ::    
        
     
        §  17-197 Restraining animals outdoors. a. (1) No person shall tether,
      leash, fasten, secure, restrain, chain or tie an animal to a  stationary
      object  outdoors,  or  cause such animal to be so restrained, for longer
      than three continuous hours in any continuous  twelve-hour  period.  (2)
      Any  person who tethers, leashes, fastens, secures, restrains, chains or
      ties an animal to a stationary object outdoors for a permissible  period
      of time shall provide such animal with adequate food, water and shelter,
      and  shall restrain the animal with a device having swivels at both ends
      that is of an adequate length for the type  and  size  of  animal  being
      restrained,  provided, however, that the requirement to provide adequate
      food, water and shelter shall not apply to a  person  who  restrains  an
      animal  while  completing  a  task  for a period of time that is fifteen
      minutes or less in duration.
        b. Notwithstanding the provisions of subdivision a of this section, no
      person shall tether, leash, fasten, chain, tie, secure or  restrain  any
      animal for any amount of time with a device that:
        (1) is a choke collar or pinch collar;
        (2)  has  weights  attached  or  contains  links  that  are  more than
      one-quarter inch thick;
        (3) because of its design or placement is likely to become entangled;
        (4) is long enough to allow the animal to move outside of its  owner's
      property; and
        (5)  would  allow the restrained animal to move over an object or edge
      that could result in the strangulation of or injury to such animal.
        c. Any person who violates the provisions of this section  or  any  of
      the  rules  promulgated thereunder shall, for a first offense, be guilty
      of a violation punishable by a fine not  to  exceed  two  hundred  fifty
      dollars,  provided  that  such  person shall be issued a written warning
      instead of such fine for such first offense where such  animal  was  not
      injured  as  a  result of being restrained in violation of this section.
      For any subsequent offense within a continuous twelve-month period, such
      person shall be guilty of a class B misdemeanor punishable by a fine not
      to exceed five hundred dollars or by imprisonment of not more than three
      months, or both. In addition to such penalties, any person who  violates

      including, but not  limited  to,  time-stamped  photographs  and  video,
      records of complaints, and sworn witness statements.
        e.  The  provisions of this section shall not be construed to prohibit
      the department, the American Society for the Prevention  of  Cruelty  to
      Animals  or  any  law  enforcement officer from enforcing any other law,
      rule or regulation regarding the humane treatment of animals.
        f. The provisions of subdivision (a) of this section shall  not  apply
      to  the  officers  or  employees  of  any  federal,  state  or  city law
      enforcement agency.
