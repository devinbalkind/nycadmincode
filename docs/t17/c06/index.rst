Section 17-609
--------------

Section 17-609 ::    
        
     
        §  17-609  Drug  testing  procedures.  a.  All drug tests administered
      pursuant to this chapter shall  utilize  those  reliable  screening  and
      confirmatory  procedures  set forth in rules promulgated by the board of
      education which are at  least  as  reliable  as  the  enzyme  multiplied
      immunoassay  screening test and the gas chromatography/mass spectrometry
      confirmatory test.
        b. If a sample yields a positive test result, another sample from  the
      same  specimen  shall  be re-tested using a test at least as reliable as
      the gas chromatography/mass spectrometry test. Such a confirmatory  test
      shall  use  a  portion  of  the  same  test  specimen collected from the
      employee for use in the first test. If such confirmatory test  yields  a
      positive  test  result the driver may, at his or her option and expense,
      have an additional test conducted on a sample from the same specimen  by
      any  laboratory  eligible  to  conduct  drug  testing under this chapter
      within thirty days of the administration of the original test.
        c. (1) All test results shall be interpreted and verified by a medical
      review officer employed by the motor carrier. The medical review officer
      shall  be  a  licensed  physician  with  knowledge  of  substance  abuse
      disorders  and appropriate medical training to interpret and evaluate an
      individual's test result together with his  or  her  individual  medical
      history and any other relevant biomedical information.
        (2)  The  medical  review officer shall (i) receive the results of all
      drug tests from the laboratory; (ii) verify that the  laboratory  report
      and  assessment  of  all  drug  test  results are reliable and treat the
      results as confidential until such verification is made; (iii) determine
      whether an individual passes a drug test; (iv) promptly report all  test
      results  to  the  driver  in writing; (v) report each test that does not
      pass to the individual whom the motor carrier has designated to  receive
      the  results  and the chancellor of the board of education or his or her
      designee; (vi) recommend to the  motor  carrier  whether  a  driver  who
      refused  to  take  or  did  not pass a drug test administered under this
      chapter and who passes a subsequent  return  to  active  duty  test  may
      return to active duty; and (vii) maintain records of all recommendations
      to  the  motor  carrier concerning removal from or return to active duty
      and in cases where rehabilitation is not recommended after  a  confirmed
      positive  test  result,  the  reasons  for  such recommendation shall be
      submitted to the chancellor of the board of  education  or  his  or  her
      designee.
        (3)  When reviewing positive results of a confirmatory test under this
      section, the  medical  review  officer  may  consider  the  individual's
      medical   history,   including   any   medical  records  and  biomedical
      information provided, in  determining  whether  there  is  a  legitimate
      medical  explanation  for  the  result,  including  the use of a legally
      prescribed medication.
        (4) A driver may submit a list of any legally prescribed medication he
      or  she  is  using  to  the  medical  review  officer   prior   to   the
      administration of a drug test.
        d.  (1) The board of education, in consultation with the department of
      health and mental hygiene, shall promulgate rules, which to  the  extent
      practicable are consistent with the procedures established by the United
      States  department  of  transportation,  to implement this chapter. Such
      rules shall include initial cutoff levels  to  be  used  when  screening
      urine  specimens  to  determine  whether  they test positive for illegal
      drugs, chain of custody procedures to account for the integrity of  each
      urine  specimen  by  tracking  its  handling  and  storage from point of
      specimen  collection   to   final   disposition,   specimen   collection
      procedures,  quality  assurance and quality control programs, procedures
    
      governing the reporting and review of test  results  and  procedures  to
      safeguard the confidentiality of drivers.
        (2)  The  board of education shall provide motor carriers with written
      guidelines and procedures for the implementation  of  the  drug  testing
      program  pursuant  to  this  chapter no later than the effective date of
      this local law.
        e. Motor carriers  subject  to  this  chapter  shall  use  only  those
      laboratories  certified under the United States department of health and
      human services mandatory guidelines for federal workplace  drug  testing
      programs  or  approved  by  the  New York state department of health, to
      execute the drug testing program required by this chapter.
        f. Laboratories employed by motor carriers to execute the drug testing
      program pursuant to this chapter shall report drug test results  to  the
      medical review officer in writing within five days after a drug test has
      been  administered.  All  drug  test specimens shall be retained by such
      laboratories for at least six months.
        g. Two or more motor carriers may join together  for  the  purpose  of
      employing  a  medical  review officer and/or a laboratory to comply with
      the requirements of this chapter. Notwithstanding  the  foregoing,  each
      motor  carrier  shall be individually responsible for complying with the
      provisions of this chapter.

      pursuant  to this chapter shall immediately be removed from active duty.
      The  medical  review   officer   may,   where   appropriate,   recommend
      rehabilitation  or  other  treatment programs. No driver shall return to
      active duty unless he or she submits proof of successful completion of a
      rehabilitation program or  other  recommended  treatment  and  passes  a
      return to active duty drug test as required by section 17-608.
        b.  Any  driver who does not pass a drug test shall receive within ten
      days of the confirmatory test, together with written notification of his
      or her test result, written notice of the right to undergo an additional
      drug test performed on a sample of the same  specimen,  at  his  or  her
      option  and  expense, within thirty days after the administration of the
      original drug test.
        c. Any driver who refuses to take a drug  test  shall  immediately  be
      removed from active duty for a period of at least one year and shall not
      return to active duty until passing a return to active duty drug test as
      required by section 17-608.
