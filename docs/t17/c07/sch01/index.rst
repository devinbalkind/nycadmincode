      violations by such license holder and by any subsequent  license  holder
      at  the  same  place  of  business  unless the subsequent license holder
      provides the commissioner of  the  department  that  has  commenced  the
      proceeding  to recover a civil penalty pursuant to subdivision b of this
      section with adequate documentation demonstrating  that  the  subsequent
      license holder acquired the premises or business through an arm's length
      transaction  as  defined  in  subdivision e of this section and that the
      sale or lease was not conducted, in whole or in part, for the purpose of
      permitting the original licensee to avoid the effect  of  violations  on
      the  premises.  A cigarette license shall be revoked at the same hearing
      at which a retail dealer is found  liable  for  a  second  violation  or
      subsequent  violations at the same place of business within a three-year
      period.
        (6) Any person who violates section 17-708 shall be liable for a civil
      penalty of not more than fifty dollars for each violation.
        b. A proceeding to recover any civil penalty  authorized  pursuant  to
      the  provisions  of  subdivision  a  of  this section for a violation of
      section 17-703, 17-703.1, 17-703.2, 17-704, 17-705  or  17-706  of  this
      subchapter  shall  be  commenced by the service of a notice of violation
      which shall be returnable to  the  health  tribunal  at  the  office  of
    
      administrative  trials  and  hearings where the department of health and
      mental hygiene issues such notice,  the  adjudication  division  of  the
      department  of  consumer  affairs  where that department or a designated
      employee   of   any   authorizing  agency  issues  such  notice,  or  an
      adjudication division of the department of finance or the administrative
      tribunal selected by the commissioner of finance where the department of
      finance issues such notice. Such notice shall contain a  statement  that
      any  hearing  for  a  second violation or subsequent violation of any of
      such sections at the same place of business within a  three-year  period
      shall  also constitute a hearing for the revocation of a retail dealer's
      cigarette license where the retail dealer is found to be in violation of
      any such sections. The department of  health  and  mental  hygiene,  the
      department  of  consumer  affairs  and  the  department of finance shall
      notify each other within thirty days of a  final  determination  that  a
      retail  dealer  has  been  found  to  be in violation of section 17-703,
      17-703.1, 17-703.2, 17-704, 17-705  or  17-706  of  this  subchapter.  A
      proceeding  to  recover  any  civil  penalty  authorized pursuant to the
      provisions of subdivision a of this section for a violation  of  section
      17-708  shall  be  returnable  to  the  health tribunal at the office of
      administrative trials and hearings.  Such tribunal shall have the  power
      to  impose  the  civil  penalties  prescribed  by  subdivision a of this
      section.  The  adjudication  division  of  the  department  of  consumer
      affairs,  the health tribunal at the office of administrative trials and
      hearings and an adjudication division of the department  of  finance  or
      the  administrative  tribunal  selected  by  the commissioner of finance
      shall have the  power  to  impose  the  civil  penalties  prescribed  by
      subdivision  a  of  this  section  for  a  violation  of section 17-703,
      17-703.1, 17-703.2, 17-704, 17-705 or 17-706 of this subchapter.
        c. The penalties provided by subdivision a of this section shall be in
      addition to any other penalty imposed by any other provision of  law  or
      rule promulgated thereunder.
        d.  Whenever  any  person  has  engaged in any acts or practices which
      constitute a violation of any provision of this  subchapter  or  of  any
      rule promulgated thereunder, the city may make application to a court of
      competent jurisdiction for an order enjoining such acts or practices and
      for  an  order granting a temporary or permanent injunction, restraining
      order or other order enjoining such acts or practices.
        e. For purposes of this section, "arm's length  transaction"  means  a
      sale  of  a fee or all undivided interests in real property, or lease of
      any part thereof, or a sale  of  a  business,  in  good  faith  and  for
      valuable consideration, that reflects the fair market value of such real
      property or lease, or business, in the open market, between two informed
      and   willing   parties,  where  neither  is  under  any  compulsion  to
      participate in the transaction, unaffected  by  any  unusual  conditions
      indicating  a reasonable possibility that the sale or lease was made for
      the purpose of permitting the original licensee to avoid the  effect  of
      violations  on  the  premises.  The  following  sales or leases shall be
      presumed  not  to  be  arm's   length   transactions   unless   adequate
      documentation  is  provided demonstrating that the sale or lease was not
      conducted, in whole or in  part,  for  the  purpose  of  permitting  the
      original licensee to avoid the effect of violations on the premises:
        (1) a sale between relatives; or
        (2) a sale between related companies or partners in a business; or
        (3)  a  sale  or  lease  affected by other facts or circumstances that
      would indicate that the sale or lease is entered into  for  the  primary
      purpose  of  permitting  the  original  licensee  to avoid the effect of
      violations on the premises, such as a sale or lease entered  into  while
    
      there  are  violations  pending against the original licensee that could
      result in revocation or suspension of the license.
        f.  Notwithstanding  the  provisions of subdivision a of this section,
      the mandatory revocation of a license for  a  second  offense  shall  be
      waived  if,  upon the submission of satisfactory proof, the commissioner
      determines that the person or persons who committed the violations which
      are the basis for the mandatory revocation acted against the  licensee's
      will  in  committing  such  violations,  the licensee utilized extensive
      precautionary measures  to  prevent  violations  of  the  provisions  of
      sections  17-704,  17-705  and 17-706 of this code, and the licensee has
      terminated any financial or employment relationship with each person who
      committed the violations which are the basis of the mandatory revocation
      of its license  or  has  taken  other  significant  disciplinary  action
      against  such  persons.  The  commissioner  shall  not  determine that a
      licensee utilized extensive precautionary measures to prevent violations
      of the provisions of sections 17-704, 17-705 and  17-706  of  this  code
      unless  the  licensee  submits satisfactory proof demonstrating that the
      licensee had, prior to the second violation which is the basis  for  the
      mandatory revocation of its license, done the following:
        (1)  implemented  a  clear policy requiring all persons working in the
      place of business to strictly comply with  the  provisions  of  sections
      17-704, 17-705 and 17-706 of this code and permitting persons working in
      the  place  of  business to complete a tobacco product sales transaction
      only after establishing the age of a prospective  purchaser  of  tobacco
      products  through identification that has been verified for authenticity
      or through photographic identification as required by section 17-706  of
      this code; and
        (2)  trained  all  persons  working in the place of business to comply
      with any such policy before they are allowed to sell tobacco products to
      the public; and
        (3) monitored the performance of  persons  working  in  the  place  of
      business  to  ensure  that they adhere to such policy, or, in accordance
      with  rules  promulgated  by  the   commissioner,   conducted   periodic
      retraining of persons working in the place of business.
        g.  Any  retail  dealer who fails to pay (1) any civil penalty imposed
      under chapter thirteen of title eleven of the code for the violation  of
      any  provision  thereunder,  or (2) any civil penalty imposed under this
      chapter for any violation thereof or under section 17-176.1  or  section
      17-177  of  this  title  for  any  violation  of such sections, shall be
      subject to suspension of his or her retail dealer license for the  place
      of  business  where the violation occurred until such retail dealer pays
      all such civil penalties.  Such  retail  dealer  license  shall  not  be
      renewed  until  such  retail  dealer  pays  all  such civil penalties. A
      proceeding  to  suspend  a  retail  dealer  license  pursuant  to   this
      subdivision  may  be commenced by the department to which payment of the
      penalty is  due,  in  the  same  manner  as  a  proceeding  pursuant  to
      subdivision   b  of  this  section  to  recover  a  civil  penalty.  The
      adjudication division of the department of consumer affairs, the  health
      tribunal  at  the  office  of  administrative trials and hearings and an
      adjudication division of the department of finance or the administrative
      tribunal selected by the commissioner of finance shall have the power to
      suspend a retail dealer's license pursuant to this subdivision.
