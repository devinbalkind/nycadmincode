      tobacco  or  any  other  substance,  irrespective  of  size or shape and
      whether or not such tobacco or substance  is  flavored,  adulterated  or
      mixed  with  any other ingredient, the wrapper or cover of which is made

      relating to any fruit, chocolate, vanilla, honey, candy, cocoa, dessert,
      alcoholic  beverage,  herb  or spice; provided, however, that no tobacco
      product shall be determined  to  have  a  characterizing  flavor  solely
      because  of  the  use  of  additives  or  flavorings or the provision of
      ingredient information.
        c. "Component part" means any element of a tobacco product, including,
      but not limited to, the tobacco, filter and paper, but not including any

      permitted by the manufacturer to make or disseminate  public  statements
      concerning  such  tobacco  product,  that  such  tobacco  product has or
      produces a characterizing flavor shall constitute  presumptive  evidence
      that the tobacco product is a flavored tobacco product.
        f.  "Herbal cigarette" means a product that is meant to be smoked like
      a cigarette but is composed of one or more herbs and  does  not  contain
      tobacco.

      company, corporation, or employee thereof, or other legal entity.
        h. "Smoke constituent" means any  chemical  or  chemical  compound  in
      mainstream  or  sidestream  tobacco smoke that either transfers from any
      component of the tobacco product to the smoke or that is formed  by  the
      combustion  or  heating  of tobacco, additives or other component of the
      tobacco product.

      subdivision jj of section 17-502 of this code.
        j.  "Tobacco product" means any product which contains tobacco that is

      cigarettes  or  any  product that has been approved by the United States
      food and drug administration for sale as a tobacco use cessation product
      or for other medical purposes and that is being marketed and sold solely
      for such purposes.
