Section 17-1304 ::    
        
     
        § 17-1304  Denial  of  permit. a. Every applicant for a new or renewal
      permit to operate a child care service shall disclose whether a  serious
      injury  or  the  death of a child in its care, or the care of any of its
      owners, directors, employees, volunteers or agents, has occurred.  Every
      such permit applicant shall further disclose any civil or criminal court
      verdicts  holding  that  the applicant, or any of its owners, directors,
      employees, volunteers or agents, was responsible for such serious injury
      or death of a child,  or  administrative  agency  decisions  holding  or
      finding  that  there  is credible evidence that the applicant, or any of
      its owners, directors, employees, volunteers or agents, was  responsible
      for  such  serious  injury  or  death  of a child, and whether any legal
      proceeding involving the serious injury or death of a child  is  pending
      against  the  applicant,  or  any  of  its owners, directors, employees,
      volunteers or agents. The department shall deny such a permit unless, on
      the basis of the application and other papers submitted,  including  the
      information  provided  pursuant  to  this  section,  and on the basis of
      department or city investigation, if  any,  it  is  satisfied  that  the
      provisions  of  the  New  York city health code and other applicable law
      will be met. The death of a child or the occurrence  of  more  than  one
      incident  resulting  in  a  serious injury to a child or children in the
      care of an applicant or permittee shall  create  a  presumption  in  any
      proceeding  brought by the department to deny or revoke such a permit of
      the  inability  of  the  applicant  or  permittee  to  comply  with  the
      provisions  of  said  code or other applicable law. Nothing herein shall
      otherwise limit the department's  authority  to  deny  the  issuance  or
      renewal of a permit or to revoke a permit.
        b. To the extent permissible by law, where the department has received
      written notification that a person with responsibility for oversight and
      direction  of  a  child care service has a felony conviction at any time
      for a sex offense, crime against a child, or a crime involving violence,
      or a felony conviction within the past five  years  for  a  drug-related
      offense,   the   department   shall,   when   consistent   with  article
      twenty-three-A of the correction law, deny the application for a  permit
      to operate such child care service.

      child  care  services  which  has  been  reported  to  the department in
      accordance with applicable law, rules and regulations. Such report shall
      include the name of the child care service and the  child  care  service
      permittee  of  any child care service in which a serious injury or death
