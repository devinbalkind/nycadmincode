      require an autopsy, the chief medical  examiner,  deputy  chief  medical
      examiner  or  medical  examiner  or medical investigator in charge shall
      certify the cause of death and file a report of his or her  findings  in

      by  a  medical  examiner.  Where  indicated,  the  autopsy shall include
      toxicologic, histologic, microbiologic  and  serologic  examinations.  A
      detailed  description  of the findings of all autopsies shall be written

      office in which such application is filed shall forward such application
      to the chief medical examiner who shall thereupon cause an investigation

      toxicologic,  histologic,  microbiologic  and  serologic examinations. A
      detailed description of the findings of all autopsies shall  be  written
