Section 9-106
-------------

Section 9-106 ::    
        
     
        §  9-106  Legislative intent; narcotics treatment program. The charter
      empowers the council as the legislative body of the city of New York  to
      pass  laws  "for  the  order,  protection  and government of persons and
      property; for the preservation of the public health, comfort, peace  and
      prosperity of the city and its inhabitants."
        One  of  the  major  problems  facing  New  York  today, and one which
      involves almost  every  one  of  the  above  enumerated  powers  is  the
      narcotics problem.
        There  has  been  no  abatement in the seriously burgeoning scourge of
      narcotic addiction  in  New  York  city  despite  the  nineteen  hundred
      sixty-two  White  House  conference on narcotics and drug abuses and the
      nineteen hundred  sixty-five  Gracie  Mansion  conference  on  narcotics
      addiction,  the  enactment  and  administration  of  article nine of the
      mental hygiene law, and the various legislative expressions of  interest
      and concern on federal, state and city levels.
        It  has also been adequately demonstrated that the incarceration of an
      addict after an arrest and trial without a specific modality of  medical
      and/or social therapy, even with the involvement of multi-million dollar
      expense  and capital funding, offers no solution to the problem and even
      the establishment of  many  so-called  "half-way  houses"  dealing  with
      after-care and the social needs of the drug addict have failed.
        Sufficient  studies  have  been  made  to  determine that a program of
      treatment which blocks out the craving,  narcotic  hunger  and  euphoria
      associated  with  heroin is successful and by giving maintenance dosages
      of methadone hydrochloride as a complete substitute for heroin,  we  can
      start to drive down the rate of narcotics addiction in our city.
        Between  December  nineteen  hundred  sixty-seven  and  April nineteen
      hundred sixty-eight, the city prison at Rikers Island, was  used  for  a
      demonstration  project  for the use of methadone hydrochloride to combat
      heroin addiction. This voluntary  program  involved  twelve  hard  core,
      intractable,   recidivist   addicts,   with  multiple  arrest  and  long
      conviction records and it achieved remarkable results.
        One of the conclusions of  the  final  report  of  this  demonstration
      project  reveals  that  a  large  number  of  the  four thousand to five
      thousand  addict  prisoners  would  be  willing  to   accept   methadone
      maintenance   treatment   if  it  were  available.  The  applicants  for
      interviews in the  prison  were  so  numerous  that  all  could  not  be
      interviewed.  Letters from prisoners still continue to arrive requesting
      treatment.
        Despite  the  demonstrated  success  of  the  program,  it  is   being
      abandoned.   The final report reflects the reason for not continuing and
      expanding the program  to  realistic  dimensions;  that  reason  is  the
      unavailability  of  funds. This conclusion is difficult to comprehend in
      view of the multi-million dollar funding of other programs,  which  have
      neither revealed any new solutions nor have they demonstrated any degree
      of achievement.
        It  is  not  anticipated that this legislation will solve the problem.
      Hopefully, it will reverse the ever mounting spiral of heroin addiction.

      treatment.
        b. The commissioner of correction shall provide for the continuance of
      such  treatment  by  establishing  parole  procedures   and   after-care

Section 9-116
-------------

Section 9-116 ::    
        
     
        §  9-116 Three platoon system. a. Unless expressly otherwise provided,
      whenever used in this  section,  the  following  terms  shall  mean  and
      include:
        1.  Custodial  officer  shall  mean and include any and all correction
      officers (male), any and all captains, any and all  correction  officers
      (female),  and any and all supervising correction officers (female). For
      the purposes of this section each of the titles enumerated herein  shall
      constitute a single employee classification.
        2.  Working  cycle  shall  mean and include that period of time within
      which each  custodial  officer  in  an  employee  classification  at  an
      institution  shall  be assigned to the same number of each of the normal
      tours of duty. Working cycles may vary as between institutions, and  may
      vary  as  to  the  different  employee  classifications  in  the same or
      different institutions, but in no case may a working  cycle  exceed  one
      calendar year in duration.
        b.  The commissioner of correction or other officer or officers having
      the management, control or direction of  the  department  of  correction
      shall  divide all the custodial officers in each employee classification
      into three platoons at each institution. No one of such platoons nor any
      member thereof shall be assigned to more  than  one  tour  of  duty,  to
      consist  of  not  more  than  ten  consecutive hours in each consecutive
      twenty-four hours, excepting only that in the  event  of  riots,  prison
      breaks  or other similar emergencies, so many of said platoons or of the
      members thereof as may be necessary, may be continued on duty  for  such
      hours as may be necessary. For the purpose of changing tours of duty and
      for  the  necessary  time  consumed  therein,  said  platoons or members
      thereof shall be continued on duty until relieved.
        c. Tours of duty  shall  commence  at  midnight,  eight  o'clock  ante
      meridian  and four o'clock post meridian of each consecutive twenty-four
      hours.  Such tours of duty shall hereinafter  be  designated  as  normal
      tours  of  duty.  At  the  discretion  of the warden or other officer or
      officers in charge of  an  institution,  other  tours  of  duty  may  be
      created.   Such  tours  of  duty  shall  hereinafter  be  designated  as
      miscellaneous tours of duty.
        Within  each  complete  working  cycle  at  each  institution,   every
      custodial  officer in the same employee classification shall be assigned
      to the same number of each of the normal tours of duty. For the  purpose
      of  such  assignment of normal tours of duty as hereinbefore prescribed,
      miscellaneous tours of duty which commence at  or  after  seven  o'clock
      ante  meridian  and  at  or before eleven o'clock ante meridian shall be
      considered to be a part of that normal tour of duty which  commences  at
      eight  o'clock ante meridian; miscellaneous tours of duty which commence
      after eleven  o'clock  ante  meridian  and  before  eight  o'clock  post
      meridian  shall  be  considered to be a part of that normal tour of duty
      which commences at four o'clock post meridian;  miscellaneous  tours  of
      duty  which  commence at or after eight o'clock post meridian and before
      seven o'clock ante meridian shall be considered to be  a  part  of  that
      normal tour of duty which commences at midnight.
        All normal tours of duty which commence at midnight or at four o'clock
      post  meridian,  and  all  miscellaneous  tours  of  duty which shall be
      considered a  part  of  these  normal  tours  of  duty  as  hereinbefore
      prescribed, shall be changed at least once in every calendar month.
        Every  member  of  each  platoon  shall  be  entitled  to at least one
      calendar day of rest upon the completion of every  six  tours  of  duty.
      This  day  of  rest  shall not be deferred longer than one calendar week
      after such member has become entitled thereto.
        None of the foregoing provisions of this section  shall  apply  to  or
      govern  the  rotation  of tours of duty of custodial officers who may be
    
      detailed or assigned to an institution wherein no inmates  are  detained
      overnight.
        Where in any single institution the total number of custodial officers
      in  any single employee classification is less than four in number, none
      of the foregoing provisions of this section shall apply to or govern the
      rotation of tours of duty of members of such employee classification  in
      said institution.
        None  of  the  foregoing  provisions of this section shall apply to or
      govern the rotation of tours of duty of custodial officers  who  may  be
      detailed  or  assigned to what shall hereinafter be known and designated
      as the special duty squad at each institution, provided,  however,  that
      the  number of custodial officers detailed or assigned to a special duty
      squad at any single institution may not exceed twenty-five per centum of
      the total number of custodial officers employed at the said institution;
      provided, however, that  custodial  officers  detailed  or  assigned  to
      special  duty  squads  may  be assigned only to that normal tour of duty
      commencing at eight o'clock ante meridian, or to miscellaneous tours  of
      duty  constituting  a  part  of  such  normal tour of duty; and provided
      further, however, that throughout the department of correction the total
      number of custodial officers detailed or assigned  to  steady  tours  of
      duty,  whether as members of special duty squads or otherwise, shall not
      exceed fifteen per centum of the  total  number  of  custodial  officers
      employed  in  the  department  of  correction.  None  of  the  foregoing
      provisions of this subdivision shall apply to or govern the rotation  of
      tours  of  duty of custodial officers who may be detailed or assigned to
      steady tours of duty for reasons of management efficiency, which reasons
      shall presumptively include the subdivision of a  facility  and/or  unit
      into smaller units of management.
        d. All custodial officers shall be allowed a vacation period as may be
      authorized  in  leave  regulations  promulgated  by the mayor. During an
      emergency, as defined herein, the vacation period may  be  withheld  for
      such  length  of  time  as  may  be  necessary.  Upon  cessation of such
      emergency each of such custodial officers from  whom  a  vacation  or  a
      portion  of  a  vacation shall have been withheld during such emergency,
      shall receive within six months from such cessation a leave  of  absence
      with pay commensurate with the number of days of such vacation withheld.
        f. All general or specific laws inconsistent with this section or with
      any  part  thereof  are  hereby  repealed;  provided, however, that this
      section shall in no manner affect any provisions of said law  concerning
      furlough  or  leave of absence or exempting members of the department of
      correction from obligation to wear uniform when not on actual duty.
