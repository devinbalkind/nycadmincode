      pursue  education  and training activities as set forth in this chapter,
      and shall contain the following statement:
        "Your Education and Training Rights
        When you come for your appointment, we will tell you about your rights
      to participate in education and training programs. The hours  you  spend
      in   education   and  training  programs  may  count  toward  your  work
      requirement.
        A Master List of Programs
        You have a right to receive the complete "HRA Consolidated Master List
      of Approved Training Programs." This is a list of education and training
      programs you can choose to go to. Hours spent in  any  program  on  that
      list will count toward your work requirement.
        Other Choices for Training and Education
        You  can also go to education or training programs that are not on the
      Consolidated Master List. However, those programs must meet  appropriate
      City or State standards.
        Time To Find the Right Program for You
        If  you  need  to  participate  in an education or training program in
      order to improve your chances of getting a job,  we  must  give  you  15
      business  days  before  your  assessment,  upon your request, to find an
      appropriate education or training program.
        If You Are Already In an Education or Training Program
        If you are already in school we must  allow  you  to  remain  in  your
      program  as long as your program appears on the "HRA Consolidated Master
      List of Approved Training Programs" or meets the City or State standards
      mentioned above.
        Reassessment
        If you are dissatisfied with the work activity to which you have  been
      assigned for six months or more and you believe that you are eligible to
      attend  education or training, you should request a reassessment of your
      employability. If you are found to be eligible to attend a  training  or
      education program, you can switch into an education or training program.
      Again,  your  choice must appear on the "HRA Consolidated Master List of
      Approved Training Programs" or meet appropriate City or State standards.
      If you are already in a work activity, you do not have a 15 business day
      period to find an education or training program. In this case, you  must
      continue  in  your  work  activity  while  you  look for an education or
      training program.
        Your Right to a Fair Hearing
        The agency must give you a copy of your employability plan. You have a
      right to a fair hearing to challenge your assignment."
