      other person visiting an inmate of such institution who is in  whole  or

Section 21-106
--------------

Section 21-106 ::    
        
     
        §  21-106 Payments to private institutions. Payments shall not be made
      by the city to any charitable, eleemosynary or reformatory  institutions
      wholly  or  partly under private control, for the care, support, secular
      education or maintenance of any destitute, neglected or delinquent child
      therein, except upon the certificate of the commissioner that such child
      has been received and is retained by such institution  pursuant  to  the
      rules  and regulations established by the state board of social welfare.
      Moneys paid by the city to any such institution for the  care,  support,
      secular  education  or  maintenance of its inmates shall not be expended
      for any other purpose. Whenever the  commissioner  shall  decide,  after
      reasonable notice to such institution and a hearing, that any such child
      who  is received and retained in such institution is not a proper charge
      against the public, and written notice of such decision is given by  the
      commissioner  to  such  institution,  thereupon all right on the part of
      such institution to receive compensation from the city for  the  further
      retention  of  the child shall cease. The commissioner shall file in the
      office of the department a statement of  the  reasons  for  his  or  her
      decision  and of the facts upon which it is founded, and shall furnish a
      copy to such institution where the child is detained. The commissioner's
      decision may be reviewed on certiorari by the supreme court.
        No money shall be paid out of any  appropriation  to  any  charitable,
      eleemosynary  or  reformatory  institution  which  shall  deny  or limit
      admission to  any  destitute,  neglected  or  delinquent  children  duly
      committed  by  the  commissioner or a court of appropriate jurisdiction,
      because of the race, color  or  religion  of  such  children,  provided,
      however,  that  no  institution of a particular religious faith shall be
      required to accept children adhering to a religious faith other than its
      own.
        The commission on foster care of children shall  have  the  power  and
      continuing  duty  to  investigate and determine, upon complaint made and
      shall have the power on its own initiative to investigate and  determine
      whether any institution is practicing discrimination in violation of the
      provisions  of  the  preceding paragraph. The commission may direct that
      such investigation shall be conducted by one or more of its  members  or
      by its secretary or assistant secretary. Whenever in the judgment of the
      commission, such investigation discloses that there is reason to believe
      that  an  institution is practicing discrimination, the commission shall
      cause a hearing to be held before the commission or before two  or  more
      of  its  members,  as  it  may  direct,  upon  reasonable notice to such
      institution. The commission shall dismiss the proceedings  if  it  finds
      upon  the basis of such hearing, that such institution is not practicing
      discrimination. In the event the commission shall find on the  basis  of
      such  hearing,  that  such  institution is practicing discrimination, it
      shall certify to the commissioner its findings of  fact,  together  with
      its  determination of the period of time, not to exceed one year, within
      which the institution shall be permitted  to  amend  its  practices  and
      comply  with  said  provisions.  The  commissioner shall thereupon serve
      notice of such certification on such institution. All right on the  part
      of such institution to receive moneys from the city shall cease upon the
      date  specified  in  said  certification unless, prior to the expiration
      thereof, such institution shall have submitted to the  commission  proof
      that it has ceased to engage in said violations and the commission shall
      have  found  and certified to the commissioner that said institution has
      complied with said provisions. The institution shall not be deprived  of
      payments  for  services  rendered  prior  to  the  date specified in the
      certification. The determination of the commission that  an  institution
      is  practicing  discrimination,  or  having  been  ordered to cease said
      discrimination has failed to cease,  may  be  reviewed  by  the  supreme
    
      court,  which  may,  for  good  cause shown, during the pendency of such
      review, stay the termination of the right of such institution to receive
      moneys from the city. The commission, or any of its  members  authorized
      by  it  to  conduct  a  hearing,  may,  at  any such hearing, compel the
      attendance of witnesses, administer oaths, take  the  testimony  of  any
      person under oath and require the production of any evidence relating to
      the   matter  in  question  at  the  hearing.  The  department  and  the
      corporation counsel are authorized upon request by  the  commission,  to
      make  members  of  their  respective  staffs available, upon a temporary
      basis, to the commission, to assist it in conducting the  investigations
      and hearings provided by this section.
    
    
    
    
    
    
    

Section 21-107
--------------

Section 21-107 ::    
        
     
        § 21-107 Power of commissioner as to removal of destitute persons. The
      commissioner  shall  have  power  to  pay for the cost of the removal or
      transportation of any person  who  may  come  under  the  commissioner's
      charge whenever in his or her judgment the city will thereby be relieved
      from an unnecessary or improper charge.
    
    
    
    
    
    
    

Section 21-108
--------------

Section 21-108 ::    
        
     
        § 21-108 Support of poor persons by relatives. a. The spouse or parent
      of  a  recipient  of  public assistance or care or of a person liable to
      become in need thereof shall, if of sufficient ability,  be  responsible
      for  the  support  of  such  person,  provided  that  a  parent shall be
      responsible only for the support of his or her minor child. Step-parents
      shall in  a  like  manner  be  responsible  for  the  support  of  minor
      step-children.
        b.  If  a sufficiently able relative of a poor person fails to support
      him or her, as in this section provided, and such person is being  cared
      for  or  is about to be cared for by the commissioner, such commissioner
      may apply to the family court for an order to compel him or her  to  pay
      the  reasonable  charge  determined by such commissioner for the care of
      such  relative  during  his  or  her  stay  in  the  public  or  private
      institution,  or  home where the commissioner has placed him or her. The
      proceedings to be taken to make such order and to enforce the same shall
      be in the name of and conducted by the commissioner.  The  determination
      of such commissioner as to the reasonableness of such charges may at any
      time be reviewed in the family court.
        c.  Evidence that the poor person mentioned in this section is without
      adequate means of support shall be presumptive proof of the  possibility
      of  his  or  her  becoming  a  public  charge. The relative against whom
      proceedings are begun for the support of a poor person shall be taken to
      be of sufficient ability  to  contribute  to  the  support,  unless  the
      contrary  shall affirmatively appear to the satisfaction of the court or
      a judge or justice thereof.
        d. Instead of bringing legal proceedings as in this section specified,
      the commissioner can directly enter into an agreement  with  a  relative
      for the payment of the charges determined by such commissioner to be the
      reasonable  charge  for the care of the person maintained or about to be
      maintained by such commissioner as a public charge.

      If it shall at any time be ascertained that any person, who has received
      support or care or treatment from the city through the commissioner, has
      real or personal property or other means  of  enabling  him  or  her  to
      reimburse  the city, an action may be maintained in a court of competent
      jurisdiction, by such commissioner, against such person or  his  or  her
      estate  to  recover  such sums of money as may have been expended by the
      city through such commissioner in the support or care  or  treatment  of
      such person during the period of ten years next preceding such discovery
      or the death of such person.
        b.  Instead  of  bringing  the  legal  proceedings  as in this section
      specified, such commissioner may determine the reasonable value of  such
      support  or  care  or  treatment,  and  enter  into an agreement for its
      payment.

      places  for  the  poor  and  strangers and from time to time enclose and
      extend the same to make enclosures therein and to build vaults  therein,

      therein  shall  continue  under rules and regulations established by the

      In addition, where the solicitation of funds is by appeal in person  and

        §  21-118 New York city commission for the foster care of children. a.
      There is hereby established the New York city commission for the  foster
      care  of  children  (hereinafter  referred  to  as  the "commission") to
      consist of fifteen public members, who shall serve without compensation,
      to be appointed by the mayor from among residents of  the  city  of  New
      York  who have been active in, identified with, or otherwise known to be
      interested in the field of child care. In making such appointments,  the
      mayor shall make every effort to appoint individuals associated with the
      major  federations  concerned  with foster care services to children and
      individuals who are associated with organizations which, through  direct
      services to children, coordination or planning of services for children,
      or  through  research  in  the  field  of  child  care, are making major
      contributions to the planning of services for the children of  the  city
      of  New York. The membership of the commission shall reflect disciplines
      basic to a wholesome child  welfare  program  including  mental  health,
      education,  religion,  law  with  some  specialty  in  family  and child
      welfare, and pediatrics. The mayor  may  appoint,  and  at  his  or  her
      pleasure remove, an executive director and an assistant to the executive
      director of the commission. The salary of the executive director and the
      assistant  to  the  executive  director  shall be fixed by the mayor and
      shall be paid from appropriations  made  to  the  department.  The  said
      public members shall serve for a term of four years except that the term
      of  office  of the members first taking office shall expire, five at the
      end of two years, five at the end of three years and five at the end  of
      four  years. No member shall serve for more than eight consecutive years
      after July one, nineteen hundred sixty-four. The mayor shall  appoint  a
      chairperson and a vice chairperson from among the members, each to serve
      in  that capacity for two year terms. Any public member appointed by the
      mayor to fill a vacancy occurring prior to the expiration  of  the  term
      for  which  his  or her predecessor was appointed shall be appointed for
      the remainder of such term.
        b. The commission shall meet at least once every month  except  during
      the  months  of  July  and  August and shall meet at such other times as
      meetings are called by the chairperson. Whenever requested to do  so  in
      writing by any six members of the commission, the chairperson shall call
      a special meeting of the commission. Full time professional and clerical
      assistance,  properly  qualified,  shall  be provided as required to the
      commission by the department.
        c. The commission shall have the following powers and duties:
        (1) Make recommendations to the commissioner and to the administrative

      New  York  on  all  phases  of  the  foster  care  of children including
      recommendations designed to prevent the need for such care.
        (2) Make  recommendations  to  the  appropriate  authorities  for  the
      establishment  of  proper  standards  for  the  foster care of children,
      except insofar as such standards have been established pursuant  to  law
      by  the  board  of health of the city of New York or the board of social
      welfare of the state of New York.
        (3) Study and report the extent and nature of the facilities  required
      to provide adequate foster care for children.
        (4)  Coordinate temporary care services and make recommendations as to
      the type of children and the age range to be admitted to  any  temporary
      shelter, in order that the needs of children may be served by the proper
      and adequate provision of accommodations, and so as to avoid duplication
      or overlapping of service.
        (5)   Individually   or   collectively  visit  temporary  shelters  in
      accordance with rules promulgated by the commission;  recommend  to  the
      commissioner  and to the administrative judge of the family court of the
    
      state of New York within the city of New York  studies  of  foster  care
      facilities with the cooperation of private agencies.
        (6)  Recommend  that  the department maintain such records and compile
      such statistics as the commission may deem  desirable,  subject  to  the
      approval of the commissioner.
        (7)  Through  appropriate  channels,  advise  foster care agencies and
      institutions receiving public funds  on  all  matters  relating  to  the
      development  and  modification  of programs to meet changing foster care
      needs.
        (8) Make appropriate recommendations to the commissioner  and  to  the
      administrative judge of the family court of the state of New York within

      affecting the foster  care  of  children,  annually  or  more  often  as
      required.
        (9) Make appropriate recommendations to reduce insofar as possible the
      length of stay of children in temporary shelters.
        d.  Whenever  required  to  do  so  by the commission or an authorized
      representative thereof, any public official or agency of the city of New
      York possessing information relating to the maintenance or operation  of
      institutions  or  agencies  for  the  care  of  children, or maintaining
      records with respect thereto, shall make such  information  and  records
      available,  and  shall  furnish  transcripts  or  copies thereof, to the
      commission.
        e. It shall be the function of this commission to utilize all  methods
      provided  by law to discourage and prevent any discrimination because of
      race, color or national origin in the foster care of children.
        f. In relation to foster care of children the  commission  shall  make
      appropriate  recommendations  for  the  enforcement of all provisions of
      laws relating to foster care including those laws which provide for  the
      preservation  and  protection of the religious faith of the child to the
      end that whenever a child is placed or committed by  the  department  or
      remanded  or  committed by the family court to any family or to any duly
      authorized association, agency, society, or institution, such placement,
      remand or commitment must be made, when practicable, to a family or to a
      duly authorized association, agency, society, or institution  under  the
      control  of persons of the same religious faith or persuasion as that of
      the child; provided that  any  and  all  such  foster  care  placements,
      whenever  made,  shall  assure  the  preservation  and protection of the
      religious faith of the child.
        g. Whenever used in this section the following  terms  shall  mean  or
      include:
        (1)  "Foster  care  for  children."  The care of abandoned, destitute,
      dependent, neglected or  delinquent  children  or  persons  in  need  of
      supervision away from their own homes in institutions or foster homes or

      to section three hundred ninety of the social services  law  and,  where
      appropriate, designating such provider as eligible to provide subsidized
      child  care.  In  making  such a determination, the administration shall
      consider, but is not limited to considering, the following:
        (i) that clearance with the State Central Register of Child Abuse  and
      Maltreatment  has  been  completed  for  the  applicant  or  child  care
      provider, every employee of such child care provider,  volunteer  acting
      on  behalf of such child care provider and for any person eighteen years
      of age or older who resides in the home of such applicant or child  care
      provider;
        (ii)  whether  the applicant or child care provider, every employee of
      such child care provider, volunteer acting on behalf of such child  care
      provider  or  any  person  residing  in  the  applicant's  or child care
      provider's household who is sixteen years of age or older has  a  record
      of criminal conviction, to the extent such information is available;
        (iii)  that the applicant or child care provider and every employee of
      such child care provider, volunteer acting on behalf of such child  care
      provider  and  all  other  members  of  the  household have had a health
      examination and been  examined  for  tuberculosis  within  the  previous
      twelve months;
        (iv) that the child care provider maintains a register, or an approved
      equivalent,  in  a  form  to be provided by the New York state office of
    
      children and family services or provided for  such  purpose  by  another
      city  or  state  office  showing  for  each child for whom child care is
      provided:
        (a) the name and date of birth of such child;
        (b)  the  names  and  addresses  of  his  or  her  parents,  including
      designated emergency contact persons and their telephone numbers; and
        (c) such other information as may be required by the state  office  of
      children and family services or other appropriate agency or office;
        (v)  that  the  child  care provider has received or shall receive not
      less than the training required by section three hundred ninety-a of the
      social services law and any regulations promulgated pursuant thereto  or
      the  plan  approved  pursuant  to  paragraph  f  of subdivision three of
      section three hundred ninety of the social services law where such  plan
      establishes different training requirements;
        (vi)  that  children  in  child  care  have  received  or will receive
      instruction, consistent with their age, needs and circumstances as  well
      as the needs and circumstances of the child care provider, in techniques
      and  procedures  which  will  enable such children to protect themselves
      from abuse and maltreatment; and
        (vii) that the child care provider has a daily program that meets  all
      applicable requirements set forth in parts 416 and 417 of title eighteen
      of  the  official compilation of the codes, rules and regulations of the
      state of New York, or any superseding regulations;
        14. providing technical assistance to a child care provider  in  order
      to assure compliance with all applicable laws, regulations and rules and
      other  services  to  ensure  safe and suitable care to children which is
      supportive  of  their  physical,  intellectual,  emotional  and   social
      well-being;
        15.  assisting  parents in choosing an appropriate child care provider
      from among the child care providers eligible to provide subsidized child
      care;
        16. providing detailed written information about the child  and  adult
      care  food  program  operated  by  or  on  behalf  of  the United States
      department of agriculture to every provider of subsidized child care who
      is not enrolled in such program and to every applicant seeking to become
      a provider of subsidized child care at  the  time  such  application  is
      submitted; and
        17.  encouraging  providers  and applicants to enroll in the child and
      adult care food program and assisting such persons in enrolling  and  to
      offer  child  care during times of day or days that enhance the capacity
      of  parents  to  seek  out  and  avail  themselves  of  employment   and
      educational opportunities.
        c.  In  the event that an authorized family child care service obtains
      information that a provider of subsidized child care cannot  provide  or
      is  not  providing child care in accordance with the requirements of all
      applicable laws, rules and regulations, the authorized family child care
      service  shall  immediately  provide  the   administration   with   such
      information. If the administration concludes that safe and suitable care
      to  children  which  is  supportive  of  their  physical,  intellectual,
      emotional, and social well-being cannot be or  is  not  being  provided,
      such  child  care  provider  shall not be eligible to provide subsidized
      child care in such  home.  The  administration  shall  not  continue  to
      subsidize  through any mechanism the child care of children in such home
      until such time as the administration has  determined  that  such  child
      care provider can provide such safe and suitable care.
        d.  1.  Not later than sixty days following the effective date of this
      section, the administration shall  submit  in  accordance  with  section
      three hundred ninety of the social services law a plan or all amendments
    
      to  any  existing  plan  necessary to make such plan consistent with the
      provisions of this section, together with an explanation justifying  the
      need  to  impose  additional  requirements  upon providers of subsidized
      child  care  and  a  plan  to  monitor  compliance  with such additional
      requirements and all applicable laws, regulations and rules.
        2. The plan submitted by the administration  shall  request  authority
      for the administration to provide the training mandated by section 390-a
      of the social services law or the plan or delegate the provision of such
      training  to an authorized family child care service. The administration
      shall include in this request an application for  the  release  of  such
      funds as may be available for such training within the city of New York.
      The  authority  of  the  administration to provide training under such a
      plan shall be contingent upon granting of the authority and the  release
      of funds from the state.
        3.  The  plan  submitted  by  the  administration  shall  also include
      provisions imposing upon every provider of  subsidized  child  care  the
      following requirements:
        (i)  such  child  care  provider's  home  shall  be made available for
      inspection by the administration or  an  authorized  family  child  care
      service  for  the  purpose  of determining that such child care provider
      meets the requirements of section three hundred  ninety  of  the  social
      services  law,  the  regulations  promulgated  thereunder  and  any plan
      approved pursuant to section three hundred ninety of the social services
      law and that the child care provider is capable of  providing  safe  and
      suitable  care  to  children  which  is  supportive  of  their physical,
      intellectual, emotional and social well-being. When the inspection is to
      be conducted by an authorized family child care service, the child  care
      provider  shall  furnish  to such authorized family child care service a
      true copy of the provider's completed application  form  and  all  other
      supporting documents and related materials in the provider's possession;
        (ii)  when it is determined that the home of a child care provider who
      desires to provide subsidized child care is not in full compliance  with
      all  applicable  laws,  regulations  and  rules, the child care provider
      shall bring such home into full compliance  with  all  applicable  laws,
      regulations and rules;
        (iii)  a  child  care provider shall be eligible to provide subsidized
      child care only if such provider will:
        (a) personally provide the child care in the provider's own home;
        (b) be the only provider of child care in that home; and
        (c) provide assistant caregivers in a group  family  child  care  home
      with  any  and  all  employment benefits as may be required by state and
      federal law, including paying such caregivers at least the minimum  wage
      set forth in article nineteen of the labor law;
        (iv)  ensure  that  each  caregiver  and  any  assistant caregiver has
      received or will receive not less than fifteen hours of training  within
      the  first  year  of  their registration or licensure, and each biennial
      period thereafter, which training shall begin prior  to  or  within  the
      first  three months after the placement with such child care provider of
      the first child whose child care  is  subsidized  through  attending  or
      completing  programs that upon completion provide six hours of training.
      Such training shall include, but shall not be limited to, the  following
      topics:
        (a) principles of early childhood development;
        (b) nutrition and health needs of infants and children;
        (c) child care program development;
        (d) safety and security procedures;
        (e) business record maintenance and management;
        (f) child abuse and maltreatment identification and prevention;
    
        (g) all laws, regulations and rules pertaining to child care and child
      abuse and maltreatment.
        e.  Within  sixty  days  of receipt of written approval of the plan or
      amendments to any existing plan submitted pursuant to subdivision  d  of
      this  section,  the  administration  shall  take  all steps necessary to
      implement such plan or amended plan and monitor compliance by child care
      providers and any authorized family child care service.
        f. In drafting a plan or amendments to any existing plan  as  required
      by  subdivision d of this section, the administration shall include such
      other provisions as are necessary to implement the requirements of  this
      section.
        g.  In  the  event that any portion of the plan or any of the proposed
      amendments to an existing plan submitted pursuant to  subdivision  d  of
      this  section  is  not  approved,  that disapproval shall not affect any
      other provision of such plan or amendment and each  provision  shall  be
      implemented and enforced to the extent approved by the state.
        h.  Nothing  in  the  plan submitted pursuant to subdivision d of this
      section is intended to be nor shall it be construed in such a manner  as
      to  be  inconsistent with any provision of federal law or any regulation
      promulgated thereunder, nor shall be it be construed  as  affecting  any
      provision of section three hundred ninety of the social services law and
      any  regulations  promulgated  thereunder  authorizing  any  enforcement
      activity against a child care provider including, but not limited to,  a
      proceeding   to  suspend,  revoke,  limit  or  terminate  a  license  or
      registration to provide child care. If any provision is so construed  by
      a  court  of law or if a written determination or other notice is issued
      by a state or federal agency or office that there will be a  significant
      loss  of  funding  as a result of any provision, such provision shall be
      null and void.

Section 21-124. ::    
        
     
        §  21-124.  Prohibiting  the use of Tier I shelters. a. The city shall
      not establish henceforth any Tier I shelters as defined in  18  NYCRR  §
      900.2  through  § 900.18. After September 30, 1991, the city of New York
      shall not operate any Tier I shelters.
        b. 1. No homeless family shelter shall be established which  does  not
      provide  a  bathroom,  a  refrigerator  and  cooking  facilities  and an
      adequate sleeping area within each unit within  the  shelter  and  which
      otherwise  complies with state and local laws. All Tier II shelter units
      shall be such that they may  be  converted  to  be  used  for  permanent
      housing with a minimum of structural change.
        2.  The  following  units  are exempted or partially exempted from the
      provisions of paragraph one of this subdivision: (i) the Tier  II  units
      presently  in operation shall be exempt; (ii) the 2,450 units of Tier II
      shelter housing currently in the construction pipeline shall be  exempt;
      and  (iii)  units  in  facilities  for  battered  women or substance and
      alcohol abusers which meet all state requirements for such programs  may
      provide congregate dining and bathing arrangements.
        3. The requirements of this subdivision shall not apply in cases where
      the provisions of § 21-121 (3) are invoked.
        c. Until June 30, 1992, notwithstanding any provision of this section,
      the  mayor  may  authorize  homeless  families  to  be  sheltered in any
      facility approved by the appropriate state authority  for  such  purpose
      upon  a  finding  by  the  commissioner  that the city has more homeless
      families in need of shelter than the system  can  accommodate,  for  the
      following  reasons:  (1)  the  pattern  of  length  of  stay of families
      entering the system  each  month  shows  that  the  length  of  stay  is
      increasing   over   time;   (2)  the  city  has  experienced  unexpected
      impediments to  the  construction  or  rehabilitation  of  permanent  or
      transitional   housing   units,  including,  but  not  limited  to  work
      stoppages, natural disasters, unanticipated site conditions relating  to
      such  matters  as  soil  conditions,  contractor delays, availability of
      sewers, or the presence of asbestos which requires remedial action;  (3)
      the  city  has  not  obtained  necessary approval for sites selected for
      facilities  to  shelter   homeless   families;   (4)   construction   or
      rehabilitation   of  permanent  or  transitional  housing  for  homeless
      families has been and continues to be enjoined by court  order;  (5)  an
      emergency such as a flood, earthquake or fire, or a medical emergency as
      certified  by the commissioner of health, has rendered existing shelters
      unsuitable for use  to  house  homeless  families;  (6)  the  number  of
      homeless  families  requesting emergency housing exceeds the capacity of
      the  system  at  any  point  in  time;  or  (7)  any   other   emergency
      circumstance.  Such  finding  shall be made in writing and shall specify
      the time the commissioner anticipates will be needed  for  the  city  to
      meet  the  requirements  of  subdivisions a and b. Such finding shall be
      delivered  promptly,  and,  when  practicable,  prior  to  the  use   of
      facilities  pursuant  to  this subdivision, to the mayor, the speaker of
      the council, any council member in whose district  families  are  to  be
      sheltered  pursuant to this subdivision, and to the families who receive
      shelter in facilities not meeting the requirements of subdivisions a and
      b. Within fifteen days of having made such finding, and  at  such  other
      times  as the council may request, the mayor shall report to the council
      on the plans to meet the requirements of subdivisions a and  b  and  the
      progress that has been made in implementing such plans. The commissioner
      shall  insure  that  the  social  service  and medical needs of families
      sheltered pursuant to this subdivision shall be met in  accordance  with
      state  regulations  in  18  NYCRR  §  900.2 through § 900.18 for Tier II
      shelters. Notwithstanding  any  provision  of  this  paragraph,  between
      September  30,  1991 and June 30, 1992, the shelters located at 282 East
    
      3rd Street and 151 East 151st Street may be used for families except for
      homeless families with children.
        d.  Notwithstanding  the provisions of this section, on and after July
      1, 1992, the commissioner of social services,  after  consultation  with
      the  speaker  of  the  council,  may  certify  that an emergency exists,
      pursuant to the criteria expressed in subdivision c, that  requires  the
      use  of  tier  I  shelters to meet legal mandates to provide shelter for
      homeless persons  and,  upon  transmission  of  such  certification  for
      publication  in the City Record together with a statement of the reasons
      therefor, which shall include a statement and documentation  that  there
      is  no  other  alternative  form of shelter available that complies with
      state and local regulations including invoking the powers under § 21-121
      (3), may direct the use of such tier I  shelters  which  are  consistent
      with  state  and  local  laws  as  are  necessary to meet the emergency;
      provided, however, that the commissioner  of  social  services  may  not
      utilize  a  tier  I shelter for more than forty-five days unless a local
      law shall be enacted permitting such use for the shelter.

      staff "homeless diversion teams"  at  each  income  support  center  and

      eligibility requirements, is deceased,  or  upon  certification  by  the
