      formula  which  would apply to the year of death under subparagraph (ii)
      of this paragraph nine if such death had not occurred, but  prorated  on
      the  basis  of  the number of full calendar months the beneficiary lived
      during the year of death prior to the month of his or her death;

      occurs both after the year of retirement and in the  calendar  year  two

      allowance"),  the  amount  of  such  variable  supplement  payable for a
      calendar year or a part of such calendar year to such beneficiary  shall
      be reduced by the amount of such other supplemental retirement allowance
      that  is  payable  to  such  beneficiary  to  the extent that such other

      paragraph seven or paragraph eight of subdivision  a  of  this  section,
      whose  variable  supplements  payments  are  being  reduced  pursuant to
      subparagraph (i) of this paragraph one because such  other  supplemental
      retirement  allowance is also payable to that beneficiary, the reduction
      provided for in such subparagraph (i) shall cease as to such beneficiary
      on the later of (A) the first day of the month next following the  month

      because  such other supplemental retirement allowance is also payable to
      that beneficiary, the reduction provided for in  such  subparagraph  (i)
      shall  cease as to such beneficiary on the later of (A) the first day of
      the month following the month in  which  such  beneficiary  attains  age

      eight.
        (iv)  In any case where the reduction of variable supplements payments
      to a pension fund beneficiary has ceased pursuant to  subparagraph  (ii)
      or  subparagraph  (iii) of this paragraph one, that beneficiary, for the
      purpose of determining his or her eligibility for and the amount of  any
      other supplemental retirement allowance, shall be deemed to have retired
      on  the  date  of  the  cessation  of  such  reduction  specified in the
      applicable provisions of such subparagraph (ii) or subparagraph (iii).

      authorized by this subchapter and the granting and receipt thereof:
        (i) shall  not  create  or  constitute  membership  in  a  pension  or

      payments, subject to the provisions of subparagraphs  (i)  and  (ii)  of
      paragraph  one  of  subdivision  b of this section, that he or she would
      have received, had he or she retired on the date of his or her  earliest
