        * (g)  (i)  Commencing on August first, nineteen hundred eighty-three,
      and continuing thereafter, "regular interest", in the cases  of  persons
      who  were members on July thirty-first, nineteen hundred eighty-three or
      who thereafter became or become members,  shall  mean,  subject  to  the
    
      provisions  of  subparagraph  (ii)  to (x), inclusive, of this paragraph
      (g), interest at seven per centum per annum, compounded annually.
        (ii)  (A)  (1)  Subject  to the provisions of sub-items (2) and (3) of
      this item (A), regular interest at the rate  of  seven  per  centum  per
      annum,  compounded  annually,  shall  be  used as the actuarial interest
      assumption for determining any actuarial equivalent benefit  payable  to
      or  on  account  of  any  seven  percent member for actuarial equivalent
      benefit purposes.
        (2) Where  an  actuarial  equivalent  benefit  is  required  by  board
      resolution  to  be determined for any seven percent member for actuarial
      equivalent benefit purposes through the use of  the  modified  Option  1

      actuarial equivalent benefit shall be  determined  for  any  such  seven
      percent member on the basis of gender-neutral mortality tables, and that
      the  remainder  of  such  benefit  shall  be  determined on the basis of
      mortality tables which are not gender-neutral, regular interest  at  the
      rate  of  seven per centum per annum, compounded annually, shall be used
      as the actuarial interest assumption for determining the portion of such
      benefit required by such resolution to be determined  on  the  basis  of
      gender-neutral  mortality tables and such rate of regular interest shall
      not apply to the determination of the remainder of such benefit.
        (B) Notwithstanding that the process of determining whether  a  member
      is  a seven percent member for actuarial equivalent benefit purposes may
      include, for the purpose of ascertaining the highest applicable benefit,
      alternative  hypothetical  benefit  calculations  utilizing  a  rate  of
      regular  interest  other  than  such  rate  of seven per centum, nothing
      contained in subparagraph (i) of this paragraph (g) or in  item  (A)  of
      this  subparagraph  (ii)  shall  be  construed  as requiring that in the
      determination of any actuarial  equivalent  benefit  payable  to  or  on
      account  of  any  member who is not a seven percent member for actuarial
      equivalent benefit purposes,  any  rate  of  interest  be  used  as  the
      actuarial  interest  assumption  other than regular interest, compounded
      annually, as prescribed by the applicable provisions of paragraph (a) of
      this subdivision.
        (iii) The  provisions  of  item  (A)  of  subparagraph  (ii)  of  this
      paragraph  (g) shall not apply to any person who, prior to August first,
      nineteen hundred eighty-three, retired as a member of the  pension  fund
      for service or superannuation or for ordinary or accident disability and
      was  such  a  retiree  immediately  prior to such August first, provided
      however, that if any such retiree returned or  returns  to  city-service
      and,  on  or after July thirty-first, nineteen hundred eighty-three, was
      or is restored  to  membership  in  the  pension  fund  as  required  or
      permitted  by  law,  the provisions of such item (A), from and after the
      date of such restoration to membership, shall  apply  to  such  restored
      member with respect to determination of any actuarial equivalent benefit
      which  is  both  (A)  a  benefit  to  which  he or she became or becomes
      entitled  upon  his  or  her   subsequent   retirement   or   subsequent
      discontinuance  of  service  so  as  to  qualify for benefits, and (B) a
      benefit which is not a continuation, without change, of a benefit  which
      had  previously  become  payable  to  him or her by reason of his or her
      prior  retirement;  provided  further  that  nothing  contained  in  the
      preceding  provisions  of this subparagraph shall be construed as making
      the provisions of item (A) of such subparagraph (ii) applicable  to  any
      such  restored  member  who was not or is not a seven percent member for
    
      actuarial equivalent benefit purposes at the time  for  such  subsequent

      such  circumstances  that  such member became a discontinued member, and
      (2) was such a discontinued member  immediately  prior  to  such  August
      first.
        (B)  If such a discontinued member returned or returns to city-service
      and on or after July thirty-first,  nineteen  hundred  eighty-three  and
      before  payability  of  his  or  her retirement allowance as such member
      began or  begins,  again  becomes  an  active  member  pursuant  to  the
      applicable   provisions  of  section  13-256  of  this  subchapter,  the
      provisions of item (A) of such subparagraph (ii) shall apply to  him  or
      her  on  and  after  the  date  of such resumption of active membership;
      provided that nothing contained in the preceding provisions of this item

      subparagraph  (ii) applicable to any such member who was not or is not a
      seven percent member for actuarial equivalent benefit  purposes  at  the
      time of subsequent retirement or subsequent discontinuance of service so
      as to qualify for benefits.

      pursuant to the applicable provisions of section 13-256 of the code, the
      provisions of item (A) of such subparagraph (ii), on and after the  date

      both  (1)  a  benefit to which he or she became or becomes entitled upon
      his or her subsequent retirement or subsequent discontinuance of service
      so as to qualify for  benefits,  and  (2)  a  benefit  which  is  not  a
      continuation,  without  change, of a benefit which had previously become
      payable to him or her by reason of his or her  prior  discontinuance  of
      service;  provided that nothing contained in the preceding provisions of
      this item (C) shall be construed as making item (A) of such subparagraph
      (ii) applicable to any such member who was not or is not a seven percent
      member for  actuarial  equivalent  benefit  purposes  at  such  time  of
      subsequent retirement or subsequent discontinuance of service.

      allowance (or any component thereof) which became payable to him or  her
      prior  to  such  date  of  enactment  shall  be the selection of mode of
      benefit applicable  to  the  recomputed  retirement  allowance  (or  any
      corresponding  component  thereof)  to which he or she is entitled under
      the best-of-three-computations method (as defined in subdivision  thirty
      of  this  section),  and  any such person entitled to a recomputation of
      benefits pursuant to the best-of-three-computations method shall not  be
      entitled to make any change in such selection of mode of benefit.
    
        (B)(1) Notwithstanding the provisions of item (A) of this subparagraph
      (v),  a  person  entitled to a recomputation of benefits pursuant to the
      best-of-three-computations method shall be entitled, to the  extent  and
      in  the  manner prescribed in the succeeding sub-items of this item (B),
      to  change  the  original selection of mode of benefit applicable to the
      retirement allowance (or any component thereof) which became payable  to
      him or her prior to the date of enactment of this paragraph (g).
        (2)  In  any case where the original selection of mode of benefit of a
      person  entitled  to  a  recomputation  of  benefits  pursuant  to   the
      best-of-three-computations  method  was  a  selection  of  a  joint  and
      survivor option (as defined in subdivision thirty-two of this  section),
      no  change  from  such original selection of a joint and survivor option
      may be made under this item (B)  to  any  other  selection  of  mode  of
      benefit  if  the  designated  beneficiary  selected with respect to such
      joint and survivor option by such person entitled to a recomputation  is
      not alive at the time of filing of the form whereby such person entitled
      to  a  recomputation  seeks to change, pursuant to this item (B), his or
      her original selection of such joint and survivor option.
        (3) Except for a change of selection of mode of benefit prohibited  by
      sub-item two of this item (B), any original selection of mode of benefit
      may be changed pursuant to this item (B) to another selection of mode of
      benefit, provided all of the conditions set forth in sub-items four, six
      and eight of this item (B) are met.
        (4)  Subject  to  the  provisions of sub-items seven and eight of this
      item (B), a person entitled to a recomputation of benefits  pursuant  to
      the  best-of-three-computations  method  may, pursuant to this item (B),

      mode  of benefit by executing, acknowledging and filing with the pension
      fund, within the applicable period of time prescribed by sub-item six of
      this item, a new selection of mode of benefit. If the original selection
      of mode of benefit of  the  person  filing  such  new  selection  was  a
      selection  of  a  joint and survivor option, such new selection shall be
      void and of no effect unless (a) the  designated  beneficiary  named  in
      such  original  selection  of  a  joint  and  survivor  option signs and
      acknowledges, in the form for such new selection of mode of  benefit,  a
      consent  to  such  changed  selection  of  mode of benefit, and (b) such
      original designated beneficiary is alive on the date of filing  of  such
      new selection.
        (5)  The  pension  fund  shall  mail  to  each  person  entitled  to a
      recomputation of benefits  pursuant  to  the  best-of-three-computations
      method  a  letter  showing  amounts  of benefits, as recomputed for such
      person under the best-of-three-computations method, for modes of benefit
      other than  joint  and  survivor  options,  together  with  a  statement
      advising  such  person  that  upon  request  the  amounts  of recomputed
      benefits under joint and survivor options will be provided.
        (6) The period of time within which any  such  person  entitled  to  a

      employer pick up program applicable to such member pursuant  to  section
      13-225.1  of  this  subchapter (providing for pick up of required member
      contributions), would be required by law to be deducted, on  account  of
      such member's normal rate of contribution, from the compensation of such
      member for such payroll period, after (1) giving effect to any reduction
      in    such    contributions    required    under    any    program   for
      increased-take-home-pay or pursuant to subdivision one  of  section  one
      hundred thirty-eight-b of the retirement and social security law and (2)

      or  her  contributions  pursuant  to  subdivision  c or subdivision d of
      section  13-225  of  this  subchapter  or  (iii)  any  other  cause  not
      attributable   to   the  member's  normal  rate  of  contribution  after
      reduction, if any, in such rate as described in subparagraph one of this
      paragraph (a).
        (b) If  no  deductions  on  account  of  a  member's  normal  rate  of
      contribution are required by law to be made from the compensation of any
      member  for  any  payroll  period,  such member shall not have, for such
      payroll period, any member contributions eligible for  pick  up  by  the
      employer.  The  amount of any member's member contributions eligible for
      pick up by the employer for  any  payroll  period  shall  be  determined
    
      solely on the basis of compensation paid to such member for such payroll
      period by his or her public employer. A member shall not have any member
      contributions  eligible  for pick up by the employer with respect to any
      payroll  period  for  which he or she is not paid compensation by his or
      her public employer.

      payment of investment expenses pursuant to section 13-705 of this title.
        2. If a budget has not been adopted by the  commencement  of  the  new

      paragraph one of this subdivision.
        5. (i) The pension fund shall be considered an  entity  separate  from
      the  city  of  New  York police department. The board of trustees of the
      pension fund shall work  closely  with  the  city  of  New  York  police
      department.
        (ii)  The provisions of chapter seventeen of the New York city charter
      shall continue to apply to the police pension fund and such  fund  shall
      constitute  an  agency  for  the  purposes of such chapter. The board of
    
      trustees shall not  obtain  any  legal  services  by  the  retention  of
      employees  or  by  contract unless the corporation counsel shall consent
      thereto.
        6.  All  contracts  for  goods  or services entered into by the police
      pension fund shall be procured as prescribed in chapter thirteen of  the
      New  York  city charter; provided, however, that where the provisions of
      such chapter thirteen require  action  by  the  mayor  in  regard  to  a
      particular   procurement   (except   for   mayoral  action  pursuant  to
      subdivision c of section three hundred thirty-four of the New York  city
      charter)  such  action shall not be taken by the mayor or such appointee
      of the mayor but shall  be  taken  by  the  board  of  trustees  or  the
      executive  director  pursuant  to  a  resolution adopted by the board of
      trustees delegating such authority to the executive director.
        f.  Notwithstanding  any  other  provisions  of  this   section,   any
      resolution  of  the  board  of  trustees  which  establishes a budget or
      modifies a budget pursuant to the provisions of paragraph one  or  three
      of  subdivision  e  of this section shall require the concurrence of the
      comptroller and the representative of the mayor.  This  provision  shall
      only  apply  to  this  subdivision and nothing contained herein shall be
      construed to apply to any other vote of the  board.  No  assets  of  the
      police  pension  fund  shall be drawn upon pursuant to the provisions of
      paragraph one of subdivision e of this section unless  authorized  by  a
      budget  or  budget  modification  established  by such resolution of the
      board of trustees.
        g. Employment by the police pension fund shall constitute city-service
      for the purposes of this subchapter for those employees that are members
      of the fund pursuant to section 13-215 of this subchapter; for all other
      employees, employment by the pension fund shall constitute city  service
      for  the  purposes  of  chapter  one  of  title  thirteen  of this code;
      provided, however, that nothing contained herein shall be  construed  as
      granting  membership rights in the pension fund or any retirement system
      to a contractor of such fund or such contractor's  employees.  Employees
      of  the  pension fund shall be deemed to be employees of the city of New
      York for the purposes of  chapter  thirty-five  of  the  New  York  city
      charter and title twelve of this code.
        h.  Whenever the assets of the pension fund are drawn upon pursuant to
      the provisions of paragraph one of subdivision e  of  this  section  all
      monies  so  withdrawn  shall be made a charge to be paid by the employer
      otherwise required to make contributions to the police pension  fund  no
      later  than  the  end of the fiscal year next succeeding the time period
      during which such assets were drawn upon, provided, however, that  where
      such  charge  is  for  assets  so  withdrawn in fiscal year two thousand
      four--two thousand five or in any fiscal year  thereafter,  such  charge
      shall  be  paid  by  such  employer  no later than the end of the second
      fiscal year succeeding the time period  during  which  such  assets  are
      drawn  upon.  The  actuary shall calculate such charge to be paid by the
      employer. All charges to be paid pursuant to this subdivision  shall  be
      paid  at  the  regular  rate  of  interest  utilized  by  the actuary in
      determining employer contributions to the pension fund pursuant  to  the
      provisions of paragraph two of subdivision b of section 13-638.2 of this
      title.
        i. The funds withdrawn from the pension fund shall not be utilized for
      any  purpose other than the budget established by the board of trustees.
      All expenditures of the pension fund shall be subject to  audit  by  the
      comptroller, who may make recommendations, including but not limited to,
      procedures  designed  to improve accounting and expenditure control. All
      expenditures of the pension fund shall be reported to the mayor's office
    
      of management and budget and the budgetary office of  the  city  of  New
      York police department.

      transit police force, uniformed correction force, housing police service
      and  the  uniformed  force  of  the department of sanitation immediately
      preceding service in the police  force,  credit  for  which  immediately
      preceding allowable service was or is obtained pursuant to paragraph one
      of  this  subdivision, shall be deemed to be service in the police force
      for purposes of eligibility for benefits and to determine the amount  of
      benefits under the police pension fund.

      preceding service, the date  of  completion  of  such  member's  minimum

      becomes earlier than such date would have  been  or  would  be  if  such
    
      credit for immediately preceding service had not been so acquired, there
      shall be effected with respect to such member: (i) such increase in such
      member's  normal rate of contribution, effective as of the date on which
      such  member  last became a member of the police pension fund, as may be
      necessary to reflect  such  earlier  date  of  eligibility  for  service
      retirement; and
        (ii)  the charging of such member who acquired or acquires such credit
      for  such  immediately  preceding  service  with  a  contribution   rate
      deficiency:
        (A)  which shall accrue from the date on which such member last became
      a member of the police pension fund; and
        (B) which shall be in such amount as  shall  be  the  product  of  the

      prescribed by rules and regulations adopted by the board of trustees  of
      such  pension  fund,  shall  require  an  appropriate  adjustment of any
      benefit which may become payable to or on account of such member.
        (3) Nothing contained in subparagraph (b) of  paragraph  two  of  this
      subdivision  d  shall  cause  a  member who acquires or acquired service
      credit by reason of the provisions of subparagraph (a) of such paragraph

      contributions  to  such  pension  fund  or  to a refund of or credit for
      contributions paid during a period  when  the  member  would  have  been
      entitled to terminate or reduce such contributions if he or she had such
      service  credit  on  the date when he or she last became a member of the
      pension fund; or

      system  and  whose  membership  therein  was  terminated  by such member
      attaining membership in the police pension fund, subchapter  two,  shall
      receive credit in the said police pension fund for prior creditable city
      service  by  paying  into  the  annuity  savings fund of the said police
      pension fund the amount of the employee contributions required  to  have
      been  paid  into the board of education retirement system for such prior
      creditable city service, within one year after July sixteenth,  nineteen
      hundred  sixty-five shall take effect, or within one year after becoming
      a member of the police pension fund, subchapter two, whichever is later,

      amount of  such  member's  pension  or  retirement  allowance,  provided
      however,  that  no  member  of  the  said  police  pension fund shall be
      eligible for retirement for service until he or she has  served  in  the
      police  force  for  a  minimum period of twenty or twenty-five years, or
      until he or she has reached the age  of  fifty-five,  according  to  the

      employees' retirement system while employed as a New  York  city  police
      department trainee shall receive credit in the said police pension fund,
    
      subchapter  two of this chapter, for prior creditable service in the New

      York  city  police  department police trainee by paying into the annuity
      savings fund of said police pension fund additional member contributions
      plus  interest  which  would  have been paid or credited had such member
      been a member of  the  police  pension  fund,  subchapter  two  of  this
      chapter,  from  his  or  her last date of appointment as a New York city
      police department trainee or date of membership in  the  New  York  city
      employees'  retirement system, whichever is later, provided such payment
      is made within one year after this subdivision shall  take  effect,  and
      the period of such prior service credit shall be deemed to be service in
      the  police  force  for  purposes  of  eligibility  for  benefits and to
      determine the amounts of benefits under the police pension fund.
        (2) A member of the  police  pension  fund,  subchapter  two  of  this
      chapter,  who  acquires  service  credit  by reason of the provisions of
      paragraph one of this subdivision shall be entitled to any other  right,
      benefit  or  entitlement  of a similarly situated member of such pension
      fund with equal total service credit consisting only of service  in  the
      uniformed force of the police department.

        (b)  The period of such retroactivity shall be deemed to be service in
      the police force  for  purposes  of  eligibility  for  benefits  and  to
      determine  the  amounts of benefits under the police pension fund. (2) A
      member of the police pension fund, subchapter two of this  chapter,  who
      acquires  service credit by reason of the provisions of paragraph one of
      this subdivision shall be  entitled  to  any  other  right,  benefit  or
      entitlement  of  a  similarly  situated member of such pension fund with
      equal total service credit consisting only of service in  the  uniformed
      force of the police department.
        * h.  (1) Any member of the pension fund who, prior to June thirtieth,
      nineteen hundred  ninety-two,  would  have  been  entitled  to  transfer
      membership  in  another  public  retirement  system  to the pension fund
    
      pursuant to any provision of law,  but  who  failed  to  make  a  timely
      election  to do so, may elect to transfer such membership to the pension
      fund by filing a written  request  for  such  transfer  with  the  first
      retirement  system  within  one  year  after  the effective date of this
      subdivision.
        (2) All transfers of membership to the pension fund pursuant  to  this
      subdivision  shall be in accordance with the procedures set forth in the
      transfer provisions that would have been applicable if  the  member  had
      made a timely election to transfer. Where a transfer is made pursuant to
      this  subdivision,  and  such  applicable transfer provisions would have
      required a transfer of pension reserves,  the  first  retirement  system
      shall  transfer to the pension fund all pension reserves that would have
      been transferred to the pension fund if the member  had  made  a  timely
      election to transfer.
        (3)  Service  credit  transferred to the pension fund pursuant to this
      subdivision shall be credited in  the  same  manner  and  for  the  same
      purposes  as it would have been credited if the member had made a timely
      election to transfer, and the member shall pay to the pension  fund  all
      member  contributions,  plus  interest,  which  would  have been paid or
      credited if such service credit had been transferred to the pension fund
      on the date of such member's entry into the pension fund.

      any  member  who  is  absent without pay for child care leave of absence
      pursuant to regulations of the New York city police department shall  be
      eligible  for  credit  for such period of child care leave provided such
      member files a claim for such service credit with the  pension  fund  by
      December  thirty-first, two thousand one or within ninety days following
      termination of the child care leave, whichever is later, and contributes
      to the pension fund an amount which such member would  have  contributed
      during  the  period  of  such  child  care leave, together with interest
      thereon. Service credit provided pursuant to this subdivision shall  not
      exceed  one  year  of  credit  for  each period of authorized child care
      leave. In the event there is a conflict between the provisions  of  this
      subdivision and the provisions of any other law or code to the contrary,
      the provisions of this subdivision shall govern.

        ยง 13-225 Contributions of members and their use; annuity savings fund.
      a.  (1)  The annuity savings fund shall be the fund in which there shall
      be accumulated deductions from the compensation of  members  to  provide
      for  their  annuities and their withdrawal allowances. Upon the basis of
      the tables herein authorized, and regular interest, the actuary of  such
      board  shall  determine  for  each member the proportion of compensation
      which, when deducted  from  each  payment  of  his  or  her  prospective
      earnable compensation prior to his or her eligibility for retirement and
      accumulated  at regular interest until the attainment of the minimum age
      or period of service retirement elected by him or her, shall be computed
      to provide, at that time, an annuity equal to twenty-five seventy-fifths
      of the pension then allowable to him or her for  service  as  a  member.
      Such  proportion  of  compensation shall be computed to remain constant.
      Notwithstanding the foregoing, the rate of contribution required  to  be
      made  on  and  after  October  first, nineteen hundred fifty-one, by any
      member whose rate was computed pursuant to this subdivision, as  enacted
      by  local  law  two  of  nineteen  hundred  forty,  shall be twenty-five
      forty-fifths of such prior rate.
        (2) Notwithstanding the foregoing provisions  of  paragraph  (one)  of
      this  subdivision a, the rate of contribution required to be made on and
      after the first day of the first payroll period beginning after  January
      first,  nineteen  hundred  sixty-eight by any member who became a member
      after June thirtieth, nineteen hundred forty-seven  and  prior  to  June
      thirtieth,  nineteen  hundred sixty-seven shall be his or her rate as of
      June twenty-ninth, nineteen hundred sixty-seven, as computed pursuant to
      paragraph (one) of this subdivision a, including  any  increase  thereof
      pursuant to subdivisions c and d of this section or any decrease thereof
      pursuant  to  section  13-226  of  this subchapter or subdivision one of
      section one hundred thirty-eight-b of the retirement and social security
      law, hereinafter referred to as his or her "computed prior  rate",  less
      the  difference  between  the rate which was computed for such member on
      the date he or she last became a member pursuant to paragraph  (one)  of
      the  subdivision  a,  exclusive  of  any  increase  thereof  pursuant to
      subdivisions c and d of this section or any decrease thereof pursuant to
      paragraph (one) of this subdivision or section 13-226 of this subchapter
      or pursuant to subdivision one of section one hundred thirty-eight-b  of
      the  retirement  and  social security law, and the rate which would have
      been computed for such member on the  date  he  or  she  last  became  a
      member,  pursuant  to paragraph (one) of this subdivision, had he or she
      been entitled on that  date  to  regular  interest  at  four  per  cent;
      provided  that  the  adjusted  rate of contribution computed pursuant to
      this paragraph shall be subject to change pursuant to subdivisions c and
      d of this section, section 13-226 of  this  subchapter  or  pursuant  to
      subdivision  one of section one hundred thirty-eight-b of the retirement
      and social security law.
        (3) for any member to whom the last paragraph applies,  and  beginning
      with  the  first  day  of the first payroll period commencing after June
      thirtieth, nineteen hundred sixty-seven and ending with the last day  of
      the  last payroll period before the first payroll period beginning after
      January first, nineteen hundred sixty-eight, the amount of  contribution
      paid by him or her which represents the difference between the "computed
      prior  rate" of such member and his or her adjusted rate of contribution
      as computed pursuant to paragraph (two) of this subdivision a  shall  be
      refunded  upon  the  member's  election,  or, otherwise, shall be deemed
      additional  contributions  for  the  purpose  of  purchasing  additional
      annuity,  but  such  additional  contributions  shall not enter into the
      computation for allowance on ordinary disability retirement as described
      in section 13-251 of this subchapter.
    
        b. Such board shall certify to the commissioner who shall deduct  from
      the  compensation  of  each  member  on  each and every pay roll of such
      member for each and every pay roll period, the proportion of his or  her
      earnable  compensation  so  computed.  Such  board shall not certify nor
      shall  the commissioner make any deduction for annuity purposes from the
      compensation of a member who elects not to contribute if his or her  age
      and  total service are such as would entitle a new entrant to retire for
      service on a pension not less than seventy-five per cent of one-half  of
      his  or  her final compensation. In determining the amount earnable by a
      member in a  payroll  period,  such  board  may  consider  the  rate  of
      compensation  payable  to  such  member  on the first day of the payroll
      period as continuing throughout such payroll period and such  board  may
      omit  deductions  from  compensation  for  any  period  less than a full
      payroll period if an employee was not a member on the first day  of  the
      payroll  period.  To facilitate the making of deductions, such board may
      modify the deduction required of any member by such an amount  as  shall
      not  exceed one-tenth of one per cent of the compensation upon the basis
      of which such deduction is to be made. The  deductions  provided  herein
      shall  be made notwithstanding that the minimum compensation provided by
      law for any member shall be  reduced  thereby.  Every  member  shall  be
      deemed  to  consent  and  agree  to the deductions made and provided for
      herein and shall receipt in full for his or her salary or  compensation,
      and  payment less such deductions shall be a full and complete discharge
      and acquittance of all claims and demands whatsoever  for  the  services
      rendered  by  such  person  during  the  period covered by such payment,
      except his or her claim to the benefits  to  which  he  or  she  may  be
      entitled under the provisions of this subchapter. The commissioner shall
      certify  to  the comptroller on each and every payroll the amounts to be
      deducted. Each of such amounts shall be deducted and when deducted shall
      be paid into the annuity savings fund, and shall be  credited,  together
      with regular interest, to an individual account of the member from whose
      compensation  such  deduction  was  made.  The method of computation and
      deductions prescribed by this subdivision  and  subdivision  a  of  this
      section shall be appropriately modified in the case of a member for whom
      a rate is otherwise fixed pursuant to section 13-226 of this subchapter.
        c.  In  addition  to  the computed deductions, any member may elect to
      contribute at a rate fifty per  centum  in  excess  of  that  heretofore
      provided, for the purpose of purchasing additional annuity. In computing
      the  amount  of such additional rate any modification of the normal rate
      pursuant to section 13-226 of  this  subchapter  shall  be  disregarded.
      These  additional contributions shall be credited to the annuity savings
      fund with regular interest.  Such  additional  contributions  shall  not
      enter   into  the  computation  for  allowance  on  ordinary  disability
      retirement as described in section 13-251 of this subchapter.  A  member
      may  elect  to  discontinue  his  or her additional contributions at any
      time.
        d. In  addition  to  the  deductions  from  compensation  hereinbefore
      provided,  any  member  may  redeposit  in the annuity savings fund by a
      single payment an amount equal to the  total  amount  which  he  or  she
      withdrew  previously  therefrom  as  provided in this subchapter, or any
      member may deposit therein by a single payment, or in equal installments
      over a period to be designated by such member, but  not  exceeding  five
      years, immediately prior to his or her retirement, an amount computed to
      be  sufficient  to  purchase an additional annuity, which, together with
      his or her prospective retirement allowance, will provide for him or her
      a  total  retirement  allowance  of  one-half  of  his  or   her   final
      compensation  at  the minimum age or period of retirement elected by him
      or her. Such additional amounts so deposited shall become a part of  his
    
      or  her  accumulated  deductions. The accumulated deductions of a member
      withdrawn as provided in this  subchapter  shall  be  paid  out  of  the
      annuity   savings  fund.  Upon  retirement  of  a  member,  his  or  her
      accumulated  deductions  shall  be  transferred  from  such  fund to the
      annuity reserve fund.
        e. In the case of a member receiving extra pay, salary or compensation
      for additional duties assigned to him or her, the comptroller shall make
      such semi-monthly deductions on the basis of such extra pay,  salary  or
      compensation  unless  such member shall signify in writing to the board,
      within thirty days after the first receipt thereof, his or her  election
      to have his or her benefits and obligations computed on the basis of the
      pay,  salary  or  compensation  received by him or her prior to the time
      when he or she first received such extra  compensation.  If  any  member
      receives  extra  pay,  salary  or  compensation for an aggregate or five
      years or more or for the period of time fixed by section 14-114 of  this
      code,   the   comptroller  shall  continue  to  make  such  semi-monthly
      deductions on the basis of  such  extra  pay,  salary  or  compensation,
      notwithstanding that such member does not continue to receive it, unless
      such member shall signify to the board in writing his or her election to
      have  his  or  her benefits and obligations computed on the basis of the
      pay,  salary  or  compensation  actually  received  by  him.  Additional
      deductions  so  made shall entitle such member to a retirement allowance
      on the basis of such extra pay, salary or compensation.  The  provisions
      of  this  subdivision shall not diminish or impair the benefits provided
      in subdivision c of section 14-114 of this code.

      required  to  be made for the purchase of credit for previous service or

      not be deemed to be changed  by  such  member's  particiaption  in  such
      program.
    
        (2)  Nothing contained in paragraph one of this subdivision c shall be

      provision of law which limits the salary base for  computing  retirement
      benefits payable by a public retirement system.

      rate,  for  the same time periods, in the same manner and under the same
      circumstances as interest would be required to accrue in  favor  of  the
      member  and  be  payable  by the city on such picked up contributions if
      they were made by the member in the  absence  of  an  employer  pick  up
      program applicable to such member under the provisions of this section.
        (2)  The  picked  up  member contributions of any member paid into the
      annuity savings fund by the city  pursuant  to  this  section  shall  be
      credited  to  a  separate  account within the individual account of such
      member in such fund, so that a separate record of  the  amount  of  such
      picked up contributions is maintained.
        (3)  Nothing  contained  in  this  subdivision d shall be construed as

      under  federal  law,  other  than as employer contributions, pursuant to
      subsection h of section four  hundred  fourteen  of  the  United  States
      internal   revenue  code,  for  the  federal  purposes  for  which  such
      subsection h so classifies such picked up contributions.
        e. No member whose member contributions are required to be  picked  up
      pursuant to this section shall have any right to elect that such pick up
      of  contributions,  with accompanying deduction from the compensation of

      employer  pursuant  to  this  chapter or to purchase credit for military
      service pursuant to article twenty of the retirement and social security
      law, may elect to purchase any or all of such  service  by  executing  a

      elections are permitted by the retirement system by rule or  regulation.
      Such  agreement  shall  set  forth  the  amount  of  previous service or

      this subchapter, or of any reduction thereof pursuant to subdivision one
      of  section  one  hundred  thirty-eight-b  of  the retirement and social

      or the tax imposed upon him or her pursuant  to  the  federal  insurance
      contribution act.
        b. For such period of time as the reduction pursuant to the provisions
      of subdivision a of this section shall be in effect, contributions shall

      the actuary, which shall be computed to be  sufficient  to  provide  the
      death           benefit           hereunder,           and           the
      pension-providing-for-increased-take-home-pay which are  or  may  become
      payable on account of such member.
        c.        Such        a        benefit        and        such        a
      pension-providing-for-increased-take-home-pay  shall  be  based   on   a
      reserve-for-increased-take-home-pay,  which shall be a sum consisting of
      the total of all products obtained by multiplying  the  compensation  of
      the  member,  during  each  period  of reduction of member contributions
      under this section, by  the  percentage  of  reduction  of  his  or  her
      contributions applicable under this section with respect to such period,
      plus  regular  interest  on  such  sum, and additional interest, if any,
      thereon.
        d. Where a member's rate of contribution is reduced because  the  city
      contributes  towards  the  pension-providing-for-increased-take-home-pay
      pursuant to this  section,  such  member  may  by  written  notice  duly
      acknowledged  and filed with the pension fund within one year after such
      reduction or within one year after he  or  she  last  became  a  member,
      whichever  is  later,  elect  to  waive such reduction. One year or more
      after the filing thereof, a member  may  withdraw  any  such  waiver  by
      written  notice  duly acknowledged and filed with the retirement system.
      Where a member makes an election to waive such reduction he or she shall
      contribute to the pension fund as otherwise provided in this subchapter.
        e. A member who waives a reduction of contribution  pursuant  to  this
      section  or  who  elects  or  has  elected  to  discontinue  his  or her
      contributions pursuant to  subdivision  b  of  section  13-225  of  this
      subchapter         shall         be         entitled         to        a
      pension-providing-for-increased-take-home-pay and death benefits to  the
      same extent as if such waiver or election had not been made.
        f. The benefits provided pursuant to paragraph one of subdivision a of
      this section apply only to members of the pension fund who are in active
      service  in  the  police  force  on or after the date of adoption of the
      executive order by the mayor pursuant to such paragraph one.

      to be conformably modified for such purpose.
        * NB There are two item (iv)'s
        (c) (i) Any amount required by the provisions of  items  (iii),  (iv),
      (v), (vi) and (vii) of subparagraph (a) of this paragraph and items (ii)
      and  (iv)  of  subparagraph  (b) of this paragraph and section 13-704 of

      city's  nineteen hundred eighty--nineteen hundred eighty-one fiscal year
      or any subsequent fiscal year shall be payable  with  interest  on  such
      amount  at  a rate per centum per annum equal to the rate per centum per

        (ii)  Any  amount required to be contributed to the contingent reserve
      fund in any fiscal year of  the  city  preceding  the  nineteen  hundred
      eighty--nineteen  hundred eighty-one fiscal year shall be deemed to have
      been required to be paid with interest on such  amount  at  a  rate  per

      this subparagraph (c), express the intent of  such  provisions  of  this
      subchapter or other laws requiring such payment.
        (iv)  The city shall make all payments to the pension fund required by
      applicable law in accordance with the time of payment  requirements  set
      forth  in  subdivision  c  of section 13-231 of this chapter. Commencing
      with payments due in  fiscal  year  two  thousand  twelve--two  thousand
      thirteen,  in any fiscal year in which the city does not make all or any
      portion of such required payments  to  the  pension  fund  in  a  timely
      manner,  the  city shall be required to pay interest to the pension fund
      on such overdue amounts, as determined by the actuary. The actuary shall
      determine, at such  time  as  he  or  she  deems  appropriate,  interest
      payments  on such overdue amounts using a rate of interest equivalent to
      the valuation rate of  interest  (as  defined  in  paragraph  eleven  of
      subdivision  a  of  section 13-638.2 of this title). The city shall make
      such interest payments on overdue amounts to the  pension  fund  in  the

      eleven--two  thousand  twelve,  and for each fiscal year thereafter, the
      amount of the normal contribution payable to the contingent reserve fund
      shall be determined pursuant to the provisions of  subparagraph  (e)  of
      this  paragraph. Upon the basis of the latest mortality and other tables
      herein authorized and regular interest, the actuary shall determine,  as
      of  June  thirtieth,  nineteen  hundred eighty and as of each succeeding
      June thirtieth, the amount of  the  total  liability  for  all  benefits
      provided  in  this  subchapter,  in article eleven of the retirement and
      social  security  law,  article  fourteen  of  such  law  (if  and  when
      applicable)  and  in  any  other law prescribing benefits payable by the
      pension fund on account of all members and beneficiaries, excluding  the
      liability on account of future increased-take-home-pay contributions, if
      any,  and the liability for benefits attributable to the annuity savings
      fund, provided, however, that in determining such  total  liability  for
      all  benefits  as of June thirtieth, nineteen hundred ninety-five and as
      of each succeeding June thirtieth, the actuary  shall  include  (A)  the
      liability on account of future increased-take-home-pay contributions, if
      any,  (B) the liability on account of future public employer obligations
      under the provisions  of  subdivision  twenty  of  section  two  hundred
      forty-three  of the military law, to pay in behalf of members qualifying

      of  the  military  service  of  such  members  and (C) the liability for
      benefits attributable to the annuity savings fund.
    
        (ii) For the purposes of subparagraphs (b) and (c) of  this  paragraph
      two, the actuary shall determine, as of June thirtieth, nineteen hundred
      ninety-five  and  as  of  each  succeeding  June  thirtieth,  the  total
      liability of the pension fund which shall be an amount equal to the  sum
      of  (A)  the  total liability for all benefits as determined pursuant to
      item (i) of this subparagraph and (B) the amount, as  estimated  by  the
      actuary,  of  the  total liability of the pension fund on account of all
      payments which the pension fund may be required to make for base  fiscal
      years  (as  defined  by  the  applicable  provisions of paragraph one of
      subdivision b of section 13-232.1 of this subchapter and  paragraph  one
      of subdivision b of section 13-232.3 of this subchapter) beginning on or
      after  July  first, nineteen hundred ninety-four to the police officer's
      variable supplements fund, pursuant to subdivisions d, e and f  of  such
      section   13-232.1   and  to  the  police  superior  officer's  variable
      supplements fund pursuant to subdivisions d, e and  f  of  such  section
      13-232.3.

      the purpose of calculating the amount of  the  normal  contribution  due
      from  the  city  to the contingent reserve fund pursuant to subparagraph

      six, and in each fiscal year thereafter, both the total liability of the
      pension   fund,   as  calculated  by  the  actuary  in  accordance  with
      subparagraph (a) of this paragraph, and the normal rate of contribution,
      as calculated by the actuary in accordance with subparagraph (b) of this
      paragraph, shall be determined as of June thirtieth of the second fiscal
      year preceding the fiscal year  in  which  the  normal  contribution  is
      payable,  provided,  however,  that  (i)  the actuary shall use for such
      calculations the mortality and other tables that are applicable  at  the
      time he or she performs such calculations; (ii) the total funds on hand,
      as  determined  by  the  actuary pursuant to sub-item (F) of item (i) of
      subparagraph (b) of this paragraph, shall be adjusted by adding to  such
      amount  the  present  value of all employer contributions required to be
      paid into the contingent reserve fund in the fiscal year next  preceding
      the  fiscal  year  in  which  the  normal  contribution  is  payable, as
      determined  by  the  actuary;  and  (iii)  the  present  value  of   the
      prospective  future  salaries of all members, as computed by the actuary
      for the purposes of item (ii) of subparagraph  (b)  of  this  paragraph,
      shall  be  reduced  by  the present value of the salaries expected to be
      paid to all members in the fiscal year next preceding the fiscal year in
      which the normal contribution is payable, as determined by the actuary.
        (b) The normal rate of contribution  shall  be  the  rate  per  centum
      obtained;
        (i) by deducting from the amount of such total liability the sum of;
        (A)  (1)  the  amount obtained by adding together the present value of
      all required future revised unfunded accrued liability contributions and
      the present value of  all  required  future  payments  of  the  nineteen
      hundred   eighty   unfunded  accrued  liability  adjustment,  determined
      pursuant to subparagraph (c) of paragraph three of this  subdivision  b,
      if such adjustment is a charge; or
        (2)  the  remainder  obtained by subtracting from the present value of
      all required future revised unfunded  accrued  liability  contributions,
      the  present  value  of  all future installments of the nineteen hundred
      eighty unfunded accrued liability adjustment required to be credited, if
      such nineteen hundred eighty adjustment is a credit;
        (3) minus (whether (1) or (2) of this sub-item (A) is applicable)  the
      present  value  of  all  future  installments  of  the  nineteen hundred
      eighty-two unfunded accrued liability adjustment; and

      contributions, plus, in the case of  the  determination  of  the  normal
      contribution  payable  in  fiscal year nineteen hundred eighty--nineteen
      hundred eighty-one, the present value, as of  June  thirtieth,  nineteen
      hundred  eighty,  of  the  payment  of  interest  on  the  balance sheet
      liability as required by item (v) of subparagraph (a) of  paragraph  one
      of this subdivision b; and
        (C) the present value of all future member contributions on account of
      dependent benefits; and
        (D)  the  present  value  of all required future payments, pursuant to
      section 13-704 of this title, of installments of  losses  in  excess  of
      installments  of  gains on dispositions of securities within the meaning
      of such section; and

      of the prospective future salaries of all members, as  computed  by  the
      actuary  on the basis of the latest mortality and service tables adopted
      pursuant to section 13-221 of this  subchapter,  and  on  the  basis  of
      regular  interest.  The  normal  rate  of contribution determined by the
      actuary shall not be less than zero, shall be certified by  the  actuary
      after  each  such  valuation  and shall continue in force until the next
      succeeding valuation and certification.

      contribution for each such fiscal year  as  of  June  thirtieth  of  the
      second  fiscal  year  preceding  the  fiscal  year  in which such normal
      contribution is payable, based on the latest mortality and other  tables
      applicable  at  the  time  he or she performs such calculations, and the
      valuation rate of interest as provided for the pension fund in paragraph
      two of subdivision b of section 13-638.2 of this title.
        (ii) In calculating the entry age normal contribution payable  in  any
      such  fiscal  year pursuant to this subparagraph, the actuary, in his or
      her  discretion,  may  make  certain  adjustments  in  the   calculation
      methodology,  provided  that  such adjustments are generally accepted as
      consistent with the entry age actuarial cost method, and  are  designed,
      in  general,  to  fund,  on  a level basis over the working lifetimes of
    
      members from their  ages  at  entry,  the  actuarial  present  value  of
      benefits  to  which  such  members  are  expected to become entitled, as
      determined by the actuary. Such generally accepted  adjustments  in  the
      calculation  methodology, in the discretion of the actuary, may include,
      but are not  limited  to,  the  calculation  of  the  entry  age  normal
      contribution (A) on an individual member basis by calculating the amount
      of  the  entry  age  normal contribution attributable to each individual
      member, and then adding together such individual member amounts, (B)  on
      an  aggregate  basis  for  all  members  or (C) on any combination of an
      individual member basis and an aggregate basis which is consistent  with
      the  entry  age  actuarial  cost method, and the preceding provisions of
      this item.
        (iii)  For  each  such  fiscal  year,  the  actuary,  in  his  or  her
      discretion,  shall  determine, in accordance with the provisions of item
      (ii) of this subparagraph, the methodology for calculating the entry age
      normal contribution payable for that particular fiscal year.
        (iv) The methodology determined by the actuary in accordance with item
      (iii) of this subparagraph may provide for the actuary to calculate  the
      entry  age  normal  contribution  on  an  individual member basis by (A)
      multiplying the entry age normal contribution rate for  each  individual
      member,  as determined by the actuary, by the salary expected to be paid
      to that member during the fiscal year in which such normal  contribution
      is  payable,  and  (B)  calculating  the sum of the individual entry age
      normal contributions attributable to all such members. The  actuary,  in
      his  or her discretion, may make any adjustments to such methodology for
      determining the entry age normal contribution  on  an  individual  basis
      which  he  or  she  deems appropriate, and which are consistent with the
      provisions of item (ii) of this subparagraph.
        (v) In the alternative, the methodology determined by the  actuary  in
      accordance  with  item  (iii)  of  this subparagraph may provide for the
      actuary to calculate the entry age normal contribution on  an  aggregate
      basis  by  multiplying  the  entry  age normal contribution rate for all
      members in the aggregate, as determined by the actuary, by the aggregate
      amount of the salaries expected to be paid to  all  members  during  the
      fiscal year in which the normal contribution is payable. The actuary, in
      his  or her discretion, may make any adjustments to such methodology for
      determining the entry age normal  contribution  on  an  aggregate  basis
      which  he  or  she  deems appropriate, and which are consistent with the
      provisions of item (ii) of this subparagraph.
        (vi) In the alternative, the methodology determined by the actuary  in
      accordance  with  item  (iii)  of  this subparagraph may provide for the
      calculation of the entry age normal  contribution  on  any  other  basis
      which  the  actuary  deems appropriate, and which is consistent with the
      entry age actuarial cost method and the provisions of item (ii) of  this
      subparagraph.
        (vii)   (A)  Where  the  methodology  determined  by  the  actuary  in
      accordance  with  item  (iii)  of   this   subparagraph   requires   the
      determination  of  an  entry  age  normal  contribution  rate  for  each
      individual  member  in  order  to  calculate  the   entry   age   normal
      contribution  for  each  individual  member, the actuary shall determine
      such rate for  each  such  member  in  accordance  with  the  entry  age
      actuarial  cost  method, and such rate, as determined by the actuary for
      each such member,  shall  be  consistent  with  a  method  designed,  in
      general,  to  fund,  on  a level basis over the working lifetime of that
      particular member from his or her age at entry,  the  actuarial  present
      value  of  benefits to which such member is expected to become entitled,
      as determined by the actuary.
    
        (B) Where the methodology determined by the actuary in accordance with
      item (iii) of this subparagraph requires the determination of  an  entry
      age  normal  contribution rate for all members in the aggregate in order
      to calculate the entry age normal contribution for all  members  in  the
      aggregate,  the actuary shall determine such rate in accordance with the
      entry age actuarial cost method, and such rate,  as  determined  by  the
      actuary,  shall  be  consistent  with  a method designed, in general, to
      fund, on a level basis over the working lifetimes of members from  their
      ages  at  entry,  the  actuarial present value of benefits to which such
      members are expected to become entitled, as determined by the actuary.
        (3)  Unfunded  accrued  liability  contributions.--(a)  The   original
      unfunded  accrued  liability  contribution  shall be an amount which, if
      paid to the contingent reserve fund in forty equal annual  installments,
      commencing  with  payment  of a first installment in the city's nineteen
      hundred seventy-seven--nineteen hundred seventy-eight fiscal year  would
      be the actuarial equivalent, on the basis of five and one-half percentum
      interest  and  the actuarial tables in effect as of July first, nineteen
      hundred seventy-seven, of the difference between the  accrued  liability
      excluding the liability for benefits attributable to the annuity savings
      fund  on  June  thirtieth,  nineteen  hundred seventy-five and the total
      funds on hand, excluding the amount in the  annuity  savings  fund,  but
      including  the  amount  of  any  unpaid  moneys appropriated pursuant to
      section 13-231 of this subchapter.
        (b) (i) The revised unfunded accrued liability contribution  shall  be
      an amount determined as prescribed in items (ii), (iii), (iv), (v), (vi)
      and (vii) of this subparagraph (b).
        (ii) To the amount of the difference constituting the unfunded accrued
      liability as of June thirtieth, nineteen hundred seventy-five heretofore
      determined  pursuant  to  the  provisions  of this paragraph three as in
      effect on July first, nineteen hundred  seventy-seven,  there  shall  be
      added  interest  thereon at the rate of five and one-half per centum per
      annum for the period from July first, nineteen hundred  seventy-five  to
      June thirtieth, nineteen hundred eighty.
        (iii)  (A)  There  shall  be  computed,  in the manner provided for in
      sub-item (B) of this item (iii), the discounted value  of  each  of  the
      installments  of  the  unfunded accrued liability contribution which, in
      the absence of the enactment of chapter nine hundred fifty-seven of  the
      laws  of  nineteen  hundred eighty-one, where payable or would have been
      payable in the city's nineteen hundred  seventy-seven--nineteen  hundred
      seventy-eight,    nineteen   hundred   seventy-eight--nineteen   hundred
      seventy-nine, nineteen hundred  seventy-nine--nineteen  hundred  eighty,
      nineteen   hundred  eighty--nineteen  hundred  eighty-one  and  nineteen
      hundred eighty-one--nineteen hundred eighty-two fiscal years.
        (B) Such discounted value of each such installment shall  be  computed
      as  of  January  first  of  the  city's second fiscal year preceding the
      fiscal year in which such installment was payable  or  would  have  been
      payable  and  on  the basis of five and one-half per centum interest per
      annum on the amount of such installment.
        (C) There shall be computed with respect to such discounted  value  of
      each  such  installment,  interest  thereon  from  January first of such
      second fiscal year preceding the fiscal year in which  such  installment
      was  or  would  have  been  payable  to June thirtieth, nineteen hundred
      eighty at the rate of five and one-half per centum per annum.
        (D) The discounted values of all of such installments with respect  to
      such  fiscal years, computed as provided for in sub-items (A) and (B) of
      this item (iii), together with interest  on  each  such  installment  as
      provided for in sub-item (C) of this item, shall be added together.
    
        (iv)  From the sum computed pursuant to item (ii) of this subparagraph
      (b), the sum computed pursuant to item (iii) of this subparagraph  shall
      be subtracted.
        (v)  With respect to each city fiscal year occurring during the period
      beginning on July first, nineteen hundred  eighty  and  ending  on  June
      thirtieth,  nineteen  hundred  eighty-two,  the revised unfunded accrued
      liability contribution shall be the annual  installment,  applicable  to
      such  fiscal year, of an amount which, if paid to the contingent reserve
      fund in thirty-five equal annual installments, commencing  with  payment
      of  a  first installment in the city's nineteen hundred eighty--nineteen
      hundred eighty-one fiscal year, would be the  actuarial  equivalent,  on
      the  basis  of  seven and one-half per centum interest per annum, of the
      remainder computed pursuant to item (iv) of this subparagraph.
        (vi) With respect to each city fiscal year occurring during the period
      beginning on July first, nineteen hundred eighty-two and ending on  June
      thirtieth,  nineteen  hundred eighty-eight, the revised unfunded accrued
      liability contribution shall be the annual  installment,  applicable  to
      such  fiscal year, of an amount which, if paid to the contingent reserve
      fund in thirty-three equal annual installments, commencing with  payment
      of    a    first    installment   in   the   city's   nineteen   hundred
      eighty-two--nineteen hundred eighty-three  fiscal  year,  would  be  the
      actuarial  equivalent,  on  the  basis  of eight per centum interest per
      annum, of the present value, as  of  June  thirtieth,  nineteen  hundred
      eighty-two  on  the  basis of seven and one-half per centum interest per
      annum,  of  those  installments  of  the  unfunded   accrued   liability
      contribution  computed  pursuant  to  item (v) of this subparagraph (b),
      which installments are hypothetically allocated  by  such  item  (v)  to
      designated city fiscal years succeeding June thirtieth, nineteen hundred

        (vii)  With  respect  to  each  city  fiscal year occurring during the
      period beginning on July first, nineteen hundred eighty-eight and ending
      on June thirtieth, two thousand fifteen, the  revised  unfunded  accrued
      liability  contribution  shall  be the annual installment, applicable to
      such fiscal year, of an  amount  which,  when  paid  to  the  contingent
      reserve  fund in twenty-seven equal annual installments, commencing with
      payment  of  a  first  installment  in  the  city's   nineteen   hundred
      eighty-eight--nineteen  hundred  eighty-nine  fiscal  year, shall be the
      actuarial equivalent, on the basis of eight and one-quarter  per  centum
      interest per annum, of the present value, as of June thirtieth, nineteen
      hundred  eighty-eight  on  the  basis  of  eight per centum interest per
      annum,  of  those  installments  of  the  unfunded   accrued   liability
      contribution  computed  pursuant  to item (vi) of this subparagraph (b),
      which installments are hypothetically allocated by  such  item  (vi)  to
      designated city fiscal years succeeding June thirtieth, nineteen hundred
      eighty-eight.
        (c)  (i)  The  nineteen  hundred  eighty  unfunded  accrued  liability
      adjustment shall be an amount determined as prescribed  in  items  (ii),
      (iii), (iv) and (v) of this subparagraph (c).
        (ii)  (A)  Upon the basis of the actuarial tables in effect as of June
      thirtieth, nineteen hundred eighty, for valuation purposes and  interest
      at  the  rate of seven and one-half per centum per annum, there shall be
      determined, as of June thirtieth, nineteen hundred eighty, the amount of
      the total liability for all benefits provided  in  this  subchapter,  in
      article  eleven  of  the  retirement and social security law, in article
      fourteen of the retirement and social security law (if  applicable)  and
      in  any  other  law  prescribing benefits payable by the pension fund on
      account of all members and beneficiaries,  excluding  the  liability  on
    
      account of future increased-take-home-pay contributions, if any, and the
      liability for benefits attributable to the annuity savings fund.
        (B)  From  such  total  liability computed pursuant to sub-item (A) of
      this item (ii), there shall be subtracted the sum of:
        (1) the present value, as of June thirtieth, nineteen hundred  eighty,
      of all future normal costs of the pension fund, computed pursuant to the
      entry age normal cost method of determining such normal costs; and
        (2)  the  present  value,  as  of  such  June thirtieth, of all future
      installments of the balance sheet liability contribution (as defined  in
      paragraph four of this subdivision b); and
        (3) the present value, as of such June thirtieth, of all then required
      future   payments,   pursuant  to  section  13-704  of  this  title,  of
      installments  of  losses  in  excess  of  installments   of   gains   on
      dispositions of securities within the meaning of such section; and

      contributions of members, if any, subject to  article  fourteen  of  the
      retirement and social security law; and
        (5)  the  total funds on hand as of such June thirtieth, excluding the
      amount in the annuity savings fund, but  including  the  amount  of  any
      unpaid   moneys   appropriated   pursuant  to  section  13-231  of  this
      subchapter.
        (iii) (A) If the amount computed pursuant to sub-item (B) of item (ii)
      of this subparagraph (c) is larger than the amount computed pursuant  to
      item  (iv)  of subparagraph (b) of this paragraph (3), the latter amount
      shall be subtracted from the former amount and the  remainder  resulting
      from such subtraction shall constitute a charge.
        (B)  If  the  amount computed pursuant to sub-item (B) of item (ii) of
      this subparagraph (c) is smaller than the amount  computed  pursuant  to
      item (iv) of subparagraph (b) of this paragraph, the former amount shall
      be  subtracted  from  the latter amount and the remainder resulting from
      such subtraction shall constitute a credit.
        (iv) (A) If the remainder computed pursuant  to  item  (iii)  of  this
      subparagraph  is  a charge, the nineteen hundred eighty unfunded accrued
      liability adjustment shall be an amount which, if paid to the contingent
      reserve fund  in  thirty  equal  annual  installments,  commencing  with
      payment   of   a  first  installment  in  the  city's  nineteen  hundred
      eighty--nineteen hundred eighty-one fiscal year, would be the  actuarial
      equivalent,  on  the basis of seven and one-half per centum interest per
      annum, of such remainder.
        (B)  If  the  remainder  computed  pursuant  to  item  (iii)  of  this
      subparagraph  is  a credit, the nineteen hundred eighty unfunded accrued
      liability adjustment shall be an amount which,  if  credited  in  thirty
      equal  annual  installments  (the  first  of which installments is to be
      credited  in  the  city's  nineteen  hundred  eighty--nineteen   hundred
      eighty-one  fiscal year) in reduction of the amount which the city would
      otherwise be required to pay to the contingent reserve fund pursuant  to
      items  (i),  (iii),  (iv),  (v),  (vi)  and (vii) of subparagraph (a) of
      paragraph (1) of this subdivision b or otherwise pursuant to law,  would
      be  the  actuarial  equivalent,  on  the basis of seven and one-half per
      centum interest per annum, of such remainder.
        (v) (A) With respect to determination of the amount  of  contributions
      payable  to  the  contingent reserve fund in each of the city's nineteen
      hundred  eighty--nineteen  hundred  eighty-one  and   nineteen   hundred
      eighty-one--nineteen   hundred   eighty-two  fiscal  years,  the  annual
      installment of the nineteen hundred eighty  unfunded  accrued  liability
      adjustment  computed  pursuant  to  item  (iv) of this subparagraph (c),
      which installment is applicable to such fiscal year, shall be applied as
    
      a charge or  a  credit,  as  the  case  may  be,  in  relation  to  such
      contributions payable in such fiscal year.
        (B)  With  respect  to  determination  of  the amount of contributions
      payable to  the  contingent  reserve  fund  in  each  city  fiscal  year
      occurring  during  the  period beginning on July first, nineteen hundred
      eighty-two and ending on June thirtieth, nineteen hundred  eighty-eight,
      the  nineteen hundred eighty unfunded accrued liability adjustment shall
      be an amount which, if paid (if a charge) or credited (if a  credit)  in
      twenty-eight  equal  annual  installments,  commencing with a payment or
      credit,  as  the  case  may  be,  in   the   city's   nineteen   hundred
      eighty-two--nineteen  hundred  eighty-three  fiscal  year,  would be the
      actuarial equivalent, on the basis of  eight  per  centum  interest  per
      annum,  of  the  present  value,  as of June thirtieth, nineteen hundred
      eighty-two on the basis of seven and one-half per  centum  interest  per
      annum,  of  those  installments  of the nineteen hundred eighty unfunded
      accrued liability adjustment computed pursuant  to  item  (iv)  of  this
      subparagraph  (c),  which  installments  are hypothetically allocated by

      thirtieth, nineteen hundred eighty-two.
        (C)  With  respect  to  determination  of  the amount of contributions
      payable to  the  contingent  reserve  fund  in  each  city  fiscal  year
      occurring   during   the   period  beginning  on  July  first,  nineteen
      eighty-eight and  ending  on  June  thirtieth,  two  thousand  ten,  the
      nineteen  hundred  eighty unfunded accrued liability adjustment shall be
      an amount which, when paid (if a charge) or credited (if  a  credit)  in
      twenty-two  equal  annual  installments,  commencing  with  a payment or
      credit,  as  the  case  may  be,  in   the   city's   nineteen   hundred

      shall  be determined, as of June thirtieth, nineteen hundred eighty-two,
      the amount of the actuarial  accrued  liability  of  the  pension  fund,
      computed  pursuant  to  the entry age normal cost method of ascertaining
      such actuarial accrued liability.
        (iii) Upon the basis of the actuarial tables  in  effect  as  of  June
      thirtieth,  nineteen  hundred  eighty-two  for  valuation  purposes  and

        (iv)  With  respect  to  determination  of the amount of contributions
      payable to  the  contingent  reserve  fund  in  each  city  fiscal  year

      eighty-two and ending on June thirtieth, nineteen hundred  eighty-eight,
      the  nineteen  hundred  eighty-two unfunded accrued liability adjustment
      shall  be  an  amount  which,  if  credited  in  thirty   equal   annual

      year) in reduction of the amounts which  the  city  would  otherwise  be
      required  to  pay  to the contingent reserve fund pursuant to items (i),

        (ii) Upon the basis of the actuarial tables in  effect  for  valuation
      purposes  with  respect  to  determination  of  the  normal contribution
      payable to the contingent reserve fund in the  city's  nineteen  hundred
      eighty-four--nineteen  hundred  eighty-five  fiscal year and interest at
      the rate of eight per centum per annum, there shall be determined, as of
      June  thirtieth,  nineteen  hundred  eighty-five,  the  amount  of   the
      actuarial  accrued  liability  of the pension fund, computed pursuant to
      the entry age normal cost method of ascertaining such actuarial  accrued
      liability.
        (iii)  Upon  the basis of the actuarial tables in effect for valuation
      purposes with  respect  to  determination  of  the  normal  contribution
      payable  to  the  contingent reserve fund in the city's nineteen hundred
      eighty-five--nineteen hundred eighty-six fiscal year and interest at the
      rate of eight per centum per annum, there shall  be  determined,  as  of
      June   thirtieth,  nineteen  hundred  eighty-five,  the  amount  of  the
      actuarial accrued liability of the pension fund,  computed  pursuant  to
    
      the  entry age normal cost method of ascertaining such actuarial accrued
      liability.
        (iv)  (A)  The nineteen hundred eighty-five unfunded accrued liability
      adjustment, for each  city  fiscal  year  occurring  during  the  period
      beginning on July first, nineteen hundred eighty-five and ending on June
      thirtieth,  nineteen  hundred  eighty-eight, shall be an amount which if
      paid to the contingent reserve fund in thirty equal annual installments,
      commencing with payment of a first installment in  the  city's  nineteen
      hundred  eighty-five--nineteen  hundred eighty-six fiscal year, would be
      the actuarial equivalent, on the basis of eight per centum interest  per
      annum,  of  the  excess of the amount computed pursuant to item (iii) of
      this subparagraph (e) over the amount computed pursuant to item (ii)  of
      this subparagraph.
        (B)  The  nineteen  hundred  eighty-five  unfunded  accrued  liability
      adjustment for  each  city  fiscal  year  occurring  during  the  period
      beginning  on  July  first,  nineteen hundred eighty-eight and ending on
      June thirtieth, two thousand fifteen, shall be  an  amount  which,  when
      paid  to  the  contingent  reserve  fund  in  equal annual installments,
      commencing with payment of a first installment in  the  city's  nineteen
      hundred eighty-eight--nineteen hundred eighty-nine fiscal year, shall be
      the  actuarial  equivalent,  on  the  basis of eight and one-quarter per
      centum interest per  annum,  of  the  present  value,  as  of  the  June
      thirtieth,  nineteen  hundred  eighty-eight  on  the  basis of eight per
      centum interest per annum, of those installments of the unfunded accrued
      liability adjustment computed pursuant to  sub-item  (A)  of  this  item
      (iv),  which  installments are hypothetically allocated by such sub-item
      (A) to designated city fiscal years succeeding June thirtieth,  nineteen
      hundred eighty-eight.
        (4)  (a)  As  used  in  this section, the following words and phrases,
      unless a different meaning is plainly required  by  the  context,  shall
      have the following meanings:
        (i)  (A)  "Normal  contribution for balance sheet liability purposes".
      The hypothetical amount which the normal contribution  payable  in  each
      city  fiscal  year  occurring during the period beginning on July first,
      nineteen hundred seventy-four and ending  on  June  thirtieth,  nineteen
      hundred  eighty would have equalled if such normal contribution had been
      required by law to be paid to the contingent reserve fund  in  the  city
      fiscal year in which the obligation to make such normal contribution had
      been  required  by  law  to  be determined in the manner provided for in
      sub-items (B), (C) and (D) of this item (i).
        (B) Upon the basis of the mortality and other tables  effective  under
      this  subchapter  as  of  July first, nineteen hundred seventy-seven and
      interest at the rate of five and one-half  per  centum  per  annum,  the
      actuary  shall  determine, as of June thirtieth next preceding each such
      fiscal year for which  such  normal  contribution  is  being  determined
      (hereinafter referred to as the "subject fiscal year") the amount of the
      then  total  liability  for all benefits provided in this subchapter, in
      article eleven of the retirement and social security law, in  any  other
      law prescribing benefits payable by the pension fund in article fourteen
      of  such  law  (if applicable) and in any other law prescribing benefits
      payable by  the  pension  fund  on  account  of  all  then  members  and
      beneficiaries,  excluding the then liability on account of future annual
      contributions, for balance  sheet  liability  purposes,  on  account  of
      reserves-for-increased-take-home-pay  (as  defined  in item (iv) of this
      subparagraph  (a),  if  any,  and  the  then  liability   for   benefits
      attributable to the annuity savings fund.
        (C)  The  hypothetical normal rate of contribution with respect to the
      subject fiscal year shall be the rate per centum obtained:
    
        (1) by deducting from the amount of such total liability the sum of:
        (A)  the  present  value  of all then required future unfunded accrued
      liability contributions for balance sheet liability purposes (as defined
      in item (ii) of this subparagraph (a)); and
        (B)  the  present  value  of   all   then   required   future   annual
      contributions,  for  balance  sheet  liability  purposes,  on account of
      amortization of losses on dispositions of certain securities within  the
      meaning  of  section  13-704  of this title (as defined in item (iii) of
      this subparagraph (a)); and
        (C) the present value of future member contributions  of  members,  if
      any,  subject  to article fourteen of the retirement and social security
      law; and
        (D) the amount obtained by adding together the  total  funds  on  hand
      (excluding  therefrom  the  amount  in the annuity savings fund) and the
      balance sheet liability as of such June  thirtieth  next  preceding  the
      subject fiscal year; and
        (2)  by  dividing  the remainder by one per centum of the then present
      value of the prospective future salaries of all members, as computed  on
      the  basis  of  the  mortality  and  service  tables adopted pursuant to
      section 13-221 of this subchapter and in effect on July first,  nineteen
      hundred  seventy-seven, and on the basis of interest at the rate of five
      and one-half per centum per annum.
        (D) The amount of the normal contribution for balance sheet  liability
      purposes  hypothetically payable in the subject fiscal year shall be the
      amount obtained (1) by multiplying such hypothetical normal contribution
      rate computed with respect to the subject fiscal year by  the  aggregate
      annual  salaries  of  the  members  as  of June thirtieth of the subject
      fiscal year and (2) by adding to the  product  of  such  multiplication,
      interest on such product at the rate of five and one-half per centum per
      annum for a period of six months.
        (ii)  "Unfunded  accrued  liability  contribution  for  balance  sheet
      liability purposes". (A) With respect to  the  city's  nineteen  hundred
      seventy-four--nineteen hundred seventy-five fiscal year, such term shall
      mean a hypothetical amount which, if paid to the contingent reserve fund
      in  forty  equal  annual installments, beginning with payment of a first
      installment  in  the  city's  nineteen  hundred   seventy-four--nineteen
      hundred  seventy-five fiscal year, would be the actuarial equivalent, on
      the basis of interest at the rate of five and one-half  per  centum  per
      annum,  of  the remainder computed in the manner prescribed by sub-items
      (B) and (C) of this item (ii).
        (B) Upon the basis of the actuarial tables in effect as of July first,
      nineteen hundred seventy-seven for valuation purposes  and  interest  at
      the  rate  of  five  and  one-half  per centum per annum, there shall be
      computed, as of  June  thirtieth,  nineteen  hundred  seventy-four,  the
      amount  of  the  total  liability  for  all  benefits  provided  by this
      subchapter, in article eleven of the retirement and social security  law
      and in any other law prescribing benefits payable by the pension fund on
      account  of  all  members  and beneficiaries, excluding the liability on
      account  of  future  increased-take-home-pay   contributions   and   the
      liability for benefits attributable to the annuity savings fund.
        (C)  From  such  total  liability computed pursuant to sub-item (B) of
      this item (ii) there shall be subtracted the sum of:
        (1)  the  present  value,  as  of  June  thirtieth,  nineteen  hundred
      seventy-four,  of  all future normal costs of the pension fund, computed
      pursuant to the entry age normal cost method of determining such  normal
      cost; and
        (2) the present value, as of such June thirtieth, of all then required
      future  payments,  pursuant  to section 13-704 of this title (as then in
    
      effect), of installments of losses in excess of installments of gains on
      dispositions of securities within the meaning of such section; and
        (3) the sum obtained by adding together the balance sheet liability as
      of  such June thirtieth (as such liability is determined pursuant to the
      provisions of subparagraph (b) of this paragraph  four)  and  the  total
      funds  on  hand  as  of such June thirtieth, excluding the amount in the
      annuity savings fund, but including the  amount  of  any  unpaid  moneys
      appropriated pursuant to section 13-231 of this subchapter.
        (D)  With  respect to each of the city's fiscal years occurring during
      the period from  July  first,  nineteen  hundred  seventy-five  to  June
      thirtieth,  nineteen hundred eighty, such term shall mean a hypothetical
      amount which, if paid to the contingent  reserve  fund  in  forty  equal
      annual  installments,  beginning  with payment of a first installment in
      the city's nineteen hundred seventy-five--nineteen  hundred  seventy-six
      fiscal year, would be the actuarial equivalent, on the basis of interest
      at  the rate of five and one-half per centum per annum, of the remainder
      computed pursuant to sub-items (E) and (F) of this item (ii).
        (E) Upon the basis of the actuarial tables in effect as of July first,
      nineteen hundred seventy-seven for valuation purposes  and  interest  at
      the  rate  of  five  and  one-half  per centum per annum, there shall be
      computed, as of  June  thirtieth,  nineteen  hundred  seventy-five,  the
      amount of the total liability for all benefits provided by this chapter,
      in  article  eleven of the retirement and social security law and in any
      other law prescribing benefits  payable  by  the  retirement  system  on
      account  of  all  members  and beneficiaries, excluding the liability on
      account  of  future  increased-take-home-pay   contributions   and   the
      liability for benefits attributable to the annuity savings fund.
        (F)  From  such  total  liability computed pursuant to sub-item (E) of
      this item (ii), there shall be subtracted the sum of:
        (1)  the  present  value,  as  of  June  thirtieth,  nineteen  hundred
      seventy-five,  of  all future normal costs of the pension fund, computed
      pursuant to the entry age normal cost method of determining such  normal
      costs; and
        (2) the present value, as of such June thirtieth, of all then required
      future  payments,  pursuant  to section 13-704 of this title (as then in
      effect), of installments of losses in excess of installments of gains on
      dispositions of securities within the meaning of such section; and
        (3) the sum obtained by adding together the balance sheet liability as
      of such June thirtieth (as such liability is determined pursuant to  the
      provisions  of  subparagraphs  (c)  to  (i) inclusive, of this paragraph
      four) and the total funds on hand, as of such June thirtieth,  excluding
      the  amount in the annuity savings fund, but including the amount of any
      unpaid  moneys  appropriated  pursuant  to  section   13-231   of   this
      subchapter.
        (iii)  "Annual  contribution, for balance sheet liability purposes, on
      account of amortization of losses on dispositions of certain  securities
      within  the  meaning  of  section  13-704 of this title". A hypothetical

      hundred  eighty, of the amount of the excess of installments (payable in
      such year) of losses on prior  dispositions  of  securities  within  the
      meaning   of   section  13-704  of  this  title  over  the  installments
      (creditable in such year) of gains on  such  prior  dispositions,  which

      h of such section 13-704 of this title.

      in relation to the same dispositions of securities.
        (b) The balance sheet liability as of June thirtieth, nineteen hundred
      seventy-four  shall  be  the sum of two hundred fifty-two million, three

      with  payment  of  a  first  installment  in the city's nineteen hundred
      eighty-one--nineteen  hundred  eighty-two  fiscal  year,  would  be  the
      actuarial equivalent, as of June thirtieth, nineteen hundred eighty-one,

      fiscal  year.  If  such  equity  experience  factor is greater than such
      interest comparison factor, the difference  between  the  two  shall  be
      expressed  as a positive quantity. If such interest comparison factor is
      greater than such equity experience factor, the difference  between  the
      two shall be expressed as a negative quantity.
        5.  (a) "Equity experience factor". An amount (expressed as a positive

      loss,  in  determining  whether  such  sale produced a capital gain or a
      capital loss and the amount thereof.

      the amount of interest  which  would  have  been  hypothetically  earned
      during  such fiscal year, under the methods of calculation prescribed in
      this subparagraph seven, if an  amount  equal  to  such  investment  had
      instead been hypothetically invested in fixed income securities and such

      would  have  been  earned by the pension fund on such hypothetical fixed
      income securities during the base fiscal year shall be deemed to be  the
      amount obtained:
        (i)  by  multiplying  the  amount  of  the  investment in such equity,
      determined as prescribed by subparagraph (c) of this paragraph seven, by
      the assumed rate of interest for the base fiscal year; and
        (ii) by prorating the interest so computed,  in  any  case  where  the
      investment  in such equity was maintained by the pension fund for a part
      of the base fiscal year.

      investments of the pension fund in fixed income securities  during  such
      fiscal year.
        (b)  The  board shall fix the assumed rate of interest with respect to
      each base fiscal year. In the event of a tie vote with  respect  to  the

      earnings with respect to such year, over the amount which such  earnings
      would  be if they have been computed on the basis of an interest rate of
      six per cent, rather than on the basis of the assumed rate of  interest;
      provided,  however,  that there shall be no six per cent interest offset
      with respect to any base  fiscal  year  unless  the  hypothetical  fixed
      income  securities earnings with respect to such fiscal year exceeds the
      equity experience factor with respect to such fiscal year; and  provided
      further  that  no  six per cent interest offset with respect to any base
      fiscal year shall in any event exceed the amount obtained by subtracting
      the equity experience factor with respect to such fiscal year  from  the
      hypothetical  fixed  income  securities  earnings  with  respect to such
      fiscal year.
        10. "Interest comparison factor". In relation to any base fiscal year,
      the amount obtained by subtracting the six per cent interest offset,  if
      any,  with  respect  to  such  fiscal  year, from the hypothetical fixed
      income securities earnings with respect to such fiscal year.
        11. "Cumulative earnings differential for the base  fiscal  year".  In
      relation  to  a base fiscal year, the amount (expressed as a positive or

        (h)  The  equity  experience factor for such base fiscal year shall be
      the amount remaining after the adjustment  prescribed  by  subparagraphs
      (f) and (g) of this paragraph has been made.
        5.  "Hypothetical fixed income securities earnings". (a) The aggregate
      of the hypothetical interest yields computed pursuant  to  subparagraphs
      (b), (c) and (d) of this paragraph five.
        (b)  The  board  shall compute with respect to each investment made or
      maintained by the pension fund in an equity during the base fiscal year,
      the amount of interest  which  would  have  been  hypothetically  earned
      during  such fiscal year, under the methods of calculation prescribed in
      this paragraph five, if an amount equal to such investment  had  instead
      been  hypothetically  invested  in  fixed  income  securities  and  such
      securities had been held by such fund for a period (in the  base  fiscal
      year)  co-extensive with the period during which such equity was held by
      such fund in the base fiscal year.
    
        (c) For  the  purposes  of  this  section,  the  amount  of  any  such
      investment  in  an equity during the base fiscal year shall be deemed to
      be:
        (i) the market value of the equity on the first day of the base fiscal
      year,  in the case of any such equity acquired by the pension fund prior
      to the commencement of such fiscal year and held by  such  fund  on  the
      first day of such fiscal year; and
        (ii)  the  total  amount  paid  by  such  fund  to acquire the equity,
      including but not limited to broker's commissions and other expenses  of
      such  acquisition,  in  the case of any such equity which is acquired by
      such fund during the base fiscal year.
        (d) For the purposes of this section, the  amount  of  interest  which
      would  have  been  earned by the pension fund on such hypothetical fixed
      income securities during the base fiscal year shall be deemed to be  the
      amount obtained:
        (i)  by  multiplying  the  amount  of  the  investment in such equity,
      determined as prescribed by subparagraph (c) of this paragraph five,  by
      the assumed rate of interest for the base fiscal year; and
        (ii)  by  prorating  the  interest  so computed, in any case where the
      investment in such equity was maintained by the pension fund for a  part
      of the base fiscal year; and
        (iii) by multiplying the amount of interest computed for the full base
      fiscal  year  pursuant  to  items (i) and (ii) of this subparagraph by a
      fraction, the numerator of which is the amount designated as the  equity
      experience  factor with respect to such base fiscal year by subparagraph
      (h) of paragraph four of this subdivision b and the denominator of which
      is the remainder produced by the subtraction prescribed by  subparagraph
      (d) of such paragraph four with respect to such base fiscal year; and
        (iv)  by  adding  together  the  products  of all such multiplications
      performed pursuant to item (iii) of this subparagraph in relation to all
      such equities held by the pension fund during such fiscal year.
        6. "Cumulative earnings factor". (a) The  cumulative  earnings  factor
      for any base fiscal year shall be determined as follows:
        (i)  If  the  cumulative earnings factor for the immediately preceding
      base fiscal year was a positive quantity, the cumulative earnings factor
      for the base fiscal year shall be equal to the earnings differential for
      the base fiscal year.
        (ii) If the cumulative earnings factor for the  immediately  preceding
      base fiscal year was a negative quantity, the cumulative earnings factor
      for the base fiscal year shall be equal to the sum of:
        (A) the earnings differential for the base fiscal year; and
        (B)  the cumulative earnings factor for the immediately preceding base
      fiscal year.
        (b) In applying the provisions of this subdivision six  for  the  base
      fiscal   year   nineteen   hundred   eighty-eight  --  nineteen  hundred
      eighty-nine, the term defined in paragraph three of this  subdivision  b
      as  "cumulative  earnings  factor as of June thirtieth, nineteen hundred
      eighty-eight" shall be substituted for  the  term  "cumulative  earnings
      factor for the immediately preceding base fiscal year".

      fiscal year, the amount obtained by multiplying the cumulative  earnings
      factor  for  such base fiscal year by a fraction, the numerator of which
      shall be the total contributions made to the pension fund  with  respect
      to such base fiscal year on behalf of all members of the uniformed force
      of  the  police  department  who are police superior officers, as of the
      last day of such base fiscal year, and the denominator of which shall be

      base  fiscal  year  on  behalf  of  all  persons  who are members of the
    
      uniformed force of the police department as of the last day of such base
      fiscal year.

      board  shall  compute the PSOVSF cumulative earnings factor with respect
      to such base fiscal year.
        d. If the PSOVSF cumulative earnings factor for the base  fiscal  year
      is   a  positive  quantity,  the  pension  fund,  on  or  before  August
      thirty-first of the current fiscal year, shall pay from  its  contingent
      reserve  fund to the police superior officers' variable supplements fund
      a sum equal to the amount of such factor.

      data as it may request for the purpose of carrying out the provisions of
      this section.

      variable  supplements  fund  by the actuary pursuant to subdivision e of
      section 13-280 of this chapter shows that for any base fiscal year, such
      liabilities exceed  such  assets,  the  term  "PSOVSF  unfunded  accrued
      liability"  shall mean the amount of the excess of such liabilities over
      the amount of such assets for such base fiscal year.
        (8) "Police superior officers". Members of the uniformed force of  the
      police  department who (a) hold the position of sergeant or any position

      chapter. The amount so allowed shall be due and payable to  such  funds,
      and shall be annually credited thereto by such board.
        b.   The  investment  earnings  of  the  retirement  system  shall  be
      determined for the calendar year nineteen  hundred  sixty-four.  To  the
      extent that such earnings are in excess of the amount allowed as regular
      interest  for calendar year nineteen hundred sixty-four, the board shall
      declare a rate of special interest, expressed to the lower one-tenth  of
      one  per  centum,  but not to exceed one per centum, to be determined by
      the amount by which the investment earnings exceed the  amount  required
      for  the  allowance  of  regular  interest divided by the aggregate mean
      amount for the calendar year nineteen hundred sixty-four in the  annuity
      savings  funds  of members who are allowed regular interest at three per
      centum per annum for calendar year nineteen hundred sixty-four.  Special
      interest, as determined by multiplying said special interest rate by the
      mean  amount  for  the  calendar year nineteen hundred sixty-four in the
      individual annuity savings funds of  persons  who  are  allowed  regular
      interest  at  three  per  centum  per  annum  for calendar year nineteen
      hundred sixty-four,  shall  be  credited  as  of  December  thirty-first
      nineteen  hundred  sixty-four to the individual annuity savings funds of
      persons who are members, with a balance, after adjustment,  as  of  June
      thirtieth,  nineteen  hundred  sixty-five  and  who  are allowed regular
      interest at the rate of three per centum per  annum  for  calendar  year

      of  special  interest  which  would  have  been  credited as of December
      thirty-first, nineteen hundred sixty-four had  they  had  a  balance  in
      their  annuity  savings  funds  as  of  June thirtieth, nineteen hundred
      sixty-five, provided that the sum  of  said  special  interest  and  any
      additional  interest  to be paid pursuant to subdivision c hereof is ten
      dollars or more. Special interest shall not be considered in determining
      rates of contribution of members.
        c. If the full one per centum of special interest  has  been  allowed,
      then  to  the extent that the amount of said earnings exceeds the amount
      allowed as regular interest and the amount allowed or  paid  as  special
      interest,  the  board  shall  declare  a  rate  of  additional interest,
      expressed to the lower one-tenth of one per centum, but  not  to  exceed
      one  per  centum, to be determined by the amount by which the investment
      earnings exceed the sum of the allowance of  regular  interest  and  the
      allowance  and payment of special interest divided by the aggregate mean
      amount for calendar year nineteen hundred sixty-four which would be  the
      reserve-for-increased-take-home-pay  of  all  members  to  whom  special
      interest is  credited  or  paid  pursuant  to  paragraph  b  hereof.  In

      reserve-for-increased-take-home-pay  shall  be  included.  However,  for
      members  who  are allowed regular interest at three per centum per annum

      one per centum, but not to exceed one per centum, to  be  determined  by
      the  amount  by which the investment earnings exceed the amount required
      for the allowance of regular interest  divided  by  the  aggregate  mean
      amount  for the calendar year nineteen hundred sixty-five in the annuity
      savings funds of members who are allowed regular interest at  three  per
      centum  per annum for calendar year nineteen hundred sixty-five. Special

      mean amount for the calendar year nineteen  hundred  sixty-five  in  the
      individual  annuity  savings  funds  of  persons who are allowed regular
      interest at three per  centum  per  annum  for  calendar  year  nineteen

      calendar year nineteen hundred sixty-five and who do not have a balance,
      after  adjustment,  in their annuity savings funds as of June thirtieth,
      nineteen hundred sixty-six, a payment shall be made equal to the  amount
      of  special  interest  which  would  have  been  credited as of December
      thirty-first, nineteen hundred sixty-five had  they  had  a  balance  in
      their  annuity  savings  funds  as  of  June thirtieth, nineteen hundred
      sixty-six, provided that the  sum  of  said  special  interest  and  any
      additional  interest  to be paid pursuant to subdivision e hereof is ten

      rates of contribution of members.
        e. If the full one per centum of special interest  has  been  allowed,
      then  to  the extent that the amount of said earnings exceeds the amount
      allowed as regular interest and the amount allowed or  paid  as  special
      interest,  the  board  shall  declare  a  rate  of  additional interest,
      expressed to the lower one-tenth of one per centum, but  not  to  exceed
      one  per  centum, to be determined by the amount by which the investment
      earnings exceed the sum of the allowance of  regular  interest  and  the
      allowance  and payment of special interest divided by the aggregate mean
      amount for calendar year nineteen hundred sixty-five which would be  the
      reserve-for-increased-take-home-pay  of  all  members  to  whom  special
      interest is credited or  paid  pursuant  to  subdivision  d  hereof.  In
      determining  the  reserve-for-increased-take-home-pay  of  any member to

      additional interest for calendar year nineteen hundred sixty-five  shall
    
      not  be  included  in  the  retirement allowance, but shall be paid in a
      single payment provided that the sum of said additional interest and any

      dollars  or  more.  Additional  interest  shall  not  be  considered  in
      determining rates of contribution of members.
        f.  The  investment  earnings  of  the  retirement  system  shall   be
      determined  for  the  calendar  year  nineteen hundred sixty-six. To the
      extent that such earnings are in excess of the amount allowed as regular

      declare  a rate of special interest, expressed to the lower one-tenth of
      one per centum, but not to exceed one per centum, to  be  determined  by
      the  amount  by which the investment earnings exceed the amount required
      for the allowance of regular interest  divided  by  the  aggregate  mean

      earnings exceed the sum of the allowance of  regular  interest  and  the
      allowance  and payment of special interest divided by the aggregate mean
      amount for the calendar year nineteen hundred sixty-six which  would  be

      the loan shall be insured.

      thereof,  twenty-five per centum of the present value of the outstanding
      loan shall be insured.
        3. From the sixtieth through the eighty-ninth  day  after  the  making
      thereof,  fifty  per centum of the present value of the outstanding loan
      shall be insured.
        4. On and after the ninetieth day after the making thereof, all of the
      present value of the outstanding loan shall be insured.
        Upon the death of a member, the amount of insurance so  payable  shall
      be credited to his or her accumulated contributions.

      retirement  and  social  security  law, it shall be presumptive evidence
      that it was incurred in the performance and discharge of  duty  and  the
      natural  and proximate result of an accident not caused by such member's
      own willful negligence, unless  the  contrary  be  proved  by  competent
      evidence.
        (b)  The  New York City Police Pension Fund (NYCPPF) board of trustees
      is hereby authorized to promulgate rules and  regulations  to  implement
      the provisions of this paragraph.
        2.  (a)  Notwithstanding  the  provisions  of  this  chapter or of any
      general, special or local law, charter, administrative code or  rule  or
      regulation  to the contrary, if a member who participated in World Trade
      Center rescue, recovery or cleanup operations as defined in section  two
      of the retirement and social security law, and subsequently retired on a
      service  retirement,  an  ordinary  disability retirement, an accidental
      disability retirement, a performance of duty disability  retirement,  or
      was separated from service with a vested right to deferred payability of
      a  retirement  allowance and subsequent to such retirement or separation
      is determined by the NYCPPF board of trustees to have a qualifying World
      Trade Center condition, as defined in section two of the retirement  and
      social  security  law,  upon  such  determination by the NYCPPF board of
      trustees, it shall be presumed that such disability was incurred in  the
      performance and discharge of duty as the natural and proximate result of
      an accident not caused by such member's own willful negligence, and that
      the  member would have been physically or mentally incapacitated for the
      performance and discharge of duty of the position from which he  or  she
      retired  or  vested  had the condition been known and fully developed at
      the time of the member's retirement  or  separation  from  service  with
      vested rights, unless the contrary is proven by competent evidence.
        (b)  The NYCPPF board of trustees shall consider a reclassification of
      the  member's  retirement  or  vesting  as  an   accidental   disability
      retirement effective as of the date of such reclassification.
        (c)  Such  member's retirement option shall not be changed as a result
      of such reclassification.
        (d)  The  member's  former  employer  at  the  time  of  the  member's
      retirement  shall  have  an  opportunity  to  be  heard  on the member's
      application  for  reclassification  by  the  NYCPPF  board  of  trustees
      according to procedures developed by the NYCPPF board of trustees.
        (e)  The  NYCPPF  board of trustees is hereby authorized to promulgate
      rules and regulations to implement the provisions of this paragraph.
        3. Notwithstanding any other provision  of  this  chapter  or  of  any
      general,  special  or local law, charter, administrative code or rule or
      regulation to the contrary, if a retiree or vestee who: (1) has met  the
      criteria  of subdivision one of this section and retired on a service or
      disability retirement, would  have  met  the  criteria  if  not  already
      retired  on an accidental disability, or was separated from service with
      a vested right to deferred payability of a retirement allowance; and (2)
      has not been retired for more than twenty-five years; and (3) dies  from
      a  qualifying World Trade Center condition, as defined in section two of
      the retirement and social security law, as determined by the  applicable
      head  of  the retirement system or applicable medical board, then unless
      the contrary be proven by competent evidence,  such  retiree  or  vestee
      shall  be  deemed  to  have died as a natural and proximate result of an
      accident sustained in the performance of duty and not  as  a  result  of
    
      willful  negligence  on  his  or  her  part.  Such retiree's or vestee's
      eligible beneficiary, as set forth in section 13-244 of this subchapter,
      shall be entitled to an accidental death benefit as provided by  section
      13-244  of this subchapter, however, for the purposes of determining the
      salary base upon which the accidental death benefit is  calculated,  the
      retiree or vestee shall be deemed to have died on the date of his or her
      retirement  or  separation  from  service  with  vested rights. Upon the
      retiree's or vestee's death,  the  eligible  beneficiary  shall  make  a
      written application to the head of the retirement system within the time
      for  filing  an application for an accidental death benefit as set forth
      in section 13-244 of  this  subchapter  requesting  conversion  of  such
      retiree's  service,  vested right or disability retirement benefit to an
      accidental death benefit. At the time of such conversion,  the  eligible
      beneficiary  shall  relinquish  all  rights  to the prospective benefits
      payable under the service or disability retirement  benefit,  or  vested
      right  to  such  benefit,  including any post-retirement death benefits,
      since the retiree's or vestee's death. If the  eligible  beneficiary  is
      not  the  only  beneficiary  receiving  or entitled to receive a benefit
      under the service or disability retirement benefit (including,  but  not
      limited  to,  post-retirement death benefits or benefits paid or payable
      pursuant to the retiree's option selection), or that  will  be  eligible
      under  the  vested  right,  the accidental death benefit payments to the
      eligible beneficiary will be reduced by any amounts paid or  payable  to
      any other beneficiary.
        4. Notwithstanding any other provision of this code or of any general,
      special or local law, charter, or rule or regulation to the contrary, if
      a  member  who:  (1)  has  met  the  criteria of subdivision one of this
      section; (2) dies in active service or  after  separating  from  service
      with  a  vested  right to deferred payability of a retirement allowance,
      but prior to the payability of that retirement allowance; and  (3)  dies
      from  a  qualifying  World Trade Center condition, as defined in section
      two of the retirement and social security  law,  as  determined  by  the
      applicable  head of the retirement system or applicable medical board to
      have been caused by such  member's  participation  in  the  World  Trade
      Center rescue, recovery or cleanup operations, as defined in section two
      of  the  retirement and social security law, then unless the contrary be
      proven by competent evidence, such member shall be deemed to  have  died
      as  a  natural  and  proximate  result  of  an accident sustained in the
      performance of duty and not as a result of willful negligence on his  or
      her  part.  Such  member's eligible beneficiary, as set forth in section
      13-244 of this subchapter, shall be  entitled  to  an  accidental  death
      benefit  provided he or she makes written application to the head of the
      retirement system within the time  for  filing  an  application  for  an
      accidental  death  benefit  as  set  forth  in  section  13-244  of this
      subchapter.

      board shall pay a dependent benefit to the surviving  spouse,  child  or
      children  or  dependent  parent or parents of any deceased member if the
      death of such member occur during his or her service or after he or  she
      was retired from service. The amount of any such dependent benefit to be
      paid by the board to each of the several representatives of such member,
      in  case  there  shall  be  more  than  one,  from  time to time, may be
      determined by such board according to the circumstances  of  each  case.
      The annual dependent benefit to the representative or representatives of
      such  member, however, shall be six hundred dollars, and no part of such
      sum shall be paid to any such surviving spouse who shall remarry,  after
      such  remarriage, or to any child after it shall have reached the age of
      eighteen years.
        b. Dependent benefits shall be granted to the surviving spouse,  child
      or  children or dependent parent or parents of a member pursuant to this
      section only if such member, upon becoming  a  member,  shall  elect  to
      contribute  the  additional  deductions  provided  by  subdivision  d of
      section 13-227 of this subchapter.
        c. The benefits granted pursuant to this section shall be in  addition

        ยง  13-254  Safeguards  on disability retirement. a. Once each year the
      board may, and upon his or her application shall, require any disability
      pensioner, under the  minimum  age  or  period  for  service  retirement
      elected  by him or her, to undergo medical examination. Such examination
      shall be made at the place of residence of  such  beneficiary  or  other
      place  mutually agreed upon. Upon the completion of such examination the
      medical board shall  report  and  certify  to  the  board  whether  such
      beneficiary  is  or is not totally or partially incapacitated physically
      or mentally and whether he or she is or is not engaged  in  or  able  to
      engage  in a gainful occupation. If the board concurs in a report by the
      medical board that such beneficiary is  able  to  engage  in  a  gainful
      occupation,  he or she shall certify the name of such beneficiary to the
      appropriate civil service  commission,  state  or  municipal,  and  such
      commission  shall  place his or her name as a preferred eligible on such
      appropriate lists of candidates  as  are  prepared  for  appointment  to
      positions  for  which  he  or she is stated to be qualified. Should such
      beneficiary be engaged in a gainful occupation, or should he or  she  be
      offered  city-service as a result of the placing of his or her name on a
      civil service list, such board shall reduce the amount  of  his  or  her
      disability  pension  and his or her pension-for-increased-take-home-pay,
      if any, to an amount which, when added to that then  earned  by  him  or
      her,  or  earnable  by him or her in city-service so offered him or her,
      shall not exceed the current maximum salary for the  title  next  higher
      than  that  held  by  him  or her when he or she was retired. Should the
      earning capacity of such beneficiary be further altered, such board  may
      further    alter    his    or    her    pension    and    his   or   her
      pension-for-increased-take-home-pay, if any, to an  amount  which  shall
      not    exceed    the    rate    of    pension    and    his    or    her
      pension-for-increased-take-home-pay, if any, upon which he  or  she  was
      originally  retired  but which, subject to such limitation, shall equal,
      when added to that earnable by him or her, the  current  maximum  salary
      for  the  title  next higher than that held by him or her when he or she
      was retired. The provisions of  this  section  shall  be  executed,  any
      provision of the charter or the code to the contrary notwithstanding.
        b.  Should  any  disability pensioner, under the minimum age or period
      for service retirement elected by him or her, refuse to  submit  to  one
      medical  examination in any year by a physician or physicians designated
      by  the  medical  board,  his  or   her   pension   and   his   or   her
      pension-for-increased-take-home-pay,  if  any, may be discontinued until
      his or her withdrawal of such refusal. Should such refusal continue  for
      one  year,  all  his or her rights in and to such pension and his or her
      pension-for-increased-take-home-pay, if any,  may  be  revoked  by  such
      board.

      service, a member shall  receive  a  retirement  allowance  which  shall
      consist of:
        1.  An  annuity  based  on  his or her required annuity savings at the
      termination of his or her required minimum period  of  service,  and  in
      addition,  a  pension  which when added to the annuity shall be equal to
      one-half of his or her annual  earnable  compensation  on  the  date  of
      retirement,  for  his  or her minimum period of service. For the purpose
      only of determining the pension portion of the retirement allowance  for
      minimum  service, the member's annuity shall be computed as it would be,
      (a)  if  it  were  not  reduced  by  the  actuarial  equivalent  of  any
      outstanding  loan,  (b)  if  it  were  not  increased  by  the actuarial
      equivalent of any additional contributions, (c) if it were  not  reduced
      by  reason  of  the  member's  election  to  decrease his or her annuity
      contributions in order to apply the amount of such reduction in  payment
      of  his  or  her  contributions  for  old-age  and  survivors  insurance
      coverage, (d) as it would be without any optional modification;

        (a)  a  pension  of one-sixtieth of his or her average annual earnings
      from his or her date of eligibility for retirement to the actual date of
      retirement; and
        (b) a pension-providing-for-increased-take-home-pay which shall be the
      actuarial equivalent of the reserve-for-increased-take-home-pay to which
      he or she may be entitled, if any, for all periods of  such  service  in
      the police force rendered both (1) after the completion of such required
      minimum   service   in   such   police  force  and  (2)  after  December
      thirty-first, nineteen hundred sixty-six.
        3. For each year, or fraction thereof, of service  credit  transferred
      from  the  New  York  city  employees'  retirement  system, a pension of
      fifty-five per cent of one-sixtieth of his or her final compensation  if
      such  service  credit  was  for service rendered prior to October first,
      nineteen hundred fifty-one, or seventy-five per cent of one-sixtieth  of

      hundred sixty-nine, other than by death, retirement or dismissal; and
        (2) prior to such discontinuance, completed  five  or  more  years  of
      allowable police service; and

      provided in this section.
        b. (1) Upon such discontinuance under the conditions and in compliance
      with the provisions of subdivision a  of  this  section,  such  deferred

      discontinuance had not occurred.
        c. Such deferred retirement allowance shall consist of:
        (1) an annuity which is the actuarial equivalent of an amount equal to
      the member's accumulated deductions for the period of his or her  police
      service,  plus  any  accumulated contributions transferred to his or her
      credit pursuant to section forty-three  of  the  retirement  and  social
      security   law,   as  the  total  of  such  accumulated  deductions  and

      discontinuance  of  police  service, multiplied by a number equal to the
      number of years of allowable police service credited to him  or  her  on
      the  date of such discontinuance, plus the number of his or her years of
      service for which credit was transferred pursuant to section forty-three
      of the retirement and social security law; or
        (ii) in the case of any discontinued member whose minimum  period  for
      service  retirement  is  twenty-five  years,  two per cent of his or her
      annual earnable compensation on the date of his or her discontinuance of
      police service, multiplied by a number equal to the number of  years  of
      allowable  police  service  credited to him or her on the date of his or
      her discontinuance of police service, plus the number of years of his or
      her service  for  which  credit  was  transferred  pursuant  to  section

      transferred from the New  York  city  employees'  retirement  system,  a
      pension  of  fifty-five  per  cent  of  one-sixtieth of his or her final
      compensation if such service credit was for service  rendered  prior  to
      October  first,  nineteen hundred fifty-one, or seventy-five per cent of
      one-sixtieth of his or  her  final  compensation  if  such  service  was

        d.  For  the  purpose  only of determining the pension portion of such
      retirement allowance pursuant to paragraphs one and two of subdivision c
      of this section, the annuity referred to in such paragraph one shall  be
      computed  as  it  would  be  (1) if it were not reduced by the actuarial
      equivalent of any outstanding loan, (2) if it were not increased by  the
      actuarial equivalent of any additional contributions, (3) if it were not
      reduced  by  reason  of  the  member's  election  to decrease his or her
    
      annuity contributions in order to apply the amount of such reduction  in
      payment  of his or her contributions for old-age and survivors insurance
      coverage and (4) as it would be without any optional modification.
        e.  Regular  interest  on the accumulated deductions of a discontinued
      member and on his or her  reserve-for-increased-take-home-pay  shall  be
      credited  after discontinuance of police service at the rate which would
      be applicable if he or she had not discontinued service.
        f. If a discontinued member dies before attaining the earliest age  at
      which he or she could have retired for service if discontinuance had not
      occurred,  his  or  her  accumulated deductions shall be paid (1) to the
      beneficiary designated by him or her pursuant to section 13-243 of  this

        i. If  a  discontinued  member  who  has  not  withdrawn  his  or  her
      accumulated  deductions  in whole or in part shall subsequently re-enter
      police service before the  earliest  date  on  which  such  discontinued
      member  could  have  retired  for  service  if  discontinuance  had  not

      to  which  he  or  she  was  entitled  immediately  prior  to his or her
      discontinuance of police service and  shall  be  credited  with  regular

      reserve-for-increased-take-home-pay from the time of such discontinuance
      to the time of his or her re-entry into service, at the rate which would
      have been applicable if he or she had not discontinued service.
        j. (1) If a discontinued member who  has  not  withdrawn  his  or  her
      accumulated  deductions in whole or in part shall subsequently and on or
      after the earliest date on which such  discontinued  member  could  have
      retired  for service if discontinuance had not occurred, re-enter police
      service, the payment of his or her pension only shall be  suspended  and
      forfeited  during  the  period  of such police service, except as herein
      otherwise provided.

      within ninety days after his or her return to service, he or she files a
      duly executed and acknowledged application for such membership.
        (3)  If  such  beneficiary  shall again become a member of the pension
      fund, the payment of his or her annuity  shall  also  be  suspended  and
      forfeited  and his or her annuity reserve shall be transferred to his or
      her credit in the annuity savings fund and he or she shall  become  such
      member  as  a  new  entrant;  provided,  however,  that  he or she shall
      contribute to such fund at the rate (before  modification,  if  any,  to
      which  such  discontinued  member  may  be  entitled pursuant to section
      13-226  of  this  subchapter)  at  which  he  or  she  would  have  been
      contributing  if he or she had not discontinued police service. Upon his
      or her subsequent retirement, he or she shall be credited  with  all  of
      his or her service as a member subsequent to his or her last restoration
      to  membership  and  he  or  she  shall  receive  therefor  a retirement
      allowance, payable in such form as he or she shall select under  section
      13-261 of this subchapter, consisting of:
        (i)  an  annuity  which  is  the  actuarial  equivalent  of his or her
      accumulated deductions at the time of such retirement; and
    
        (ii) a pension equal to one-sixtieth of  his  or  her  average  annual
      earnings  from  the  date  of his or her re-entry into membership to the
      date of his or her subsequent retirement, multiplied by  the  number  of
      years  of  his  or her allowable service in the police force rendered by
      him or her from such date of re-entry; and
        (iii)  a  pension-providing-for-increased-take-home-pay  which  is the
      actuarial equivalent of the reserve-for-increased-take-home-pay to which
      he or she may be entitled,  if  any,  for  the  period  of  his  or  her
      allowable  service  in the police force rendered by him or her from such
      date of re-entry.
        (4) In addition, upon his or her  subsequent  retirement,  he  or  she
      shall  receive  the pension which he or she was receiving or entitled to
      receive immediately prior to his or her last restoration.
        (5) In lieu of suspension during restoration to police service of  any
      benefits  payable  in  the  event  of  his or her death by reason of any
      optional  selection  in  respect  to  his  or  her  pension,  any   such
      beneficiary  may pay to the fund or funds from which his or her ordinary

      omitted  payments,  together  with the regular interest which they would

      the percentage thereof which is the difference between such  lesser  per
      cent and one hundred per cent.

      the medical board or on the board in the determination of eligibility of

      claim for  workers'  compensation  benefits,  the  board  may  authorize
      payment  of all or any part of the benefits which are payable under this
      subchapter and to which any of the foregoing provisions of this  section
      apply,  and  in  that  event  the  pension  fund  shall  be  entitled to

      compensation due under the workers' compensation law provided that claim
      therefor  is  filed  with the workers' compensation board, together with

      as otherwise provided in paragraph three of this subdivision a, if he or

      has attained the minimum service retirement age elected by him or her he
      or she may file a duly executed and  acknowledged  application  therefor
      within  ninety  days  after  his  or her return to service and thereupon
      again become a member of such fund.
        (3) In the case of  any  such  beneficiary  who  is  appointed  police

      contribute to such fund as if he or she were a new entrant.
        (5) Upon the subsequent retirement of any such member whose membership
      is so restored, he or she shall be credited with all his or her  service
      as a member subsequent to his or her last restoration to membership, and
      shall receive a retirement allowance therefor as if he or she were a new
      entrant,  payable  in  such form as he or she shall select under section
      13-261 of this subchapter.
        (6) In lieu of suspension during restoration to  city-service  of  any

      pay  to the fund or funds from which his or her ordinary pension and his
      or  her  pension-providing-for-increased-take-home-pay,  if  any,   were
      payable,  the  amount  by  which  his  or  her  ordinary pension and the
      pension-providing-for-increased-take-home-pay,  if  any,  exceeded   the
      optional  pension and the pension-providing-for-increased-take-home-pay,
      if any, heretofore granted to him or her, in which event  such  optional
      benefit  shall  continue and be payable in the event of his or her death
      as though no payment were suspended.
        (7) In addition, upon his or her  subsequent  retirement,  he  or  she
      shall         receive         the         pension         and        the
      pension-providing-for-increased-take-home-pay, if any, which he  or  she
      was  receiving  or  entitled  to receive immediately prior to his or her
      last restoration.
        b. (1) Subject to the provisions of paragraph two of this subdivision,
      where any beneficiary mentioned in subdivision a of this section,  other
      than  a  beneficiary  serving  as  police  commissioner or deputy police
      commissioner, shall have earned at least five years of member credit for
      service in the police force after restoration  to  active  service,  and
      where  any  beneficiary  serving as police commissioner or deputy police
      commissioner shall have earned at least three years of member credit for
      service during restoration to membership pursuant to this  section,  the
      total  service credit to which he or she was entitled at the time of his
      or her earlier retirement may, at his or her election, again be credited
      to him or her and upon his or her subsequent retirement he or she  shall
    
      be  credited  in  addition  with all member service earned by him or her
      subsequent to his or her last restoration to membership.
        (2)  Such  total service credit to which he or she was entitled at the
      time of his or her earlier retirement shall be credited as  provided  in
      paragraph  one  of  this  subdivision b only in the event that he or she
      returns  to  the  pension  fund  with  regular  interest  the  actuarial
      equivalent of the amount of the retirement allowance he or she received;
      provided,  however, that in the event that such amount is not so repaid,
      the actuarial equivalent thereof shall  be  deducted  from  his  or  her
      subsequent retirement allowance.

Section 13-267.1 ::    
        
     
        ยง  13-267.1  Excess  benefit  plan.  a.  As  used in this section, the
      following words and phrases shall have the following meanings, unless  a
      different meaning is plainly required by the context:
        (1) "Retirement benefits" shall mean benefits payable to a beneficiary
      by  the pension fund or a variable supplements fund established pursuant
      to subchapter three or four of this chapter which  are  subject  to  the
      limitations imposed by section 415(b) of the Internal Revenue Code.
        (2)  "Beneficiary"  shall  mean  a  person who is receiving retirement
      benefits from the pension fund.
        (3)  "Excess  benefit  plan"  shall  mean  the  excess  benefit   plan
      established  by  this section for the sole purpose of paying benefits as
      permitted under section 415(m) of the Internal Revenue Code.
        (4) "Eligible participant" shall mean a beneficiary who is entitled to
      replacement benefits from the excess benefit plan for  a  plan  year  in
      accordance with subdivisions d and e of this section.
        (5)  "Replacement  benefits"  shall  mean  the benefits payable by the
      excess benefit plan to an eligible participant as determined pursuant to
      subdivision e of this section.
        (6) "Internal Revenue Code" shall mean the  Federal  Internal  Revenue
      Code of 1986, as amended.
        (7)  "Plan year" shall mean the limitation year of the pension fund as
      provided in section six hundred twenty  of  the  retirement  and  social
      security law.
        b.  There  is  hereby  established  an  excess  benefit plan, the sole
      purpose of which shall be to provide replacement benefits, as  permitted
      by  section  415(m) of the Internal Revenue Code, to beneficiaries whose
      annual retirement benefits  have  been  reduced  because  such  benefits
      exceed the limitations imposed by section 415(b) of the Internal Revenue
      Code.  The  excess  benefit  plan  shall be administered by the board of
      trustees of the pension fund.
        c. There is hereby established a  fund  to  be  known  as  the  excess
      benefit fund which shall be maintained for the sole purpose of providing
      replacement benefits to eligible participants in the excess benefit plan
      established  by  this  section, as permitted under section 415(m) of the
      Internal  Revenue  Code.  Such  fund  shall  consist  of  such  employer
      contributions as shall be made thereto pursuant to subdivision f of this
      section.  Such  contributions  to  the excess benefit fund shall be held
      separate and apart from the assets  held  by  the  other  funds  of  the
      pension  fund,  provided, however, that the assets of the excess benefit
      fund may be invested with the other pension fund assets, but such excess
      benefit fund assets shall be accounted for  separately  from  the  other
      pension fund assets.
        d. All beneficiaries of the pension fund whose retirement benefits for
      a  plan year are being reduced because of section 415(b) of the Internal
      Revenue Code shall be eligible participants in the excess  benefit  plan
      for  that  plan  year. Participation in the excess benefit plan shall be
      determined for each plan year. No beneficiary of the pension fund  shall
      be  an eligible participant in the excess benefit plan for any plan year
      for which his or her retirement benefits  are  not  reduced  because  of
      section 415(b) of the Internal Revenue Code.
        e.  (1)  For  each  plan  year  in  which a beneficiary is an eligible
      participant in the excess benefit plan, such eligible participant  shall
      receive  replacement  benefits from the excess benefit plan equal to the
      difference between the full amount of the retirement benefits  otherwise
      payable  to  the  eligible  participant  for that plan year prior to any
      reduction because of section 415(b) of the Internal  Revenue  Code,  and
      the  retirement  benefits  payable  to the eligible participant for that
      plan year as reduced because of section 415(b) of the  Internal  Revenue
    
      Code.  No  replacement benefits for any plan year shall be paid pursuant
      to this subdivision to any beneficiary who is not  receiving  retirement
      benefits from the pension fund for that plan year.
        (2) Replacement benefits pursuant to this section shall be paid at the
      same  time  and  in the same manner as the retirement benefits which are
      being replaced. At no time shall an eligible  participant  be  permitted
      directly  or  indirectly  to defer compensation under the excess benefit
      plan.
        f. (1) The required employer contributions to the excess benefit  fund
      for  each  plan  year  shall be an amount, as determined by the actuary,
      which is necessary to pay the total amount of replacement benefits  that
      are  payable  pursuant to this section to eligible participants for that
      plan year.
        (2) Such required employer contributions shall be paid into the excess
      benefit fund from an allocation of  the  employer  contribution  amounts
      paid  pursuant to section 13-228 of this subchapter and other applicable
      provisions of law. Such  allocation  of  employer  contribution  amounts
      shall  be  paid  into  the excess benefit fund at such times and in such
      amounts as determined by the actuary.
        (3) The benefit liabilities of the excess benefit plan shall be funded
      on a plan year to plan year basis, provided, however, that any  employer
      contributions  to  the  excess  benefit  fund,  including any investment
      earnings on such contributions, which are not used  to  pay  replacement
      benefits  for  the  current  plan  year shall be used to pay replacement
      benefits for future plan years.
        g. The  right  of  an  eligible  participant  to  receive  replacement
      benefits pursuant to this section, and the replacement benefits received
      pursuant  to  this  section, shall be exempt from any state or municipal
      tax, and shall not be subject to execution, garnishment,  attachment  or
      any  other  process  whatsoever,  and  shall  be unassignable, except as
      otherwise specifically provided for  benefits  payable  by  the  pension
      fund.
        h.  Nothing  contained  in  this section shall be construed to mean or
      imply that variable supplements payments  from  a  variable  supplements
      fund  established  pursuant  to subchapter three or four of this chapter
      constitute pension or retirement allowance payments, or  that  any  such
      variable  supplements fund constitutes a pension or retirement system or
      fund.
        i. Nothing contained in this section shall be construed  as  affecting
      in  any  way  the  eligibility  of  any  person for variable supplements
      pursuant to applicable provisions of subchapter three or  four  of  this
      chapter.
