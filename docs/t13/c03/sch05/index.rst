      applicable provisions of such subparagraph (ii) or subparagraph (iii).

        (2) The legislature hereby  declares  that  the  variable  supplements
      authorized by this subchapter and the granting and receipt thereof:
        (i)  shall  not  create  or  constitute  membership  in  a  pension or

      pension fund beneficiary or with any member of pension  fund  subchapter
      one or pension fund subchapter two; and

      firefighter on or after July first,  nineteen  hundred  sixty-nine,  but
      prior  to  July nineteenth, nineteen hundred eighty-nine shall be deemed
      to be a pension fund beneficiary for purposes of eligibility to  receive
      supplemental  benefits  under  this  section  for any period of time for
    
      which  such  discontinued  member  receives  payments  of   a   deferred
      retirement  allowance  pursuant  to  section  13-360  or  13-361 of this
      chapter, and the date of retirement of  such  discontinued  member,  for
      purposes  of  applying  the requirements of this section which determine
      the eligibility of a pension fund beneficiary  to  receive  supplemental
      benefits  under this section, shall be deemed to be the first day of the
      period for which such discontinued member first began receiving payments
      of a deferred retirement allowance pursuant to section 13-360 or  13-361
      of this chapter.
        f.  For  the purposes of paragraphs eleven and twelve of subdivision a

      beneficiary has transferred service credit from such police pension fund
      pursuant to the provisions of section 15-111 of this code.
        g. In addition to the payments set  forth  in  paragraphs  eleven  and
      twelve  of  subdivision  a  of this section, there shall be paid to each
      pension fund beneficiary,  on  or  about  the  December  fifteenth  next

      variable  supplements   payments,   subject   to   the   provisions   of
      subparagraphs  (i)  and  (ii)  of paragraph one of subdivision b of this
      section, that he or she would have received, had he or  she  retired  on
      the  date  of his or her earliest eligibility for service retirement, in
      the period measured from (1) the later of (i) such earliest  eligibility
      date and (ii) January 1, 2002, and (2) his or her date of retirement.
        h. Notwithstanding any other provision of law to the contrary, where a
      pension  fund  beneficiary has transferred credit from the New York city
      employees' retirement  system  to  the  fire  department  pension  fund,
      subchapter  two  for  service rendered in the uniformed force of the New
      York city department of correction which immediately preceded service in
      the  uniformed  force  of  the  fire  department,  such   pension   fund
      beneficiary  shall,  for the purposes of paragraphs eleven and twelve of
      subdivision  a  of  this  section,  have  the  earliest  date  of   such
      transferred uniformed correction service substituted for his or her date
      of entry into the fire department pension fund, subchapter two.
