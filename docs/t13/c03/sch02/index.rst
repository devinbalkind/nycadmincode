      method shall not be entitled to make any change  in  such  selection  of
      mode of benefit.
        (B)   (1)   Notwithstanding   the  provisions  of  item  (A)  of  this
      subparagraph (v), a person  entitled  to  a  recomputation  of  benefits

        (2) In any case where the original selection of mode of benefit  of  a

      no change from such original selection of a joint  and  survivor  option
      may  be  made  under  this  item  (B)  to any other selection of mode of
      benefit if the designated beneficiary  selected  with  respect  to  such
      joint  and survivor option by such person entitled to a recomputation is
      not alive at the time of filing of the form whereby such person entitled
      to a recomputation seeks to change, pursuant to this item  (B),  his  or

      mode of benefit by executing, acknowledging and filing with the  pension
      fund, within the applicable period of time prescribed by sub-item six of
      this item, a new selection of mode of benefit. If the original selection
      of  mode  of  benefit  of  the  person  filing  such new selection was a
      selection of a joint and survivor option, such new  selection  shall  be
      void  and  of  no  effect unless (a) the designated beneficiary named in
      such original selection  of  a  joint  and  survivor  option  signs  and
      acknowledges,  in  the form for such new selection of mode of benefit, a
      consent to such changed selection of  mode  of  benefit,  and  (b)  such
      original  designated  beneficiary is alive on the date of filing of such

      method a letter showing amounts of  benefits,  as  recomputed  for  such
      person  under the better-of-two-computations method for modes of benefit
      other than  joint  and  survivor  options,  together  with  a  statement
      advising  such  person  that  upon  request,  the  amounts of recomputed
      benefits under joint and survivor options will be provided.
        (6) The period of time within which any  such  person  entitled  to  a
      recomputation  may  file  a new selection of mode of benefit as provided
      for in sub-items three and four of this item (B)  shall  be  sixty  days
      after  the  date  of  issuance  set  forth in such letter mailed to such
      person pursuant to sub-item five of this item; provided,  however,  that
      if, pursuant to the request of such person, a later letter setting forth
      benefits  information  in relation to new selection of a mode of benefit
      is mailed to such person by the pension fund, such period  of  time  for
      filing a new selection of mode of benefit shall be thirty days after the
      date of issuance set forth in such later letter.
        (7)  Upon the filing of a new selection of mode of benefit pursuant to
      this item (B) by any such person entitled to a recomputation,  such  new
      selection  shall be irrevocable and such person shall not be entitled to
      file any other selection  of  mode  of  benefit  with  respect  to  such
      retirement  allowance (or any component thereof) which became payable to
      him or her prior to the date of enactment of paragraph (j).
        (8) No new  selection  of  mode  of  benefit  filed  pursuant  to  the
      preceding  sub-items  of  this item (B) shall be valid or effective as a
      change of mode of benefit or for any other  purpose  unless  the  person
      entitled    to   a   recomputation   of   benefits   pursuant   to   the
      better-of-two-computations method who files such new selection is  alive
      on  the  date  (hereinafter  referred to as the "validating date") three
      hundred sixty-five days after the date of filing of such  new  selection
      of  mode of benefit. If such person filing such new selection of mode of
      benefit is alive on  the  validating  date  with  respect  to  such  new
      selection,  such  new selection shall become valid and effective on such
      validating date; provided, however, that from and  after  the  effective
      date  of  retirement  of such person making such valid and effective new
      selection of mode of benefit (if  he  or  she  retired  for  service  or
      superannuation or for ordinary or accident disability) or from and after
      the  date  on  which  payability of the original benefits of such person
      began (if he or she was a discontinued member), such  new  selection  of
      mode  of  benefit  shall  supersede  such  original selection of mode of
      benefit and shall apply to and govern the amount of benefits payable  to
      such person or to his or her designated beneficiary or estate.

      selection  of mode of benefit (as defined in subdivision thirty-three of
      this section 13-313) made by him or her  with  respect  to  any  benefit
      which,  upon  his  or  her  subsequent  retirement  or discontinuance of
      service so as to qualify for benefits, is payable to him  or  her  as  a
      continuation,  without  change, of a benefit which had previously become
      payable to him or her by reason of his or her prior retirement.
        (vii) Subject  to  the  provisions  of  subparagraph  (viii)  of  this
      paragraph  (j),  in  any case where a discontinued member referred to in
      item (A) of subparagraph (iv) of this paragraph (j) returned or  returns
      to  city-service  and,  on  or after July thirty-first, nineteen hundred
      eighty-three, again became or  becomes  an  active  member  pursuant  to
      applicable  provisions of law, nothing contained in subparagraphs (i) to

      or  her  with  respect  to any benefit which, upon his or her subsequent
      retirement or discontinuance of service so as to qualify  for  benefits,
      is payable to him or her as a continuation, without change, of a benefit
      which  had  previously  become payable to him or her by reason of his or
      her prior discontinuance of service.
        (viii) Nothing contained in subparagraphs (v), (vi) and (vii) of  this
      paragraph (j) shall be construed as preventing:
        (A)  any person subject to such subparagraph (v) who, on or after July
      thirty-first, nineteen hundred  eighty-three,  re-entered  or  re-enters
      city-service and again became or becomes an active member; or
        (B)  any  re-entered  member  referred to in such subparagraph (vi) or
      subparagraph (vii);

      forty-one of the legislative law) of this paragraph  (j)  shall  be  the
      rate  of  regular interest which was applicable, under the provisions of
      law in effect prior to such date of enactment, to the  determination  of

      the  preceding subparagraphs of this paragraph (j) shall be construed as
      applicable to the determination of the rate of  member  contribution  of
      any  such  member  whose  last  membership  so  began  or as changing or

      of required member contributions),  would  be  required  by  law  to  be

      with  or  next occurs after the date or commencement of the status of an
      elective improved benefits plan member as such a member,  as  prescribed
      by the applicable provisions of this subchapter, there shall be deducted
      from  the  compensation of each such member on each and every payroll of
      such member for each and every payroll period a proportion of his or her
      earnable compensation equal to the  proportion  which  would  have  been
      determined by the actuary, as of his or her date of inception of pension
      fund  membership  (as defined in subdivision twenty of section 13-313 of
      this subchapter), as his or her  rate  of  member  contribution  (before
      reduction  on  account  of  increased-take-home-pay)  as a member of the
      police pension fund maintained pursuant to subchapter two of chapter two
      of this title, if,  as  of  such  date  of  inception  of  pension  fund
      membership,  he  or she had not become a member of this pension fund and
      had instead become a member  of  such  police  pension  fund;  provided,
      however,  that  if  the foregoing provisions of this subdivision i would
      otherwise require that such proportion be  determined  pursuant  to  the
      provisions  of subdivision a of section 13-225 of this title, as enacted
      by local law number two of the city for  nineteen  hundred  forty,  such
      proportion  shall be determined by the actuary in the same manner as if,
      as of such date of inception of pension fund membership, the  provisions
      of such subdivision a, as amended by local law number eighty-nine of the
      city  for  nineteen  hundred  fifty-one, and been in effect, so that the
      fraction  to  be  used  in  such  computation   shall   be   twenty-five
      seventy-fifths.  Such  proportion  of  compensation  determined  for any
      elective improved benefits plan member pursuant  to  the  provisions  of
      this  subdivision i shall be computed to remain constant. The provisions
      of section 13-327 of this subchapter shall apply to such deductions  and

      membership in the pension fund as a non-elective improved benefits  plan
      member; and
        (ii)  with  respect  to  which  period  he or she was required to make

      contributions  determined pursuant to section 13-325 of this subchapter,
      as in  effect  before  or  on  or  after  the  effective  date  of  this
      subdivision;
      shall be subject to a contribution rate deficiency, unless and until the
      amount thereof has been paid in full to the pension fund.
        (3)  Any  improved  benefits  plan  discontinued member (as defined in
      subdivision sixteen-d of such section 13-313) who, immediately prior  to

      a member, was subject  to  a  contribution  rate  deficiency,  shall  be

      discontinued member, unless and until the amount thereof has  been  paid
      in full to the pension fund.
    
        (4) In any case where an original plan discontinued member (as defined
      in  subdivision  sixteen  of  such  section  13-313) becomes an improved
      benefits  plan  discontinued  member  pursuant  to  the  provisions   of
      paragraph  six of subdivision i of section 13-360 of this subchapter, he
      or  she  shall  be  subject to a contribution rate deficiency unless and
      until the amount thereof has been paid in full to the pension fund.
        (5) For the purpose of payment of a contribution  rate  deficiency  or
      any part thereof to the pension fund by an improved benefits plan member
      who  is subject to such a deficiency, such deficiency shall be deemed to
      consist of:
        (i) the amount thereof, without  regular  interest  thereon,  if  such
      member completed his or her minimum period for service retirement before
      becoming an improved benefits plan member; or
        (ii)  the  amount thereof, plus regular interest and special interest,
      if any, thereon, from his or her date of commencement  of  contributions

      of such section) 13-313 to (A) the date of  completion  of  his  or  her
      minimum  period  for  service retirement, or (B) the date of payment, if
      such member becomes an improved benefits plan member  before  completion
      of his or her minimum period for service retirement.
        (6)  For  the  purpose of payment of a contribution rate deficiency or
      any parts thereof to the pension  fund  by  an  improved  benefits  plan
      discontinued  member  who is subject to such deficiency, such deficiency
      shall be deemed to consist of the amount thereof, plus regular  interest
      and  special  interest, if any, thereon from the date of commencement of
      contributions as an improved benefits plan member, as applicable to such
      member, to and including the date next preceding the date of payment.
        (7) No contribution rate deficiency which  includes  regular  interest
      and special interest, if any, thereon as provided for by paragraphs five
      and  six  of  this  subdivision j shall be deemed paid unless the amount
      thereof, together with such regular interest and  special  interest,  if
      any, is paid in full to the pension fund.
        (8)  Subject  to  the  provisions of paragraphs five, six and seven of
      this subdivision, each improved benefits plan member who is subject to a
      contribution rate deficiency may, at any time  while  he  or  she  is  a
      member,  at  his  or  her election pay to the pension fund the amount of
      such deficiency or so much thereof as remains unpaid.
        (9) Subject to the provisions of paragraph five of  this  subdivision,
      at  any  time before the date of required commencement of payment of any
      benefit payable to an improved benefits plan discontinued member who  is
      subject  to  a contribution rate deficiency, he or she may at his or her
      election pay to the pension fund the amount of  such  deficiency  or  so
      much thereof as remains unpaid.
        (10) The board shall adopt rules and regulations governing the payment
      of  a  contribution  rate  deficiency or the unpaid portion thereof in a
      lump sum, in periodic installments or in such other manner as the  board
      shall  prescribe;  provided,  however,  that  such rules and regulations

      her contribution rate deficiency remaining unpaid.
        l. (1) Upon the filing of an application by an original plan member to
      become an elective improved benefits plan member, an amount equal to his
      or her accumulated contributions (as defined  in  subdivision  seven  of
      section 13-313 of this subchapter), as such contributions were as of the
      date  next preceding the date of commencement of his or her status as an
    
      elective improved benefits plan member, shall be  transferred  from  the
      contingent  reserve  fund  to the credit of such member's account in the

      credited, immediately prior to becoming such a member, with  accumulated
      contributions,  such  contributions,  upon  his  or  her becoming such a
      member, shall be transferred from the contingent  reserve  fund  to  the
      credit of such member's account in the annuity savings fund.

      accumulated contributions (as defined in subdivision  six-c  of  section
      13-313  of  this subchapter) of such retiree (as such amount would be in
      the absence of a loan), and (b) is the amount (a) would be  if  (i)  the
      contribution  rate  of  such  retiree  on and after July first, nineteen
      hundred eighty-one had been the rate which would be his  or  her  normal
      rate  of contribution as an improved benefits plan member (as defined in
      subdivision eighteen of such section 13-313 of this subchapter) and (ii)
      regular and special interest had been credited  on  and  added  to  such
      retiree's hypothetical member contributions on and after such July first

      is  the  amount  of  the  subsequent  original  plan  member accumulated
      contributions (as defined in subdivision six-c of such  section  13-313)
      of  such  person  (as such amount would be in the absence of a loan) and
      (b) is the amount (a) would be if (i)  the  contribution  rate  of  such
      person on and after July first, nineteen hundred eighty-one had been the
      rate  which  would  be  his  or  her  normal  rate of contribution as an
      improved benefits plan member (as defined  in  subdivision  eighteen  of
      such  section  13-313)  and  (ii)  regular and special interest had been
      credited on and added to such person's hypothetical member contributions
      on and after such July first resulting from such normal rate.
        (3) Notwithstanding any other provision of law to the contrary, in any
      case where, during the period beginning on July second, nineteen hundred
      eighty-one and ending on the date thirty days after the  effective  date
      of this subdivision m, any member was or shall be retired for service or
      superannuation  or  for ordinary or accident disability, and at the time
      of such retirement, such member was or shall be an original plan member,
      such retiree may, by a written application duly executed and filed  with
      the  board  on or after the effective date of this subdivision and prior
      to January first, nineteen hundred eighty-three,  elect  the  applicable
      benefits  of  this  subdivision. Any retiree who makes such election (a)
      shall be deemed  to  have  become  an  improved  benefits  plan  member,
      effective  July  first, nineteen hundred eighty-one, (b) shall be deemed
      to have been retired, on the effective date of his or her retirement, as

      other retirement allowance to which he or she would have  been  entitled
      if  he  or  she  had  not  made  such  election,  a retirement allowance
      determined  (subject  to  the  provisions  of  paragraph  four  of  this
    
      subdivision  m)  for  him  or  her  in the same manner as if, where such
      retirement occurred during the period beginning on July second, nineteen
      hundred  eighty-one  and  ending  on  January  first,  nineteen  hundred
      eighty-two,  such retiree, on the date next preceding the effective date
      of his or her retirement, had elected to be an  improved  benefits  plan
      member,  or  as  if, where such retirement occurred or occurs during the
      period beginning on January  second,  nineteen  hundred  eighty-two  and
      ending  on  the  date  thirty  days  after  the  effective  date of this
      subdivision m, the provisions of  this  subchapter  had  permitted  such
      retiree,  on  the  date  next preceding the effective date of his or her
      retirement, to elect to be an improved benefits plan  member,  effective
      July  first,  nineteen  hundred  eighty-one, and he or she had made such
      election on such next preceding date.
        (4) A retiree who makes such election pursuant to paragraph  three  of
      this  subdivision  m  shall be subject to a contribution rate deficiency
      (as  defined  in  subdivision  twenty-one  of  section  13-313  of  this
      subchapter)  unless  and until the amount thereof is paid to the pension
      fund in the manner provided for in paragraph five of  this  subdivision,
      and  in  any  case  where  any such retiree had not completed his or her
      minimum period for service retirement  prior  to  July  first,  nineteen
      hundred  eighty-one,  he  or  she shall also be subject to an additional
      contribution  rate  deficit  (as  defined  in  paragraph  one  of   this
      subdivision  m  ),  unless  and  until the amount thereof is paid to the
      pension fund in the manner provided for  in  such  paragraph  five.  The
      provisions of paragraphs five and seven of subdivision j of this section

      of this section shall not apply to payment of any such contribution rate
      deficiency.
        (5)  A retiree who makes such election may elect to pay to the pension

      whole or any part of the contribution rate deficiency to which he or she

      deficit  to  which he or she is subject. Any such payment, if elected by
      such retiree, shall be completed no later than the  date  of  filing  of
      such  retiree's  applicable  under paragraph three of this subdivision m
      electing the application benefits hereof.

      retirement  allowance  for the required minimum period of service of any
      retiree retired for service or superannuation who has filed an  election
      application pursuant to paragraph three of this subdivision m:
        (i)  in  any case where such retiree is subject to a contribution rate
      deficiency which remains  unpaid  in  whole  or  in  part,  the  annuity
      computed  for such retiree pursuant to paragraph one of subdivision a of

      applicable  benefits  of  this  subdivision  pursuant to paragraph three
      thereof had been paid to the pension fund on the  earlier  of  (A)  such
      member's  date  of commencement of contributions as an improved benefits

      this  subchapter) or (B) the date next following the date of termination
      of such member's required minimum period of service; and
        (ii) in any case where  such  retiree  is  subject  to  an  additional
      contribution rate deficit which remains unpaid in whole or in part, such
    
      annuity computed for such retiree shall be computed as it would be under
      assumptions  (i)  to  (iv),  inclusive,  of such subparagraph (a) and in
      addition, as such annuity would be if an amount equal to  the  whole  or
      any  part  of such additional contribution rate deficit remaining unpaid
      as of the date of the filing of such member's election of the applicable
      benefits of this subdivision pursuant to  paragraph  three  thereof  had
      been  paid  to  the  pension fund on the date next following the date of
      completion of such member's required minimum period of service.
        (7) For the purpose only of determining the  pension  portion  of  the
      retirement  allowance  payable  to  any  retiree  retired  for  ordinary
      disability who has filed an election application pursuant  to  paragraph
      three of this subdivision m:
        (i)  in  any case where such retiree is subject to a contribution rate
      deficiency which remains  unpaid  in  whole  or  in  part,  the  annuity
      computed  for such retiree pursuant to paragraph one of subdivision a of
      section 13-363 of this subchapter shall be computed as it would be under
      assumptions (i) to (iv), inclusive, of subdivision b  of  such  section,
      and  in  addition,  as  such  annuity would be if an amount equal to the
      whole or any part of such contribution rate deficiency remaining  unpaid
      as  of  the  date  of filing of such member's election of the applicable
      benefits of this subdivision pursuant to  paragraph  three  thereof  had

      commencement of contributions as an improved benefits  plan  member  (as
      defined in subdivision nineteen of section 13-313 of this subchapter) or
      (B)  the  date  next  following  the date of completion of such member's
      minimum period for service retirement; and
        (ii) in any case where  such  retiree  is  subject  to  an  additional
      contribution rate deficit which remains unpaid in whole or in part, such
      annuity computed for such retiree shall be computed as it would be under
      assumptions  (i)  to  (iv),  inclusive,  of  such  subdivision  b and in
      addition, as such annuity would be if an amount equal to  the  whole  or
      any  part  of such additional contribution rate deficit remaining unpaid

      case where, during the period beginning on July second, nineteen hundred
      eighty-one and ending on the date thirty days after the  effective  date
      of  this  subdivision  m, any original plan member discontinued or shall
      discontinue service so as to  acquire  a  vested  right  to  a  deferred

      executed and filed with the board on or after the effective date of this
      subdivision and prior to January first, nineteen  hundred  eighty-three,
      elect  the  applicable  benefits  of  this  subdivision. Any such person

      eighty-one, (b) shall be deemed to have discontinued service, as of  the
      date of such discontinuance of service as an original plan member, so as

      subdivision sixteen-d of such section 13-313) and (c) shall be  entitled
      to  receive, in lieu of any other deferred retirement allowance to which
      he or she would have been entitled if  he  or  she  had  not  made  such

      second,  nineteen  hundred  eighty-one  and  ending  on  January  first,
      nineteen hundred eighty-two, such person, on the date next preceding the

      second, nineteen hundred eighty-two and ending on the date  thirty  days
      after  the  effective  date  of this subdivision, the provisions of this

      member by reason of an election made pursuant to paragraph eight of this
      subdivision m may elect to pay  to  the  pension  fund,  in  the  manner

      provided,  however, that any such payment, if elected by any such person
      deemed to be an improved benefits plan  discontinued  member,  shall  be
      completed  no  later  than  the  later of (A) the date of filing of such
      person's application under paragraph eight of this subdivision  electing

      subchapter) of the deferred retirement allowance  payable  to  a  person

      annuity  computed  for  such  person  pursuant  to paragraph one of such
      subdivision c shall be computed as it would be under assumptions one  to

      addition,  as  it  would  be  in  an  amount  equal  to  the  additional
      contribution  rate  deficit  of such person had been paid to the pension
      fund on the day next preceding the date of such person's  discontinuance
      of  service  which qualified him or her as an original plan discontinued
      member.

      the retirement and social security law to  any  person  making  such  an
      election.
        (14)  The  privilege of making an election pursuant to paragraph three
      or paragraph eight of this subdivision m shall not apply to and may  not
      be  exercised  by  the estate, personal representatives, distributees or

      retirement  allowance or any choice or election prior to such expiration
      by or on his or her behalf  that  the  maximum  of  such  original  plan

      plan  retirement  allowance to which such retiree or discontinued member
      becomes entitled by reason of  the  filing  of  such  application  under

      be construed to form part of the period  within  which  membership  must
      begin.
        d.  (1)  Any  person  who was a member of the New York city employees'
      retirement system and whose membership therein was terminated by his  or

      New  York  city  employees'  retirement system for such prior creditable
      city service, prior to July first, nineteen hundred eighty-two.
        Subject to  the  provisions  of  paragraphs  two  and  three  of  this
      subdivision, no member of the said fire department pension fund shall be
      eligible  for  retirement  for service until he or she has served in the
      fire department for a minimum period of twenty or twenty-five years,  or
      until  he  or  she  has  reached the age of fifty-five, according to the
      minimum period or age of retirement elected by such member prior to  the
      certification of his or her rate of contribution.
        (2)  (a)  Subject  to  the  provisions  of  subparagraph  (b)  of this
      paragraph any period of allowable service rendered as an  "EMT  member,"
      as defined in paragraph one of subdivision a of section 13-157.2 of this
      title, as added by chapter five hundred seventy-seven of the laws of two
      thousand,  which  immediately precedes service in the uniformed force of
      the fire department, and any period of allowable service rendered (i) as
      a peace officer, as defined in section 2.10 of  the  criminal  procedure
      law,  (ii)  in the title of sheriff, deputy sheriff, marshal or district
      attorney investigator, or (iii) in any position specified in appendix  A
      of  the agreement dated October twenty-seventh, two thousand five, among
      the city of New York, the uniformed  firefighters  association  and  the
      uniformed  fire officers association, which immediately precedes service
      in the uniformed force  of  the  fire  department,  and  any  period  of
      allowable  service  in  the  uniformed  transit  police force, uniformed
      correction force, housing police service and the uniformed force of  the
      department  of sanitation immediately preceding service in the uniformed
      force of the fire department, credit  for  which  immediately  preceding
      allowable  service  was or is obtained pursuant to paragraph one of this
      subdivision, shall be deemed to be service in the uniformed force of the
      fire  department  for  purposes  of  eligibility  for  benefits  and  to
      determine the amount of benefits under the fire department pension fund.
        (b)  In  any  case  where  by  reason  of  credit for such immediately
      preceding service, the date  of  completion  of  such  member's  minimum
      period  for  service  retirement  under the fire department pension fund
      became or becomes earlier than such date would have been or would be  if
    
      such  credit  for  such  immediately  preceding  service had not been so
      acquired, there shall be effected with respect to such member:
        (i)  such  increase  in  such  member's  normal  rate of contribution,
      effective as of the date on which such member last became  a  member  of
      the  fire  department  pension fund, as may be necessary to reflect such
      earlier date of eligibility for service retirement; and
        (ii) the charging of such member who acquired or acquires such  credit
      for   such  immediately  preceding  service  with  a  contribution  rate
      deficiency:
        (A) which shall accrue from the date on which such member last  became
      a member of the fire department pension fund; and
        (B)  which  shall  be  in  such  amount as shall be the product of the
      increase provided in item (i) of this subparagraph (b) and the  member's
      compensation  during the period of time provided in sub-item (A) of this
      item (ii); and
        (C) which, unless paid by such member  in  such  manner  as  shall  be
      prescribed  by rules and regulations adopted by the board of trustees of
      such pension fund,  shall  require  an  appropriate  adjustment  of  any
      benefit which may become payable to or on account of such member.
        (3)  Nothing  contained  in  subparagraph (b) of paragraph two of this
      subdivision d shall cause a member  who  acquires  or  acquired  service
      credit by reason of the provisions of subparagraph (a) of such paragraph
      two to be denied:
        (a)  the  right  or  entitlement,  if  any,  to  terminate  or  reduce
      contributions to such pension fund or to  a  refund  of  or  credit  for
      contributions  paid  during  a  period  when  the member would have been
      entitled to terminate or reduce such contributions if he or she had such
      service credit on the date when he or she last became a  member  of  the
      pension fund; or
        (b)  any  other  right, benefit or entitlement of a similarly situated
      member of such pension fund with equal total service  credit  consisting
      only  of service in the uniformed force of the fire department, provided
      that the foregoing provisions of  this  paragraph  three  shall  not  be
      construed  in  a manner inconsistent with the provisions of subparagraph
      (b) of paragraph two of this subdivision d.
        e. Any improved benefits plan member who was a member of the board  of
      education  retirement system and whose membership therein was terminated
      by his or her attaining membership in this pension  fund  shall  receive
      credit  in such pension fund for prior creditable city-service by paying
      into the annuity savings fund of such pension fund  the  amount  of  the
      employee  contributions  required  to  have  been paid into the board of
      education retirement system  for  such  prior  creditable  city-service,
      within  one year after becoming a member of such pension fund, and shall
      have the period of such prior creditable city-service counted as service
      as a firefighter for the purpose only of determining the amount  of  his
      or  her  pension  or  retirement  allowance,  provided, however, that no
      member of such pension fund shall be eligible for retirement for service
      until he or she has served in the uniformed force of the department  for
      a  minimum  period  of  twenty  or  twenty-five  years, according to the
      minimum period elected by such member prior to the certification of  his
      or her rate of contribution.

      trainee shall receive credit in the said fire department  pension  fund,
      of  this  subchapter,  for prior creditable service in the New York city
      employees' retirement system earned while employed as a  New  York  city
      police department police trainee by paying into the annuity savings fund
      of  said  fire  department  pension fund additional member contributions
      plus interest which would have been paid or  credited  had  such  member
      been  a  member of the fire department pension fund, of this subchapter,
      from his or her last date of appointment  as  a  New  York  city  police
      department trainee or date of membership in the New York city employees'
      retirement  system,  whichever  is  later, provided such payment is made
      within one year after this subdivision shall take effect, and the period
      of such prior service credit shall be deemed to be service in  the  fire
      department for purposes of eligibility for benefits and to determine the
      amounts of benefits under the fire department pension fund.
        (2)  A member of the fire department pension fund, of this subchapter,
      who acquires service credit by reason of the provisions of paragraph one
      of this subdivision shall be entitled to any  other  right,  benefit  or
      entitlement  of  a  similarly  situated member of such pension fund with
      equal total service credit consisting only of service in  the  uniformed
      force of the fire department.
        h. Any member of the city of New York fire department pension fund who
      by  reason  of simultaneous membership in two public retirement systems,
      would have been entitled to transfer membership in a  public  retirement
      system  pursuant  to  any  provision of law, but failed to make a timely
      election to do so shall be  entitled  to  transfer  such  membership  if
      written  notice  is given to the first retirement system joined no later
      than one year subsequent to the effective date of  this  subdivision.  A
      member  who  provides  such  notice  may  file  a  written  request  for
      retroactive membership in the fire department pension fund within  three
      years of the effective date of this subdivision. The additional cost due
      to  the  retroactive  membership  shall be borne by the first retirement
      system.

        ยง 13-325 Contributions by original plan members. a. (1) The retirement
      allowance  accumulation  fund,  as established by the provisions of this
      subdivision as in effect prior to the  starting  date  of  the  improved
      benefits  plan  (as  such date is defined in subdivision twenty-seven of
      section 13-313 of  this  subchapter),  shall  cease  to  exist  on  such
      starting date.
        (2)   There  shall  be  transferred  from  such  retirement  allowance
      accumulation fund to the contingent reserve fund established by sections
      13-324 and 13-331 of  this  subchapter  all  assets  of  the  retirement
      allowance  accumulation  fund  as  of  such starting date, including the
      obligation represented by all unpaid amounts which are due  and  payable
      to  the  retirement allowance accumulation fund up to and including such
      date pursuant to the rates of member  deduction  and  city  contribution
      certified  under  section  13-321 of this subchapter prior to such date.
      Any such unpaid  amounts  which  constitute  assets  of  the  retirement
      allowance  accumulation  fund as of such starting date and which are due
      from and payable by the city shall be appropriated and paid by the  city
      pursuant  to  the  provisions of this section and section 13-334 of this
      subchapter as in effect immediately prior to such date.
        (3) Of  such  transferred  amount,  the  prior  original  plan  member
      accumulated  contributions  (as  defined in subdivision six-b of section
      13-313 of this subchapter), as of such starting date, of  each  original
      plan  member  shall be transferred to his or her credit in an individual
      account in the contingent reserve fund.
        b. (1) Subject to the provisions of paragraph two of subdivision c  of
      this section, on and after such starting date, each original plan member
      shall contribute to the pension fund, through deductions from his or her
      compensation  as  provided for by paragraph one of such subdivision c, a
      proportion of his or her earnable compensation (before reduction of such
      proportion on account of  any  program  for  increased-take-home-pay  in
      effect)  equal  to  the  proportion  of his or her earnable compensation
      (before reduction on account of any program for  increased-take-home-pay
      in  effect)  which  he  or she was required to contribute to the pension
      fund as of the date next preceding such starting date.
        (2) The normal rate of contribution as an  original  plan  member  (as
      defined  in  subdivision seventeen of section 13-313 of this subchapter)
      of any original plan member shall continue unchanged while he or she  is
      an original plan member.
        (3)  The cash benefits payable under the provisions of this subchapter
      to, or upon the death of, an original  plan  member  in  active  service
      shall  be  paid from the contingent reserve fund. Upon the retirement of
      an original plan member, or upon his or her death in the performance  of
      duty,  an  amount  equal  to  the  retirement  allowance reserve for the
      retirement allowance payable on account of his or her city-service as  a
      member,  shall  be  transferred  from the contingent reserve fund to the
      retirement allowance reserve fund.
        c. (1) Such board shall certify to the commissioner who  shall  deduct
      from  the  compensation  of  each original plan member on each and every
      payroll of such member for each and every payroll period, the proportion
      of his or her earnable compensation which  he  or  she  is  required  to
      contribute  to the pension fund as provided for by subdivision b of this
      section, provided that such proportion shall be reduced  on  account  of
      any program for increased-take-home-pay to the extent and for the period
      prescribed by any laws providing for such a reduction for members of the
      pension  fund,  as  applicable to such member. In determining the amount
      earnable by a member in a payroll period, such board  may  consider  the
      rate  of  compensation  payable  to  such member on the first day of the
      payroll period as continuing throughout such  payroll  period  and  such
    
      board  may  omit deductions from compensation for any period less than a
      full payroll period if an employee was not a member on the first day  of
      the  payroll  period. To facilitate the making of deductions, such board
      may  modify the contribution required of any member by such an amount as
      shall not exceed one-tenth of one per cent of the compensation upon  the
      basis  of which such contribution is to be made. The deductions provided
      herein shall be  made  notwithstanding  that  the  minimum  compensation
      provided  by  law  for any member shall be reduced thereby. Every member
      shall be deemed to consent and agree to the reductions made and provided
      for herein  and  shall  receipt  in  full  for  his  or  her  salary  or
      compensation,  and  payment  less  such  deductions  shall be a full and
      complete discharge and acquittance of all claims and demands  whatsoever
      for  the  services  rendered by such person during the period covered by
      such payment, except his or her claim to the benefits to which he or she
      may  be  entitled  under  the  provisions  of   this   subchapter.   The
      commissioner  shall certify to the comptroller on each and every payroll
      the amounts to be deducted. Each of such amounts shall be  deducted  and
      when  deducted shall be paid into the contingent reserve fund, and shall
      be  credited  to  an  individual  account  of  the  member  from   whose
      compensation such deduction was made.
        (2) Notwithstanding any other provision of law to the contrary, in the
      case of any original plan member whose years of fire service credited to
      him  or  her  equal  or exceed the minimum period for service retirement
      elected by him or her, that part of any earnable  compensation  of  such
      member  earned  after  completion of such minimum period and on or after
      July first, nineteen hundred  sixty-nine,  which  part  is  obtained  by
      multiplying  such  compensation  by  the  excess,  if any, of his or her
      normal rate of contribution as an original plan member  (as  defined  in
      subdivision  seventeen  of  section 13-313 of this subchapter) rate over
      five per cent, shall not be deducted under subdivision b of this section
      and paragraph one of this  subdivision  c.  Nothing  contained  in  this
      paragraph  two shall affect or impair any rights conferred upon any such
      member by section 13-326 of this subchapter.
        d. In addition to the  contributions  from  compensation  hereinbefore
      provided,  any  original  plan  member  may  redeposit in the contingent
      reserve fund by a single payment an amount equal  to  the  total  amount
      which  he  or  she  withdrew  previously  therefrom  as provided in this
      subchapter. Such additional amount so deposited shall become a  part  of
      his  or  her accumulated contributions. The accumulated contributions of
      an original plan member withdrawn as provided in this  subchapter  shall
      be paid out of the contingent reserve fund.

      subchapter  and/or  subdivision  b  of section 13-327 of this subchapter
      shall be reduced in the amount and for  the  period  prescribed  by  the
      program  provided  for by the preceding subdivisions of this section and
      subdivision b of section four  hundred  eighty  of  the  retirement  and
      social security law.
        (2)  (i) In the case of any elective improved benefits plan member (as
      defined in subdivision four-g of  section  13-313  of  this  subchapter)
      whose  election  of  such plan becomes effective on the starting date of
      the improved benefits plan (as  such  date  is  defined  in  subdivision
      twenty-seven  of  such  section  13-313) and prior to the termination of
    
      such reduction as provided for in subdivision b of section four  hundred
      eighty  of  the  retirement  and  social  security  law,  such reduction
      pursuant to paragraph one of this subdivision  e  shall  begin  on  such
      starting date.
        (ii)  In  the case of any elective improved benefits plan member whose
      election of such plan becomes effective after  such  starting  date  and
      prior  to such time of termination, such reduction pursuant to paragraph
      one of this subdivision shall  begin  on  the  effective  date  of  such
      election.
        (iii)  In  the  case of any non-elective improved benefits plan member
      (as  defined  in  subdivision  four-h  of  such  section  13-313)  whose
      membership in the pension fund begins on or after such starting date and
      prior  to such time of termination, such reduction pursuant to paragraph
      one of this subdivision shall begin on the date of commencement  of  the
      membership of such member in the pension fund.
        (iv)  Such  reduction  shall  end,  in  the case of each such elective
      improved benefits plan member or  non-elective  improved  benefits  plan
      member  above  referred  to  in  this  paragraph  two,  at  such time of
      termination provided for in subdivision b of section four hundred eighty
      of the retirement and social security law.
        (3) The contribution of each improved benefits plan  member  which  is
      made  pursuant  to  the  applicable provisions of section 13-315 of this
      subchapter and/or subdivision b of section 13-327 of this subchapter and
      which is reduced  as  provided  for  in  this  subdivision  e  shall  be
      exclusive  of  any  increase thereof pursuant to subdivisions c and d of
      such section 13-327 or any reduction thereof pursuant to subdivision one
      of section one hundred  thirty-eight-b  of  the  retirement  and  social
      security law.
        (4)  The  reduction of the contribution of each improved benefits plan
      member as prescribed by the preceding  provisions  of  this  subdivision
      shall be subject to waiver of such member as provided in paragraph seven
      of  this  subdivision  and  shall  take  precedence  over  the  member's
      privilege under subdivision one of section one hundred thirty-eight-b of
      the retirement and social security law, to decrease his or  her  annuity
      contribution  for the purpose of paying his or her contributions for old
      age, survivors and disability insurance coverage or the tax imposed upon
      him or her pursuant to the federal insurance contribution act.
        (5) For  such  period  of  time  as  the  reduction  pursuant  to  the
      provisions  of  the preceding paragraphs of this subdivision shall be in
      effect with respect to an improved benefits plan  member,  contributions
      shall be made to the contingent reserve fund by the city at a rate fixed
      by  the actuary, which shall be computed to be sufficient to provide (i)
      the pension-providing-for-increased-take-home-pay which is or may become
      payable on account of such member as an improved benefits  plan  member,
      and  (ii)  the death benefit which is or may become payable hereunder in
      the case of any such member who  is  an  improved  benefits  member  not
      subject  to  article eleven (as defined in subdivision four-i of section
      13-313 of this subchapter).
        (6)      Such      a      death      benefit      and      such      a
      pension-providing-for-increased-take-home-pay payable with respect to an
      improved    benefits    plan    member    shall    be    based    on   a
      reserve-for-increased-take-home-pay, which shall be a sum consisting  of
      the  total  of  all products obtained by multiplying the compensation of
      the improved benefits plan member, during each period  of  reduction  of
      member  contributions under the preceding paragraphs of this subdivision
      by the percentage of reduction of his or  her  contributions  applicable
      thereunder  with  respect  of such period, plus regular interest on such
      sum, and additional interest, if any, thereon.
    
        (7) Where an improved benefits plan member's rate of  contribution  is
      reduced     because     the     city     contributes     towards     the
      pension-providing-for-increased-take-home-pay pursuant to this  section,
      such   improved   benefits  plan  member  may  by  written  notice  duly
      acknowledged  and filed with the pension fund within one year after such
      reduction or within one year after he  or  she  last  became  a  member,
      whichever  is  later,  elect  to  waive such reduction. One year or more
      after the filing thereof, an improved benefits plan member may  withdraw
      any  such  waiver by written notice duly acknowledged and filed with the
      pension fund. Where an improved benefits plan member makes  an  election
      to  waive  such reduction he or she shall contribute to the pension fund
      as otherwise provided by the applicable provisions of section 13-315  of
      this subchapter and/or section 13-322 of this subchapter.
        (8)  An  improved  benefits  plan  member  who  waives  a reduction of
      contribution pursuant to paragraph seven  of  this  subdivision  or  who
      elects  or  has elected to discontinue his or her contributions pursuant
      to subdivision b of section 13-327 of this subchapter shall be  entitled
      to a pension-providing-for-increased-take-home-pay and death benefits in
      the  same cases and to the same extent as if such waiver or election had
      not been made.

Section 13-327 ::    
        
     
        ยง  13-327  Contributions  of  improved benefits plan members and their
      use; annuity savings fund. a. (1) The annuity savings fund shall be  the
      fund  in  which shall be accumulated deductions from the compensation of
      improved benefits plan members to provide for their annuities and  their
      withdrawal allowances.
        (2)  Upon  the  basis  of  the  tables  herein authorized, and regular
      interest,  the  actuary  of  such  board  shall   determine   for   each
      non-elective  improved  benefits  plan member (as defined in subdivision
      four-h  of  section  13-313  of  this  subchapter)  the  proportion   of
      compensation  which,  when  deducted  from  each  payment  of his or her
      prospective earnable compensation prior to his or  her  eligibility  for
      retirement  and  accumulated  at regular interest upon the attainment of
      the minimum period of service retirement elected by him or her, shall be
      computed to provide, at that  time,  an  annuity  equal  to  twenty-five
      seventy-fifths  of  the pension then allowable to him or her for service
      as a member. Such proportion of compensation shall be computed to remain
      constant.
        (3) The proportion of earnable compensation required to be applied  in
      making deductions from the compensation of an elective improved benefits
      plan  member (as defined in subdivision four-g of section 13-313 of this
      subchapter) shall be computed  as  provided  for  in  subdivision  i  of
      section 13-315 of this subchapter.
        (4)  In  any  case  where the membership of any improved benefits plan
      member is terminated and he or she thereafter acquires a status whereby,
      under the applicable  provisions  of  this  subchapter,  he  or  she  is
      required  to  make  member  contributions  as  an improved benefits plan
      member consisting of a proportion of his or  her  earnable  compensation
      (before  reduction on account of any program for increased-take-home-pay
      in effect) other than the proportion of his or her earnable compensation
      (before reduction on account of any such  program)  which,  before  such
      termination  of  membership, was required to be deducted from his or her
      earnable compensation as his  or  her  member  contributions,  such  new
      proportion  of  his or her earnable compensation required to be deducted
      as his or her member contributions as an improved benefits  plan  member
      shall  be  fixed  pursuant  to  the  provisions of paragraph two of this
      subdivision  a  and  such  subsequent  required  deductions   from   the
      compensation  of  such  member  shall  be  made on the basis of such new
      proportion of his or her earnable compensation.
        b. Such board shall certify to the commissioner who shall deduct  from
      the compensation of each improved benefits plan member on each and every
      payroll of such member for each and every payroll period, the proportion
      of  his  or  her earnable compensation so computed. Such board shall not
      certify nor shall  the  commissioner  make  any  deduction  for  annuity
      purposes  from  the compensation of an improved benefits plan member who
      elects not to contribute if his or her total service is  such  as  would
      entitle  a  new entrant to retire for service on a pension not less than
      seventy-five per  cent  of  one-half  of  his  or  her  annual  earnable
      compensation  on  the  date  of  retirement.  In  determining the amount
      earnable by an improved benefits plan member in a payroll  period,  such
      board  may  consider  the rate of compensation payable to such member on
      the first day of  the  payroll  period  as  continuing  throughout  such
      payroll  period and such board may omit deductions from compensation for
      any period less than a full payroll period if such an employee was not a
      member on the first day of the  period.  To  facilitate  the  making  of
      deductions,  such  board  may  modify the deduction required by any such
      member of such amount as shall not exceed one-tenth of one per  cent  of
      the  compensation  upon the basis of which such deduction is to be made.
      The deductions provided herein shall be made  notwithstanding  that  the
    
      minimum  compensation  provided  by  law  for any improved benefits plan
      member shall be reduced thereby. Every  improved  benefits  plan  member
      shall be deemed to consent and agree to the deductions made and provided
      for  by  the  applicable provisions of section 13-315 of this subchapter
      and/or this section and shall receipt in full for his or her  salary  or
      compensation,  and  payment  less  such  deductions  shall be a full and
      complete discharge and acquittance of all claims and demands  whatsoever
      for  the  services  rendered by such person during the period covered by
      such payment, except his or her claim to the benefits to which he or she
      may  be  entitled  under  the  provisions  of   this   subchapter.   The
      commissioner  shall certify to the comptroller on each and every payroll
      the amounts to be deducted. Each of such amounts shall be  deducted  and
      when  deducted shall be paid into the annuity savings fund, and shall be
      credited, together with regular interest, to an  individual  account  of
      the  member  from whose compensation such deduction was made. The method
      of  computation  and  deductions  prescribed  by  this  subdivision  and
      subdivision  a  of  this  section shall be appropriately modified in the
      case of an improved benefits plan member for whom a  rate  is  otherwise
      fixed pursuant to section 13-326 of this subchapter.
        c.  In addition to the computed deductions, any improved benefits plan
      member may elect to contribute at a rate fifty percentum  in  excess  of
      that  heretofore  provided,  for  the  purpose  of purchasing additional
      annuity.  In  computing  the  amount  of  such   additional   rate   any
      modification  of  the  normal  rate  pursuant  to section 13-326 of this
      subchapter shall be disregarded. These additional contributions shall be
      credited to  the  annuity  savings  fund  with  regular  interest.  Such
      additional  contributions  shall  not  enter  into  the  computation for
      allowance on ordinary disability  retirement  as  described  in  section
      13-352  of this subchapter. A member may elect to discontinue his or her
      additional contributions at any time.
        d. In  addition  to  the  deductions  from  compensation  hereinbefore
      provided, any improved benefits plan member may redeposit in the annuity
      savings  fund  by  a  single payment an amount equal to the total amount
      which he or she  withdrew  previously  therefrom  as  provided  in  this
      subchapter.  Such  amount so deposited shall become a part of his or her
      accumulated  deductions.  The  accumulated  deductions  of  an  improved
      benefits  plan  member withdrawn as provided in this subchapter shall be
      paid out of the annuity savings fund. Upon  retirement  of  an  improved
      benefits  plan  member,  his  or  her  accumulated  deductions  shall be
      transferred from such fund to the annuity reserve fund.

      picked  up  for  the  purchase  of  credit for military service shall be
      deposited in the employer contribution account in  accordance  with  the

      as the case may be; and
        (iii) the determination of the amount of any retirement  allowance  or
      other  pension  fund  benefit payable to or on account of such member or

      such member, and such member's gross compensation (as such  compensation
      would  be  in  the absence of a pick up program applicable to him or her

      included  in  the  total  accumulated  contributions  (as   defined   in
      subdivision  seven  of  section  13-313  of this subchapter) of any such
      member who is an original plan member, and  (iii)  as  included  in  the

      benefits plan member shall accrue in favor of such member and be payable
      by the city at the same rate, for the same time  periods,  in  the  same
      manner and under the same circumstances as interest would be required to
      accrue  in favor of the member and be payable by the city on such picked
      up contributions if they were made by the member in the  absence  of  an
      employer  pick up program applicable to such member under the provisions

      member  paid  into the annuity savings fund by the city pursuant to this

      amount of such picked up contributions is maintained.
        (6) Nothing contained in this subdivision  d  shall  be  construed  as
      granting  member  contributions picked up under this section any status,
      under federal law, other than as  employer  contributions,  pursuant  to
      subsection  h  of  section  four  hundred  fourteen of the United States

      liability  of the pension fund which shall be an amount equal to the sum
      of (A) the total liability for all benefits as  determined  pursuant  to

      as calculated by the actuary in accordance with subparagraph (b) of this
      paragraph, shall be determined as of June thirtieth of the second fiscal
      year preceding the fiscal year  in  which  the  normal  contribution  is
      payable,  provided,  however,  that  (i)  the actuary shall use for such
      calculations the mortality and other tables that are applicable  at  the
      time he or she performs such calculations; (ii) the total funds on hand,
      as  determined  by  the  actuary pursuant to sub-item (G) of item (i) of
      subparagraph (b) of this paragraph, shall be adjusted by adding to  such
      amount  the  present  value of all employer contributions required to be
      paid into the contingent reserve fund in the fiscal year next  preceding
      the  fiscal  year  in  which  the  normal  contribution  is  payable, as
      determined  by  the  actuary;  and  (iii)  the  present  value  of   the
      prospective  future  salaries of all members, as computed by the actuary
      for the purposes of item (ii) of subparagraph  (b)  of  this  paragraph,
      shall  be  reduced  by  the present value of the salaries expected to be
      paid to all members in the fiscal year next preceding the fiscal year in
      which the normal contribution is payable, as determined by the actuary.
        (b) The normal rate of contribution  shall  be  the  rate  per  centum
      obtained:
        (i) by deducting from the amount of such total liability the sum of:
        (A)  (1)  the  amount obtained by adding together the present value of
      all required future revised unfunded accrued liability contributions and
      the present value of all required future payments of installments of the
      nineteen  hundred  eighty   unfunded   accrued   liability   adjustment,
      determined  pursuant  to  subparagraph  (e)  of  paragraph three of this
      subdivision b, if such adjustment is a charge; or
        (2) the remainder obtained by subtracting from the  present  value  of
      all  required  future  unfunded  accrued  liability  contributions,  the
      present value of all future installments of the nineteen hundred  eighty
    
      unfunded  accrued  liability adjustment required to be credited, if such
      nineteen hundred eighty adjustment is a credit;
        (3)  minus (whether (1) or (2) of this sub-item (A) is applicable) the
      present value  of  all  future  installments  of  the  nineteen  hundred
      eighty-two unfunded accrued liability adjustment; and
        (A-1)  the  present  value  of all future installments of the nineteen
      hundred eighty-five unfunded  accrued  liability  adjustment  determined
      pursuant  to  subparagraph (g) of paragraph three of this subdivision b;
      and
        (B) the present value of all required future balance  sheet  liability
      contributions,  plus,  in  the  case  of the determination of the normal
      contribution payable in fiscal year  nineteen  hundred  eighty--nineteen
      hundred  eighty-one,  the  present value, as of June thirtieth, nineteen
      hundred eighty,  of  the  payment  of  interest  on  the  balance  sheet
      liability  as required by item (iv) of subparagraph (a) of paragraph one
      of this subdivision b; and
        (C) the present value of all required future member  contributions  of
      original  plan  members  (as  defined  in  subdivision four-b of section
      13-313 of this subchapter); and
        (D) the present value of all future member contributions on account of
      dependent benefits; and
        (E) the present value of all required  future  payments,  pursuant  to
      section  13-704  of  this  title, of installments of losses in excess of
      installments of gains on dispositions of securities within  the  meaning
      of such section; and
        (F)  in  the  case  of  the  determination  of the normal contribution
      payable in each fiscal year commencing with fiscal year nineteen hundred
      ninety-five--nineteen hundred ninety-six, the present  value  of  future
      member contributions of all members; and
        (G) the total funds on hand, including the amount of any unpaid moneys
      appropriated  pursuant  to section 13-334 of this subchapter and, in the
      case of the determination of the normal  contribution  payable  in  each
      fiscal    year    commencing   with   fiscal   year   nineteen   hundred
      ninety-five--nineteen hundred ninety-six, including the  amount  in  the
      annuity savings fund; and
        (H)  the  present  value  of  all other future installments of accrued
      liability contributions to the pension fund required by  the  applicable
      provisions  of  section  13-638.3 of this title which are not covered by
      the preceding subitems of this item (i); and
        (ii) by dividing the remainder by one per centum of the present  value
      of  the  prospective  future salaries of all members, as computed by the
      actuary on the basis of the latest mortality and service tables  adopted
      pursuant  to  section  13-321  of  this  subchapter, and on the basis of
      regular interest. The normal rate  of  contribution  determined  by  the
      actuary  shall  not be less than zero, shall be certified by the actuary
      after each such valuation and shall continue in  force  until  the  next
      succeeding valuation and certification.
        (c)(i)  The amount of the normal contribution due from the city to the
      contingent reserve fund in each city fiscal year,  commencing  with  the
      nineteen  hundred  eighty--nineteen  hundred  eighty-one fiscal year and
      ending with the two thousand four--two thousand five fiscal year,  shall
      be  the  amount obtained by multiplying the normal rate of contribution,
      as determined by the actuary as of June thirtieth  next  preceding  such
      fiscal  year,  by  the  aggregate annual salaries of the members on such
      next preceding June thirtieth, and shall be payable in such fiscal  year
      next  following such June thirtieth, together with such regular interest
      thereon which may be due, if any, as calculated by the actuary.
    
        (ii) The amount of the normal contribution due from the  city  to  the
      contingent  reserve  fund  in each city fiscal year, commencing with the
      two thousand five--two thousand six fiscal year,  shall  be  the  amount
      obtained  by  multiplying the normal rate of contribution, as determined
      by the actuary as of the second June thirtieth preceding the fiscal year
      in  which  the  normal  contribution  is payable, in accordance with the
      provisions of subparagraphs (a-1) and (b)  of  this  paragraph,  by  the
      aggregate  amount  of  the  salaries  expected to be paid to the members
      during the fiscal year in which the normal contribution is  payable,  as
      determined by the actuary, and such normal contribution shall be payable
      in  the  second fiscal year following the June thirtieth as of which the
      normal rate of contribution is determined, together  with  such  regular
      interest thereon which may be due, if any, as calculated by the actuary.
        (iii)  In  the case of the normal contribution payable in the nineteen
      hundred eighty--nineteen hundred  eighty-one  fiscal  year  and  in  any
      subsequent  fiscal  year,  the  term "regular interest", as used in this
      subparagraph  (c),  shall  mean  regular  interest  as  defined  by  the
      applicable  provisions  of paragraph (f) or paragraph (g) of subdivision
      eight of section 13-313 of this subchapter.
        (d)(i) For the purposes of this subparagraph (d), the  terms  "pension
      fund,  subchapter  one" and "fire subchapter one beneficiary" shall have
      the meanings set forth in paragraphs one  and  three,  respectively,  of
      subdivision a of section 13-312.1 of this chapter.
        (ii)  The  amount  of the normal contribution due from the city to the
      contingent   reserve   fund   in    the    city's    nineteen    hundred
      ninety-four--nineteen  hundred ninety-five fiscal year shall be equal to
      the  amount  of  the  normal  contribution  for  such  fiscal  year,  as
      calculated in accordance with the provisions of subparagraph (c) of this
      paragraph,  minus  the sum (calculated by the actuary to reflect regular
      interest in accordance with the provisions of subparagraph (c)  of  this
      paragraph) of the following:
        (A)  the  amount of the assets deemed to have been transferred on July
      first, nineteen hundred ninety-four from pension fund, subchapter one to
      this pension fund  and  credited  to  the  contingent  reserve  fund  in
      accordance  with  the  provisions  of  subdivisions  b  and g of section
      13-312.1 of this chapter, as if such transfer actually had been made  on
      such July first; and
        (B)  the  amount  of  the benefits payable during the nineteen hundred
      ninety-four--nineteen hundred ninety-five fiscal year by  pension  fund,
      subchapter one to fire subchapter one beneficiaries; and
        (C)  the  amount  of supplemental benefits payable during the nineteen
      hundred ninety-four--nineteen hundred ninety-five fiscal year, including
      the increase in certain of such benefits provided by paragraph  four  of
      subdivision  a  of section 13-687 of this title, as added by the chapter
      of  the  laws  of  nineteen  hundred  ninety-five   which   added   this
      subparagraph,  by  the  city supplemental pension fund established under
      section 13-650 of this title to fire subchapter one beneficiaries.
        (e) (i) Notwithstanding the preceding subparagraphs of this  paragraph
      or  any  other provision of law to the contrary, the normal contribution
      payable to the contingent reserve  fund  in  fiscal  year  two  thousand
      eleven--two  thousand  twelve, and in each fiscal year thereafter, shall
      be the entry age normal  contribution,  as  determined  by  the  actuary
      pursuant  to this subparagraph in a manner consistent with the entry age
      actuarial cost method. The actuary shall determine the entry age  normal
      contribution  for  each  such  fiscal  year  as of June thirtieth of the
      second fiscal year preceding  the  fiscal  year  in  which  such  normal
      contribution  is payable, based on the latest mortality and other tables
      applicable at the time he or she performs  such  calculations,  and  the
    
      valuation rate of interest as provided for the pension fund in paragraph
      two of subdivision b of section 13-638.2 of this title.
        (ii)  In  calculating the entry age normal contribution payable in any
      such fiscal year pursuant to this subparagraph, the actuary, in  his  or
      her   discretion,  may  make  certain  adjustments  in  the  calculation
      methodology, provided that such adjustments are  generally  accepted  as
      consistent  with  the entry age actuarial cost method, and are designed,
      in general, to fund, on a level basis  over  the  working  lifetimes  of
      members  from  their  ages  at  entry,  the  actuarial  present value of
      benefits to which such members  are  expected  to  become  entitled,  as
      determined  by  the  actuary. Such generally accepted adjustments in the
      calculation methodology, in the discretion of the actuary, may  include,
      but  are  not  limited  to,  the  calculation  of  the  entry age normal
      contribution (A) on an individual member basis by calculating the amount
      of the entry age normal contribution  attributable  to  each  individual
      member,  and then adding together such individual member amounts, (B) on
      an aggregate basis for all members or  (C)  on  any  combination  of  an
      individual  member basis and an aggregate basis which is consistent with
      the entry age actuarial cost method, and  the  preceding  provisions  of
      this item.
        (iii)  For  each  such  fiscal  year,  the  actuary,  in  his  or  her
      discretion, shall determine, in accordance with the provisions  of  item
      (ii) of this subparagraph, the methodology for calculating the entry age
      normal contribution payable for that particular fiscal year.
        (iv) The methodology determined by the actuary in accordance with item
      (iii)  of this subparagraph may provide for the actuary to calculate the
      entry age normal contribution on  an  individual  member  basis  by  (A)
      multiplying  the  entry age normal contribution rate for each individual
      member, as determined by the actuary, by the salary expected to be  paid
      to  that member during the fiscal year in which such normal contribution
      is payable, and (B) calculating the sum  of  the  individual  entry  age
      normal  contributions  attributable to all such members. The actuary, in
      his or her discretion, may make any adjustments to such methodology  for
      determining  the  entry  age  normal contribution on an individual basis
      which he or she deems appropriate, and which  are  consistent  with  the
      provisions of item (ii) of this subparagraph.
        (v)  In  the alternative, the methodology determined by the actuary in
      accordance with item (iii) of this  subparagraph  may  provide  for  the
      actuary  to  calculate the entry age normal contribution on an aggregate
      basis by multiplying the entry age  normal  contribution  rate  for  all
      members in the aggregate, as determined by the actuary, by the aggregate
      amount  of  the  salaries  expected to be paid to all members during the
      fiscal year in which the normal contribution is payable. The actuary, in
      his or her discretion, may make any adjustments to such methodology  for
      determining  the  entry  age  normal  contribution on an aggregate basis
      which he or she deems appropriate, and which  are  consistent  with  the
      provisions of item (ii) of this subparagraph.
        (vi)  In the alternative, the methodology determined by the actuary in
      accordance with item (iii) of this  subparagraph  may  provide  for  the
      calculation  of  the  entry  age  normal contribution on any other basis
      which the actuary deems appropriate, and which is  consistent  with  the
      entry  age actuarial cost method and the provisions of item (ii) of this
      subparagraph.
        (vii)  (A)  Where  the  methodology  determined  by  the  actuary   in
      accordance   with   item   (iii)   of  this  subparagraph  requires  the
      determination  of  an  entry  age  normal  contribution  rate  for  each
      individual   member   in   order  to  calculate  the  entry  age  normal
      contribution for each individual member,  the  actuary  shall  determine
    
      such  rate  for  each  such  member  in  accordance  with  the entry age
      actuarial cost method, and such rate, as determined by the  actuary  for
      each  such  member,  shall  be  consistent  with  a  method designed, in
      general,  to  fund,  on  a level basis over the working lifetime of that
      particular member from his or her age at entry,  the  actuarial  present
      value  of  benefits to which such member is expected to become entitled,
      as determined by the actuary.
        (B) Where the methodology determined by the actuary in accordance with
      item (iii) of this subparagraph requires the determination of  an  entry
      age  normal  contribution rate for all members in the aggregate in order
      to calculate the entry age normal contribution for all  members  in  the
      aggregate,  the actuary shall determine such rate in accordance with the
      entry age actuarial cost method, and such rate,  as  determined  by  the
      actuary,  shall  be  consistent  with  a method designed, in general, to
      fund, on a level basis over the working lifetimes of members from  their
      ages  at  entry,  the  actuarial present value of benefits to which such
      members are expected to become entitled, as determined by the actuary.
        (3) (a) The unfunded accrued liability contribution shall be an amount
      determined as prescribed in subparagraphs  (b),  (c)  and  (d)  of  this
      paragraph three.
        (b) (i) The "assumed original unfunded accrued liability contribution"
      shall  be  a  hypothetical  amount  determined  as  provided for in this
      subparagraph (b).
        (ii) On the basis of the actuarial tables adopted pursuant to  section
      13-321  of  this  subchapter  for the purpose of determining the assumed
      original unfunded accrued liability contribution  and  interest  at  the
      rate of five and one-half per centum per annum, there shall be computed,
      as  of  June thirtieth, nineteen hundred seventy-five, the amount of the
      total liability for all benefits provided in this subchapter, in article
      eleven of the retirement and social security law and in  any  other  law
      prescribing  benefits  payable  by  the  pension fund, on account of all
      members and beneficiaries, excluding the liability on account of  future
      increased-take-home-pay contributions.
        (iii) From such total liability computed pursuant to item (ii) of this
      subparagraph (b), there shall be subtracted the sum of:
        (A) the present value, as of such June thirtieth, of all then required
      future member contributions pursuant to the provisions of section 13-325
      of this subchapter, as then in effect; and
        (B)  the  sum  obtained by adding together the total funds on hand and
      the balance sheet liability as of such June thirtieth, as such liability
      is determined pursuant to the provisions of subparagraphs  (c)  to  (i),
      inclusive, of paragraph four of this subdivision b; and
        (C) the present value, as of such June thirtieth, of all then required
      future  payments, pursuant to section 13-704 of this article (as then in
      effect) of installments of losses in excess of installments of gains  on
      dispositions of securities within the meaning of such section; and
        (D)  the  present  value,  as of such June thirtieth, of future normal
      costs of the pension fund, computed pursuant to  the  entry  age  normal
      cost method of determining such normal costs.
        (iv)  The  assumed  original  unfunded  accrued liability contribution
      shall be a hypothetical amount, which, if paid to the  pension  fund  in
      forty  equal  annual  installments,  commencing  with payment of a first
      installment  in  the  city's  nineteen  hundred  seventy-seven--nineteen
      hundred seventy-eight fiscal year, would be the actuarial equivalent, on
      the  basis  of  five  and one-half per centum interest and the actuarial
      tables adopted pursuant to section 13-321 of  this  subchapter  for  the
      purpose  of  determining the assumed original unfunded accrued liability
    
      contributions, of the remainder computed pursuant to item (iii) of  this
      subparagraph (b).
        (c) (i) To the amount of the remainder computed pursuant to item (iii)
      of  subparagraph  (b)  of  this  paragraph  three,  there shall be added
      interest thereon at the rate of five and one-half per centum  per  annum
      for  the  period  from July first, nineteen hundred seventy-five to June
      thirtieth, nineteen hundred eighty.
        (ii) There shall be computed in the manner provided for in item
        (iii) of this subparagraph (c), the discounted value of  each  of  the
      installments   of   the  assumed  original  unfunded  accrued  liability
      contribution which would have been hypothetically payable,  pursuant  to
      the provisions of item (iv) of subparagraph (b) of this paragraph three,
      in   the   city's   nineteen   hundred  seventy-seven--nineteen  hundred
      seventy-eight,   nineteen   hundred   seventy-eight--nineteen    hundred
      seventy-nine,  nineteen  hundred  seventy-nine--nineteen hundred eighty,
      nineteen  hundred  eighty--nineteen  hundred  eighty-one  and   nineteen
      hundred eighty-one--nineteen hundred eighty-two fiscal years.
        (iii) Such discounted value of each such installment shall be computed
      as  of  January  first  of  the  city's second fiscal year preceding the
      fiscal year in which such installment  would  have  been  hypothetically
      payable  and  on  the basis of five and one-half per centum interest per
      annum on the amount of such installment.
        (iv) There shall be computed with respect to such discounted value  of
      each  such  installment,  interest  thereon  from  January first of such
      second fiscal year preceding the fiscal year in which  such  installment
      would  have  been  hypothetically  payable  to  June thirtieth, nineteen
      hundred eighty at the rate of five and one-half per centum per annum.
        (v) The discounted values of all of such installments with respect  to
      such  fiscal  years, computed as provided for in items (ii) and (iii) of
      this subparagraph (c), together with interest on each  such  installment
      as  provided  for  in  item  (iv)  of  this subparagraph, shall be added
      together.
        (vi) From the sum computed pursuant to item (i) of  this  subparagraph
      (c), the sum computed pursuant to item (v) of this subparagraph shall be
      subtracted.
        (d)  (i)  With  respect  to each city fiscal year occurring during the
      period beginning on July first, nineteen hundred eighty  and  ending  on
      June  thirtieth,  nineteen  hundred  eighty-two,  the  revised  unfunded
      accrued  liability  contribution  shall  be  the   annual   installment,
      applicable  to  such  fiscal  year,  of  an amount which, if paid to the
      contingent  reserve  fund  in  thirty-five  equal  annual  installments,
      commencing  with  payment  of a first installment in the city's nineteen
      hundred eighty--nineteen hundred eighty-one fiscal year,  would  be  the
      actuarial  equivalent,  on  the  basis  of seven and one-half per centum
      interest per annum, of the remainder computed pursuant to item  (vi)  of
      subparagraph (c) of this paragraph three.
        (ii) With respect to each city fiscal year occurring during the period
      beginning  on July first, nineteen hundred eighty-two and ending on June
      thirtieth, nineteen hundred eighty-eight, the revised  unfunded  accrued
      liability  contribution  shall  be the annual installment, applicable to
      such fiscal year, of an amount which, if paid to the contingent  reserve
      fund  in thirty-three equal annual installments, commencing with payment
      of   a   first   installment   in   the    city's    nineteen    hundred
      eighty-two--nineteen  hundred  eighty-three  fiscal  year,  would be the
      actuarial equivalent, on the basis of  eight  per  centum  interest  per
      annum,  of  the  present  value,  as of June thirtieth, nineteen hundred
      eighty-two on the basis of seven and one-half per  centum  interest  per
      annum,   of   those  installments  of  the  unfunded  accrued  liability
    
      contribution computed pursuant to item (i)  of  this  subparagraph  (d),
      which  installments  are  hypothetically  allocated  by such item (i) to
      designated city fiscal years succeeding June thirtieth, nineteen hundred
      eighty-two.
        (iii)  With  respect  to  each  city  fiscal year occurring during the
      period beginning on July first, nineteen hundred eighty-eight and ending
      on June thirtieth, two thousand fifteen, the  revised  unfunded  accrued
      liability  contribution  shall  be the annual installment, applicable to
      such fiscal year, of an  amount  which,  when  paid  to  the  contingent
      reserve  fund in twenty-seven equal annual installments, commencing with
      payment  of  a  first  installment  in  the  city's   nineteen   hundred
      eighty-eight--nineteen  hundred  eighty-nine  fiscal  year, shall be the
      actuarial equivalent, on the basis of eight and one-quarter  per  centum
      interest per annum, of the present value, as of June thirtieth, nineteen
      hundred  eighty-eight  on  the  basis  of  eight per centum interest per
      annum,  of  those  installments  of  the  unfunded   accrued   liability
      contribution  computed  pursuant  to item (ii) of this subparagraph (d),
      which installments are hypothetically allocated by  such  item  (ii)  to
      designated city fiscal years succeeding June thirtieth, nineteen hundred
      eighty-eight.
        (e)  (i)  The  nineteen  hundred  eighty  unfunded  accrued  liability
      adjustment shall be an amount determined as prescribed  in  items  (ii),
      (iii), (iv) and (v) of this subparagraph (e).
        (ii)  (A)  Upon the basis of the actuarial tables in effect as of June
      thirtieth, nineteen hundred eighty for valuation purposes  and  interest
      at  the  rate of seven and one-half per centum per annum, there shall be
      determined, as of June thirtieth, nineteen hundred eighty, the amount of
      the total liability for all benefits provided  in  this  subchapter,  in
      article  eleven  of  the  retirement  and social security law and in any
      other law prescribing benefits payable by the pension fund,  on  account
      of  all members and beneficiaries, excluding the liability on account of
      future increased-take-home-pay contributions.
        (B) From such total liability computed pursuant  to  sub-item  (A)  of
      this item (ii), there shall be subtracted the sum of:
        (1)  the present value, as of June thirtieth, nineteen hundred eighty,
      of all future normal costs, computed pursuant to the  entry  age  normal
      cost method of determining such normal costs; and
        (2)  the  present  value,  as  of  such  June thirtieth, of all future
      installments of the balance sheet liability contribution (as defined  in
      paragraph four of this subdivision b); and
        (3) the present value, as of such June thirtieth, of all then required
      future   payments,   pursuant  to  section  13-704  of  this  title,  of
      installments  of  losses  in  excess  of  installments   of   gains   on
      dispositions of securities within the meaning of such section; and

      shall be subtracted from the former amount and the  remainder  resulting
      from such subtraction shall constitute a charge.
        (B)  If the amount computed pursuant to item (ii) of this subparagraph
      (e) is smaller than  the  amount  computed  pursuant  to  item  (vi)  of

      subtracted from the latter amount and the remainder resulting from  such
      subtraction shall constitute a credit.
        (iv)  (A)  If  the  remainder  computed pursuant to item (iii) of this
      subparagraph is a charge, the nineteen hundred eighty  unfunded  accrued
      liability adjustment shall be an amount which, if paid to the contingent
      reserve  fund  in  thirty  equal  annual  installments,  commencing with
      payment  of  a  first  installment  in  the  city's   nineteen   hundred
      eighty--nineteen  hundred eighty-one fiscal year, would be the actuarial
      equivalent, on the basis of seven and one-half per centum  interest  per
      annum, of such remainder.
        (B)  If  the  remainder  computed  pursuant  to  item  (iii)  of  this
      subparagraph is a credit, the nineteen hundred eighty  unfunded  accrued
      liability  adjustment  shall  be  an amount which, if credited in thirty
      equal annual installments (the first of  which  installments  is  to  be
      credited   in  the  city's  nineteen  hundred  eighty--nineteen  hundred
      eighty-one fiscal year) in reduction of the amounts which the city would
      otherwise be required to pay to the contingent reserve fund pursuant  to
      subparagraph  (a)  of  paragraph  one of this subdivision b or otherwise
      pursuant to law, would be the actuarial  equivalent,  on  the  basis  of

        (4)  (a)  As  used  in  this section, the following words and phrases,
      unless a different meaning is plainly required  by  the  context,  shall
      have the following meanings:
        (i)  (A)  "Normal  contribution for balance sheet liability purposes."
      The hypothetical amount which the assumed normal contribution payable in
      each city fiscal year occurring during  the  period  beginning  on  July
      first,  nineteen  hundred  seventy-four  and  ending  on June thirtieth,
      nineteen hundred eighty would  have  equalled  if  such  assumed  normal
      contribution  had been required by law to be paid to the pension fund in
      the city fiscal year in which the obligation to make such assumed normal
      contribution accrued and  such  assumed  normal  contribution  had  been
      required by law to be determined in the manner provided for in sub-items
      (B), (C) and (D) of this item (i).
        (B)  Upon the basis of the mortality and other tables adopted pursuant
      to section 13-321 of this subchapter for the purpose of determining  the
      balance  sheet  liability  contribution and interest at the rate of five
      and one-half per centum per annum, the actuary shall  determine,  as  of
      June  thirtieth  next  preceding  each  such  fiscal year for which such
      assumed normal contribution is being determined (hereinafter referred to
      as the "subject fiscal year") the amount of the then total liability for
      all benefits provided in this  subchapter,  in  article  eleven  of  the
      retirement  and  social  security  law  and in any other law prescribing
      benefits payable by the pension fund, on account of all then members and
      beneficiaries, excluding the then liability on account of future  annual
      contributions,  for  balance  sheet  liability  purposes,  on account of
      accumulations-for-increased-take-home-pay (as defined in  item  (iv)  of
      this subparagraph (a)), if any.
        (C)  The  assumed  normal  rate  of  contribution  with respect to the
      subject fiscal year shall be the rate per centum obtained:
        (i) by deducting from the amount of such total liability, the sum of:
        (A) the present value of all then  required  future  unfunded  accrued
      liability contributions for balance sheet liability purposes (as defined
      in item (ii) of this subparagraph (a)); and
        (B)   the   present   value   of   all  then  required  future  annual
      contributions, for balance  sheet  liability  purposes,  on  account  of
      amortization  of losses on dispositions of certain securities within the
      meaning of section 13-704 of this article (as defined in item  (iii)  of
      this subparagraph (a)); and
        (C) the present value of all then required future member contributions
      on account of dependent benefits; and
        (D) the amount obtained by adding together the total funds on hand and
      the balance sheet liability as of such June thirtieth next preceding the
      subject fiscal year; and
        (ii)  by  dividing the remainder by one per centum of the then present
      value of the prospective future salaries of all members, as computed  on
      the  basis  of  the  mortality  and  service  tables adopted pursuant to
      section 13-321 of this subchapter for the  purpose  of  determining  the
      balance  sheet  liability  contribution, and on the basis of interest at
      the rate of five and one-half per centum per annum.
        (D) The amount of the assumed normal contribution  for  balance  sheet
      liability  purposes  hypothetically  payable  in the subject fiscal year
      shall be the amount obtained (1) by multiplying such assumed normal rate
      of contribution computed with respect to the subject fiscal year by  the
      aggregate  annual  salaries  of  the members as of June thirtieth of the
      subject  fiscal  year  and  (2)  by  adding  to  the  product  of   such
      multiplication interest on such product at the rate of five and one-half
      per centum per annum for a period of six months.
    
        (ii)  "Unfunded  accrued  liability  contribution  for  balance  sheet
      liability purposes." (A) With respect to  the  city's  nineteen  hundred
      seventy-four--nineteen hundred seventy-five fiscal year, such term shall
      mean  a  hypothetical amount which, if paid to the pension fund in forty
      equal annual installments, beginning with payment of a first installment
      in   the   city's   nineteen   hundred   seventy-four--nineteen  hundred
      seventy-five fiscal year, would be  the  actuarial  equivalent,  on  the
      basis of interest at the rate of five and one-half per centum per annum,
      of  the remainder computed in the manner prescribed by sub-items (B) and
      (C) of this item (ii).
        (B) Upon the basis of the actuarial tables adopted  pursuant  to  such

      liability contribution and interest at the rate of five and one-half per
      centum per annum,  there  shall  be  computed,  as  of  June  thirtieth,
      nineteen hundred seventy-four, the amount of the total liability for all
      benefits   provided  by  this  subchapter,  in  article  eleven  of  the
      retirement and social security law and  in  any  other  law  prescribing
      benefits  payable  by  the  pension  fund, on account of all members and
      beneficiaries,  excluding   the   liability   on   account   of   future
      increased-take-home-pay contributions.
        (C)  From  such  total  liability computed pursuant to sub-item (B) of
      this item there shall be subtracted the sum of:
        (1) the present value, as of such June thirtieth, of all then required
      future member contributions pursuant to the provisions of section 13-325
      of this subchapter, as then in effect; and
        (2) the sum obtained by adding together the total funds  on  hand  and
      the balance sheet liability as of such June thirtieth, as such liability
      is  determined  pursuant  to  the provisions of subparagraph (b) of this
      paragraph four; and
        (3) the present value, as of such June thirtieth, of all then required
      future payments, pursuant to section 13-704 of this article (as then  in
      effect)  of installments of losses in excess of installments of gains on
      dispositions of securities within the meaning of such section; and
        (4) the present value, as of such June  thirtieth,  of  future  normal
      costs  of  the  pension  fund, computed pursuant to the entry age normal
      cost method of determining such normal costs.
        (D) With respect to each of the city's fiscal years  occurring  during
      the  period  from  July  first,  nineteen  hundred  seventy-five to June
      thirtieth, nineteen hundred eighty, such term shall mean a  hypothetical
      amount  which,  if  paid  to  the  pension  fund  in  forty equal annual
      installments, beginning with payment  of  a  first  installment  in  the
      city's   nineteen  hundred  seventy-five--nineteen  hundred  seventy-six
      fiscal year, would be the actuarial equivalent, on the basis of interest
      at the rate of five and one-half per centum per annum, of the  remainder
      computed pursuant to sub-items (E) and (F) of this item (ii).
        (E) Upon the basis of the actuarial tables adopted pursuant to section
      13-321  of  this  subchapter  for the purpose of determining the balance
      sheet liability contribution and  interest  at  the  rate  of  five  and
      one-half  per  centum  per  annum,  there  shall be computed, as of June
      thirtieth, nineteen  hundred  seventy-five,  the  amount  of  the  total
      liability  for  all  benefits  provided  by  this subchapter, in article
      eleven of the retirement and social security law and in  any  other  law
      prescribing  benefits  payable  by  the  pension fund, on account of all
      members and beneficiaries, excluding the liability on account of  future
      increased-take-home-pay contributions.
        (F)  From  such  total  liability computed pursuant to sub-item (E) of

      within  the  meaning  of section 13-704 of this article." A hypothetical

      regular  interest  which are required to be paid into such funds in such
      fiscal year wherein such income, interest and dividends  were  received,
      which  interest  is so payable by reason of being required to be allowed

      required  to  make,  in the same fiscal year, the payments prescribed by
      subparagraphs (A) and (B) of this paragraph three, the  amount  of  such
      excess  shall  be  paid  into  the  contingent  reserve  fund as of June

      of this section, the following terms shall mean and include:
        1. "Base fiscal year". Any fiscal year of the  city  beginning  on  or
      after  July  first,  nineteen  hundred sixty-nine, with respect to which
      fiscal year a computation of  earnings  differential,  based  on  equity
      investments made or held by the pension fund during such fiscal year, is
      being made pursuant to this section.
        2.  "Current fiscal year". The fiscal year of the city next succeeding
      the base fiscal year.
        3. "Prior base fiscal year". Any fiscal year of the city which  begins
      on  or  after July first, nineteen hundred sixty-nine and which precedes
      the base fiscal year.
        4."Earnings differential". The amount  (expressed  as  a  positive  or
      negative quantity) by which the equity experience factor (expressed as a
      positive  or  negative  quantity)  with  respect to the base fiscal year
      differs from the interest comparison factor with  respect  to  the  base
      fiscal  year.  If  such  equity  experience  factor is greater than such
      interest comparison factor, the difference  between  the  two  shall  be
      expressed  as a positive quantity. If such interest comparison factor is
      greater than such equity experience factor, the difference  between  the
      two shall be expressed as a negative quantity.
        5.  (a) "Equity experience factor". An amount (expressed as a positive
      or negative quantity) equal to (i) the income earned by the pension fund
      during the base fiscal year from its investments in equities, plus  (ii)
      the  capital gains, realized or unrealized, occurring during such fiscal
      year by reason of such  investments,  less  (iii)  the  capital  losses,
      realized  or  unrealized, occurring during such fiscal year by reason of
      such investments.
        (b) In the event that any equity is sold during the base fiscal  year,
      the  expense  of  such  sale,  including  but  not  limited  to broker's
      commissions, shall be deducted from capital gain  or  added  to  capital
      loss,  in  determining  whether  such  sale produced a capital gain or a
      capital loss and the amount thereof.
        6. "Income". Any yield of  equities,  including  but  not  limited  to
      dividends, other than capital gains.
        7.  "Hypothetical fixed income securities earnings". (a) The aggregate
      of the hypothetical interest yields computed pursuant  to  subparagraphs
      (b), (c) and (d) of this paragraph seven.
        (b)  The  board  shall compute with respect to each investment made or
      maintained by the pension fund in an equity during the base fiscal year,
      the amount of interest  which  would  have  been  hypothetically  earned
      during  such fiscal year, under the methods of calculation prescribed in
      this subparagraph seven, if an  amount  equal  to  such  investment  had
      instead been hypothetically invested in fixed income securities and such
      securities  had  been held by such fund for a period (in the base fiscal
      year) co-extensive with the period during which such equity was held  by
      such fund in the base fiscal year.
        (c)  For  the  purposes  of  this  section,  the  amount  of  any such
      investment in an equity during the base fiscal year shall be  deemed  to
      be:
        (i) the market value of the equity on the first day of the base fiscal
      year,  in the case of any such equity acquired by the pension fund prior
      to the commencement of such fiscal year and held by  such  fund  on  the
      first day of such fiscal year; and
        (ii)  the  total  amount  paid  by  such  fund  to acquire the equity,
      including but not limited to broker's commissions and other expenses  of
      such  acquisition,  in  the case of any such equity which is acquired by
      such fund during the base fiscal year.
    
        (d) For the purposes of this section, the  amount  of  interest  which
      would  have  been  earned by the pension fund on such hypothetical fixed
      income securities during the base fiscal year shall be deemed to be  the
      amount obtained:
        (i)  by  multiplying  the  amount  of  the  investment in such equity,
      determined as prescribed by subparagraph (c) of this paragraph seven, by
      the assumed rate of interest for the base fiscal year; and
        (ii) by prorating the interest so computed,  in  any  case  where  the
      investment  in such equity was maintained by the pension fund for a part
      of the base fiscal year.
        8. "Assumed rate of interest". (a) In  relation  to  any  base  fiscal
      year,  a  hypothetical  rate  of  interest, fixed as hereinafter in this
      paragraph eight prescribed, which shall  be  used  for  the  purpose  of
      computing, pursuant to paragraph seven of this subdivision a, amounts of
      interest  which  would  have  been hypothetically earned on hypothetical
      investments of the pension fund in fixed income securities  during  such
      fiscal year.
        (b)  The  board shall fix the assumed rate of interest with respect to
      each base fiscal year. In the event of a tie vote with  respect  to  the
      fixation  of  such rate, it shall be fixed by the arbitrator designated,
      for the purpose of resolving  disputes,  in  the  collective  bargaining
      agreement   then   in   effect   between  the  city  and  the  uniformed
      firefighters' association of greater New York.  If  such  arbitrator  is
      unable  or  unwilling to serve, or if there be no such agreement then in
      effect, such rate shall be fixed by  an  arbitrator  designated  by  the
      board.  If  there  is  a  tie  vote  as  to  the  designation of such an
      arbitrator, such rate shall be fixed by an arbitrator appointed  by  the
      supreme  court,  on the application of any member of the board. The cost
      of  any  arbitration  pursuant  to  the  foregoing  provisions  of  this
      subparagraph (b) shall be paid from transferable earnings.
        9.  "Six  per  cent  interest  offset". In relation to any base fiscal
      year, the excess, if any, of the hypothetical  fixed  income  securities
      earnings  with respect to such year, over the amount which such earnings
      would be if they had been computed on the basis of an interest  rate  of
      six  per cent, rather than on the basis of the assumed rate of interest;
      provided, however, that there shall be no six per cent  interest  offset
      with  respect  to  any  base  fiscal  year unless the hypothetical fixed
      income securities earnings with respect to such fiscal year exceeds  the
      equity  experience factor with respect to such fiscal year; and provided
      further that no six percent interest offset with  respect  to  any  base
      fiscal year shall in any event exceed the amount obtained by subtracting
      the  equity  experience factor with respect to such fiscal year from the
      hypothetical fixed income  securities  earnings  with  respect  to  such
      fiscal year.
        10. "Interest comparison factor". In relation to any base fiscal year,
      the  amount obtained by subtracting the six per cent interest offset, if
      any, with respect to such  fiscal  year,  from  the  hypothetical  fixed
      income securities earnings with respect to such fiscal year.
        11.  "Cumulative  earnings  differential for the base fiscal year". In
      relation to a base fiscal year, the amount (expressed as a  positive  or
      negative  quantity)  obtained by adding to the earnings differential for
      such base fiscal year, the total of all earnings differentials  for  all
      prior base fiscal years.
        12.  "Transferable  earnings".  In relation to a base fiscal year, the
      total amount required by the provisions of subdivision c of this section

      pension fund to the firefighters' variable supplements fund and the fire
      officers variable supplements fund with respect to all prior base fiscal
      years pursuant to subdivisions c and d of this section.
        14.  "Firefighters'  variable  supplements  fund".  The  firefighters'

      transferable  earnings  for  prior base fiscal years, a sum equal to the
      amount of such excess shall be distributed by the pension  fund  in  the

      by the actuary pursuant to subdivision  e  of  section  13-384  of  this
      chapter  shows  that  for  any base fiscal year, such liabilities exceed

      fiscal  year  pursuant  to  items (i) and (ii) of this subparagraph by a
      fraction, the numerator of which is the amount designated as the  equity
      experience  factor with respect to such base fiscal year by subparagraph

      fiscal year.
        (b) In applying the provisions of this  paragraph  six  for  the  base

      original  plan  member  or  improved benefits plan member, together with
      interest thereon, can be repaid  before  attainment  of  age  sixty-five
      years  by  additional  deductions  of  ten  per  cent  from  his  or her
      compensation made at the same time compensation is paid to  the  member.
      Upon retirement, an original plan member may borrow up to ninety percent
      of  his  or  her  accumulated  contributions.  An improved benefits plan
      member may borrow up  to  ninety  percent  of  his  or  her  accumulated
      deductions.  The  amount  so  borrowed  together  with  regular interest
      applicable to the member (if he or she is an original  plan  member)  or
      creditable  to  his or her account (if he or she is an improved benefits
      plan member) on any unpaid  balance  thereof  shall  be  repaid  to  the

      his or her annuity savings account and due thereto at  the  end  of  the
      calendar  year  in  which he or she became entitled to cancel his or her
      rate. The actuarial equivalent of any unpaid balance of a  loan  at  the

      otherwise payable, except that each loan made pursuant to  this  section

      original  plan  member,  or to his or her accumulated deductions, in the

      accumulated  deductions  at  the  time of such retirement and a pension,
      which, when added to such annuity, will make such  retirement  allowance
      equal to two-thirds of his or her salary as chief of department. For the
      purpose  of  computing the annuity portion of such retirement allowance,
      his or her accumulated deductions shall be the required amount  of  such
      deductions  at  the  time  of  his or her retirement from such position,
      including any amount then remaining unpaid with respect to  his  or  her
      contribution  rate  deficiency  (as defined in subdivision twenty-one of
      such section) 13-313, if any, without any increase resulting from excess
      contributions and  without  any  decrease  resulting  from  withdrawals,
      loans,  optional  modification,  payment of his or her contributions for
      old age and survivor's insurance coverage, or from any other transaction
      authorized by law. For the purposes of  this  subdivision  c,  any  such
      unpaid  amount  of contribution rate deficiency, in the case of any such
      member who becomes an improved benefits plan member before completion of
      his or her minimum period for service retirement,  shall  be  deemed  to
      consist  of  such  amount  plus regular interest thereon from his or her
      date of commencement of  contributions  as  an  improved  benefits  plan
      member  (as  defined  in subdivision nineteen of such section) 13-313 to
      the date of  completion  of  his  or  her  minimum  period  for  service
      retirement.
        d.  If  such  member  was  an  original plan member subject to article
      eleven (as defined in subdivision four-d of such section 13-313) at  the
      time  of  such retirement, such retirement allowance shall be determined
      pursuant to the provisions of subdivision b of this section,  except  to
      the  extent  and  in  the  manner that any such provision is modified by
      article eleven.
        e. If such member was an improved  benefits  plan  member  subject  to
      article eleven (as defined in subdivision four-j of such section) 13-313
      at  the  time  of  such  retirement,  such retirement allowance shall be
      determined pursuant to the provisions of subdivision c of this  section,
      except  to  the  extent  and  in  the  manner that any such provision is
      modified by article eleven.

      contrary, if any condition or  impairment  of  health  is  caused  by  a
      qualifying World Trade Center condition as defined in section two of the

      natural  and proximate result of an accident not caused by such member's
      own willful negligence, unless  the  contrary  be  proved  by  competent
      evidence.
        (b)  The New York City Fire Department Pension Fund (NYCFDPF) board of

      is determined by the head of the retirement system to have a  qualifying
      World  Trade  Center  condition,  as  defined  in  section  two  of  the
      retirement and social security  law,  upon  such  determination  by  the
      NYCFDPF board of trustees, it shall be presumed that such disability was
      incurred  in  the  performance  and discharge of duty as the natural and
      proximate result of an accident not caused by such member's own  willful
      negligence,  and  that the member would have been physically or mentally
      incapacitated for the performance and discharge of duty of the  position
      from  which he or she retired or vested had the condition been known and
      fully developed at the time of the  member's  retirement  or  separation
      from  service  with  vested  rights,  unless  the  contrary is proven by
      competent evidence.
        (b) The NYCFDPF shall consider  a  reclassification  of  the  member's

      shall be deemed to have died as a natural and  proximate  result  of  an
    
      accident  sustained  in  the  performance of duty and not as a result of
      willful negligence on his  or  her  part.  Such  retiree's  or  vestee's
      eligible beneficiary, as set forth in section 13-347 of this subchapter,
      shall be entitled to an accidental death benefit as provided by sections
      13-347  and  13-348  of  this  subchapter,  however, for the purposes of
      determining the salary base upon which the accidental death  benefit  is
      calculated,  the  retiree  or vestee shall be deemed to have died on the
      date of his or her retirement or separation  from  service  with  vested
      rights.  Upon  the retiree's or vestee's death, the eligible beneficiary
      shall make a written application to the head of  the  retirement  system
      within  the  time  for  filing  an  application  for an accidental death
      benefit as set forth in sections 13-347 and 13-348  of  this  subchapter
      requesting  conversion  of  such  retiree's  service,  vested  right  or
      disability retirement benefit to an accidental  death  benefit.  At  the
      time  of  such conversion, the eligible beneficiary shall relinquish all
      rights  to  the  prospective  benefits  payable  under  the  service  or
      disability retirement benefit or vested right to such benefit, including
      any  post-retirement  death  benefits,  since  the retiree's or vestee's
      death. If the eligible beneficiary is not the only beneficiary receiving

      retirement benefit (including, but not limited to, post-retirement death
      benefits  or  benefits  paid or payable pursuant to the retiree's option
      selection), or  that  will  be  eligible  under  the  vested  right  the
      accidental  death  benefit  payments to the eligible beneficiary will be
      reduced by any amounts paid or payable to any other beneficiary.
        4. Notwithstanding any other provision of this code or of any general,
      special or local law, charter, or rule or regulation to the contrary, if
      a member who: (1) has met  the  criteria  of  subdivision  one  of  this
      section;  (2)  dies  in  active service or after separating from service
      with a vested right to deferred payability of  a  retirement  allowance,
      but  prior  to the payability of that retirement allowance; and (3) dies
      from a qualifying World Trade Center condition, as  defined  in  section
      two  of  the  retirement  and  social security law, as determined by the
      applicable head of the retirement system or  applicable  medical  board,
      then  unless  the  contrary be proven by competent evidence, such member
      shall be deemed to have died as a natural and  proximate  result  of  an
      accident  sustained  in  the  performance of duty and not as a result of
      willful  negligence  on  his  or  her  part.  Such   member's   eligible
      beneficiary, as set forth in section 13-347 of this subchapter, shall be
      entitled to an accidental death benefit provided he or she makes written
      application  to  the  head  of the retirement system within the time for
      filing an application for an accidental death benefit as  set  forth  in
      section 13-347 of this subchapter.

      any member, after retirement for disability and while under the  minimum
      period  for service retirement elected by him or her, to undergo medical
      examination. Such examination shall be made at the place of residence of
      such  beneficiary  or  other  place  mutually  agreed  upon.  Upon   the
      completion  of  such  examination  the  medical  board  shall report and
      certify to the board whether such beneficiary is or is  not  totally  or
      partially  incapacitated physically or mentally and whether he or she is
      or is not engaged in or able to engage in a gainful occupation.  If  the
      board  concur  in a report by the medical board that such beneficiary is
      able to engage in a gainful occupation, it shall  certify  the  name  of
      such  beneficiary  to the appropriate civil service commission, state or

      occupation, or should he or she be offered city-service as a  result  of
      the placing of his or her name on a civil service list, such board shall
      reduce  the  amount  of his or her disability retirement allowance to an
      amount which, when added to that then earned by him or her, or  earnable
      by  him  or  her in city-service so offered him or her, shall not exceed
      the current maximum salary for the title next higher than that  held  by
      him  or  her  when he or she was retired. Should the earning capacity of
      such beneficiary be further altered, such board may further alter his or
      her retirement allowance to an amount which shall not exceed the rate of
      retirement allowance upon which he or she  was  originally  retired  but
      which,  subject  to  such  limitation,  shall  equal, when added to that
      earnable by him or her, the current maximum salary for  the  title  next
      higher  than  that  held  by  him or her when he or she was retired. The
      provisions of this section shall  be  executed,  any  provision  of  the
      charter or the code to the contrary notwithstanding.
        b.  Should any member, after retirement for disability and while under
      the minimum period for service retirement elected by him or her,  refuse
      to  submit  to  one  medical  examination  in any year by a physician or
      physicians designated by  the  medical  board,  his  or  her  retirement
      allowance  may  be  discontinued  until  his  or  her withdrawal of such
      refusal. Should such refusal continue for  one  year,  all  his  or  her
      rights in and to such retirement allowance may be revoked by such board.
        c. (1) The provisions of this section shall apply to:
        (i)  any  beneficiary who retired for disability prior to the starting
      date of  the  improved  benefits  plan  (as  such  date  is  defined  in
      subdivision twenty-seven of section 13-313 of this subchapter); and
        (ii)  any  beneficiary  who  becomes  a  beneficiary  by  retiring for
      disability on or after such starting date and who at the  time  of  such
      retirement, is an original plan member.
        (2)  The provisions of this section shall not apply to any beneficiary
      who becomes a beneficiary by retiring for disability and who at the time
      of such retirement is an improved benefits plan member.

      or she was originally retired but which,  subject  to  such  limitation,
      shall  equal,  when  added  to  that earnable by him or her, the current
      maximum salary for the title next higher than that held by  him  or  her
      when  he  or  she  was  retired. The provisions of this section shall be
      executed, any provision of the charter  or  the  code  to  the  contrary
      notwithstanding.
        b.  Should  any  disability  pensioner,  under  the minimum period for
      service retirement elected by him  or  her,  and  who  was  an  improved
      benefits  plan  member  at  the  time  of  his  or  her  retirement  for
      disability, refuse to submit to one medical examination in any year by a
      physician or physicians designated by the  medical  board,  his  or  her
      pension and his or her pension-providing-for-increased-take-home-pay, if
      any,  may  be  discontinued until his or her withdrawal of such refusal.
      Should such refusal continue for one year, all his or her rights in  and
      to        such        pension        and        his        or        her
      pension-providing-for-increased-take-home-pay, if any, may be revoked by
      such board.

      section, an original plan member not subject  to  article  eleven,  upon

        ยง  13-359 Retirement allowances of improved benefits plan members; for
      service. a. Subject to the provisions of subdivision b of this  section,
      upon  retirement  for  service,  an  improved  benefits  plan member not
      subject to article eleven (as defined in subdivision four-i  of  section
      13-313  of  this  subchapter) shall receive a retirement allowance which
      shall consist of:
        1. (a) An annuity based on his or her required annuity savings at  the
      termination  of  his  or  her required minimum period of service, and in
      addition, a pension which when added to the annuity shall  be  equal  to
      one-half  of  his  or  her  annual  earnable compensation on the date of
      retirement, for his or her minimum period of service.  For  the  purpose
      only  of determining the pension portion of the retirement allowance for
      minimum service, such member's annuity under this paragraph one shall be
      computed as it would be, (i) if it were not  reduced  by  the  actuarial
      equivalent of any outstanding loan, (ii) if it were not increased by the
      actuarial  equivalent  of any additional contributions, (iii) if it were
      not reduced by reason of such member's election to decrease his  or  her
      annuity  contributions in order to apply the amount of such reduction in
      payment of his or her contributions for old-age and survivors  insurance
      coverage, (iv) as it would be without any optional modification, and (v)
      as  it  would  be,  in the case of any improved benefits plan member not
      subject to  article  eleven  who  is  subject  to  a  contribution  rate
      deficiency (as defined in subdivision twenty-one of such section 13-313)
      under the provisions of this subchapter, if an amount equal to the whole
      or any part of such deficiency remaining unpaid as of the effective date
      of  such  member's  retirement  for service had been paid to the pension
      fund on  the  earlier  of  (A)  his  or  her  date  of  commencement  of
      contributions  as  an  improved  benefits  plan  member  (as  defined in
      subdivision nineteen of such  section  13-313)  or  (B)  the  date  next
      following  the  date  of  termination  of such member's required minimum
      period of service.
        (b) If such member became an improved benefits plan member  after  the
      date of termination of such member's required minimum-period of service,
      his  or  her  required  annuity savings at the termination of his or her
      required minimum period of service shall be deemed to be  such  member's
      accumulated  contributions  (as  defined in subdivision seven of section
      13-313 of this subchapter) credited to him or her as  an  original  plan
      member  as  of such date of termination, provided, however, that for the
      purpose only of  determining  the  pension  portion  of  the  retirement
      allowance   for  minimum  service,  such  member's  annuity  under  this
      paragraph one shall be computed as it  would  be  under  the  conditions
      prescribed  in  items  (i),  (iv),  and  (v) of subparagraph (a) of this
      paragraph.
        2. For each additional year of service in the uniformed force  of  the
      fire department, or fraction thereof, beyond his or her required minimum
      service, such a member shall be entitled to, in addition to the benefits
      provided in paragraph one of this subdivision a;
        (a)  a  pension  of one-sixtieth of his or her average annual earnings
      from his or her date of eligibility for retirement to the actual date of
      retirement; and
        (b) a pension-providing-for-increased-take-home-pay which shall be the
      actuarial equivalent of the reserve-for-increased-take-home-pay to which
      he or she may be entitled, if any, for all periods of  such  service  in
      the  uniformed  force  of  the  department  rendered  both (1) after the
      completion of such required minimum service in such uniformed force  and
      (2) after December thirty-first, nineteen hundred sixty-six.
        3.  For  each year, or fraction thereof, of service credit transferred
      from the New York city employees' retirement system, or  service  credit
    
      acquired  pursuant to subdivision d of section 13-318 of this subchapter
      or pursuant to the applicable provisions of subdivisions e and f of such
      section, a pension of fifty-five percent of one-sixtieth of his  or  her
      five-year-average  compensation (as defined in subdivision six-a of such
      section 13-313) if such service credit was for service rendered prior to
      October first, nineteen hundred fifty-one  or  seventy-five  percent  of
      one-sixtieth  of  his  or  her  five-year-average  compensation  if such
      service was rendered  subsequent  to  October  first,  nineteen  hundred
      fifty-one.
        4.  (a)  For  service in the uniformed force of the fire department in
      addition to and in excess of his  or  her  required  minimum  period  of
      service,  such  member  shall be entitled to receive, in addition to the
      benefits provided for by the preceding paragraphs of this subdivision a,
      an annuity which shall be determined  in  the  manner  provided  for  in
      subparagraphs (b), (c), (d) and (e) of this paragraph four.
        (b)  There  shall  be  added  together  (i)  the  total  amount of the
      accumulated deductions of such member, if any,  whenever  made,  as  the
      same  are  on  the  date  next preceding the date on which such member's
      retirement  becomes  effective,  including  all   voluntary   additional
      contributions,  whenever made, and (ii) the unpaid amount of any loan of
      such member outstanding as of such date.
        (c) Subject to the provisions of subparagraph (d)  of  this  paragraph
      four,   there   shall  be  determined  the  amount  of  the  accumulated
      deductions, if any, credited to such member with respect to the years of
      his or her service credited as his or her minimum period of service,  as
      such deductions were on the date of completion of such minimum period of
      service  (but  also as such deductions would then be in the absence of a
      loan), excluding, however, from such accumulated deductions:
        (i) the value, as of such completion date, of  all  of  such  member's
      voluntary,  additional  contributions made with respect to such years of
      service credited as his or her minimum period of service;
        (ii) the value,  as  of  such  completion  date,  of  any  accumulated
      deductions  credited with respect to any period of service preceding and
      not included in such period of service credited as such member's minimum
      period of service.
        (d) If such member became an improved benefits plan member  after  the
      date  of  completion  of such member's minimum period of service, his or
      her accumulated deductions with respect to his or her minimum period  of
      service  shall  be deemed to be, only for the purposes of this paragraph
      four, such member's accumulated contributions (as defined in subdivision
      seven of section 13-313 of this subchapter) credited to him or her as an
      original plan member as of such completion  date  with  respect  to  the
      period  of  service credited to such member as his or her minimum period
      of service, as such accumulated contributions would be in the absence of
      a loan, and excluding from such accumulated contributions the value,  as
      of  such date, of any accumulated contributions credited with respect to
      any period of service preceding and  not  included  in  such  period  of
      service credited as such member's minimum period of service.
        (e)  From  the  amount  computed  pursuant to subparagraph (b) of this
      paragraph four, there shall be subtracted the amount  computed  pursuant
      to subparagraph (c) of this paragraph or subparagraph (d) hereof, as the
      case may be.
        (f)  The  annuity  to  which  such member shall be entitled under this
      paragraph four, if any, shall be the actuarial  equivalent,  as  of  the
      date  next  preceding the date on which such member's retirement becomes
      effective, of the remainder computed pursuant  to  subparagraph  (e)  of
      this paragraph four.
    
        b.  Upon  retirement  for  service,  an  improved benefits plan member
      subject to article eleven (as defined  in  subdivision  four-j  of  such
      section  13-313)  shall  receive a retirement allowance consisting of an
      annuity  and  a  pension  determined  pursuant  to  the  provisions   of
      subdivision  a  of  this section, except to the extent and in the manner
      that any such provision is modified by article eleven.

      including service for which credit is granted pursuant to section 15-111
      of the code, but excluding any service credit acquired  by  transfer  or

        (i)  discontinued  "service"  on or after July first, nineteen hundred
      sixty-nine, and prior to the starting date of the improved benefits plan

      and

      with  the  provisions  of  subdivision  b of this section, such deferred
      retirement allowance shall vest automatically.
        (2) Such retirement allowance shall become  payable  on  the  earliest
      date  on which such original plan discontinued member could have retired
      for service if discontinuance had not occurred.
        d. Such  retirement  allowance,  in  the  case  of  an  original  plan
      discontinued  member  not  subject  to  article  eleven  (as  defined in
      subdivision sixteen-a of section 13-313 of this subchapter), shall be:

        (ii)  In  the  case  of any such original plan discontinued member not
      subject to article eleven whose minimum period for service retirement is
      twenty-five years, two percent of his or her final compensation  on  the
      date of his or her discontinuance of "service", multiplied by the number
      of  years  of  "service"  credited  to  him  or  her on the date of such
      discontinuance; and
    
        (2) an amount equal to fifty dollars for  each  year  of  city-service

      discontinued member subject to article eleven (as defined in subdivision
      sixteen-b of such section 13-313) shall consist of an amount  determined
      pursuant  to  the provisions of subdivision d of this section, except to

      discontinuance  had  not  occurred, his or her accumulated contributions
      shall be paid (1) to the beneficiary designated by him or  her  pursuant
      to  section  13-346 of this subchapter to receive his or her accumulated
      contributions in the  event  that  such  contributions  were  to  become

      designation, to his or her estate.
        f. An original plan discontinued member may  elect  any  option  under

      on account of his or her retirement allowance under this section.
        g. Withdrawal of accumulated contributions, in whole or in part, after
      discontinuance  of  "service",  shall  terminate the right to a deferred
      retirement allowance under this section.
        h. If an original plan discontinued member who has not  withdrawn  his
      or  her accumulated contributions in whole or in part shall subsequently
      re-enter "service" before the earliest date on which such original  plan
      discontinued member could have retired for service if discontinuance had
      not  occurred,  he  or  she  shall be entitled to the service credit and
      status to which he or she was entitled immediately prior to his  or  her
      discontinuance of "service".
        i.  (1)  If an original plan discontinued member who has not withdrawn
      his  or  her  accumulated  contributions  in  whole  or  in  part  shall
      subsequently  and  on  or after the earliest date on which such original
      plan  discontinued  member   could   have   retired   for   service   if
      discontinuance   had  not  occurred,  re-enter  "service",  his  or  her
      retirement allowance shall be suspended and forfeited during the  period
      of such "service".
        (2)  (i)  Such  original  plan  discontinued member may again become a
      member of the pension fund if, within  ninety  days  after  his  or  her
      return  to  such  "service",  he  or  she  files  a  duly  executed  and
      acknowledged application for such membership.
        (ii) Subject to the provisions of subparagraphs (iii) and (iv) of this

        (iii) If such original plan discontinued member, at the time of his or
      her  discontinuance  of  "service",  was  an  original plan discontinued
      member not subject to article eleven, he  or  she  shall,  as  such  new
      entrant, continue to be an original plan discontinued member not subject
      to  article  eleven.  If  such original plan discontinued member, at the
      time of his or her discontinuance of "service",  was  an  original  plan
      discontinued  member subject to article eleven, he or she shall, as such
      new entrant, continue to be an original plan discontinued member subject
      to article eleven.
        (iv) Any original plan discontinued member who again becomes a  member
      of  the  pension  fund  pursuant  to the preceding subparagraphs of this
      paragraph two  shall  contribute  to  such  fund  at  the  rate  (before
      modification,  if  any,  to which such original plan discontinued member
      may be entitled pursuant to section 13-326 of this subchapter) at  which
    
      he  or  she  would have been required to contribute if he or she had not
      discontinued "service". The provisions of paragraph two of subdivision c
      of section 13-325 of this subchapter shall not apply to an original plan
      discontinued  member  who  again  becomes  a  member  pursuant  to  this
      paragraph two.
        (3) (i) Upon the subsequent  retirement  of  any  such  original  plan
      discontinued  member  who,  pursuant  to  the provisions of subparagraph
      (iii) of paragraph two of  this  subdivision  i,  is  an  original  plan
      discontinued  member  not  subject to article eleven, he or she shall be
      credited with all of his or her "service" as a member subsequent to  his
      or  her  last  restoration  to  membership  and  he or she shall receive
      therefor a retirement allowance equal to  one-sixtieth  of  his  or  her
      average annual salary or wages from the date of his or her re-entry into
      membership  to  the date of his or her subsequent retirement, multiplied
      by the number of years of "service" rendered by him  or  her  from  such
      date of re-entry.

      discontinued member who, pursuant  to  the  provisions  of  subparagraph
      (iii)  of  paragraph  two  of  this  subdivision  i, is an original plan
      discontinued member subject to  article  eleven,  he  or  she  shall  be
      credited with all of his or her "service" as a member subsequent to this
      last  restoration  to  membership and he or she shall receive therefor a
      retirement  allowance  determined  pursuant   to   the   provisions   of
      subparagraph  (i)  of  this paragraph three, except to the extent and in
      the manner that any such provision is modified by  article  eleven.  If,
      after  the  restoration  of  any  such original plan discontinued member
      subject to article eleven, he or she separates from "service" at a  time
      when  he  or  she  is  ineligible to retire under the provisions of such
      article eleven, that part of his or her accumulated contributions  which
      is attributable to the period of his or her service subsequent to his or
      her  last  restoration  to  membership  and  which remains to his or her
      credit shall be refunded to him or her, without  interest,  pursuant  to
      rules  and  regulations promulgated by the board with respect to refunds
      under such circumstances.
        (4) In addition to the applicable retirement allowance provided for by
      paragraph three of this subdivision i, any  such  new  entrant  original
      plan  discontinued  member, upon his or her subsequent retirement, shall
      receive the retirement allowance  which  he  or  she  was  receiving  or
      entitled  to  receive  immediately prior to his or her last restoration.
      If, after the restoration of any such original plan discontinued  member
      subject  to  article  eleven, he or she separates from service at a time
      when he or she is ineligible to retire  under  the  provisions  of  such
      article  eleven, he or she shall receive, in addition to the refund of a
      portion of his or her  accumulated  contributions  as  provided  for  in
      subparagraph  (ii)  of  such  paragraph  three, the retirement allowance
      which he or she was receiving or entitled to receive  immediately  prior
      to his or her last restoration.
        (5)  During  restoration  to  "service",  in lieu of suspension of any
      benefits payable in the event of his or  her  death  by  reason  of  any
      option  selection  in  respect  to  his  or  her retirement allowance, a
      beneficiary may  pay  to  the  fund  from  which  his  or  her  ordinary
      retirement  allowance  was  payable,  the  amount  by  which  his or her
      ordinary retirement allowance exceeded the optional retirement allowance
      theretofore granted to him or her, in which event such optional  benefit
      shall continue and be payable in the event of his or her death as though
      no payment were suspended.
        (6)  Any  original  plan  discontinued  member  who has again become a
      member of the pension fund pursuant to the provisions of paragraphs  one
    
      and two of this subdivision i may, during such restored membership, by a
      written  application  duly executed and filed with the board pursuant to
      the provisions of subdivision c or subdivision e of  section  13-315  of
      this  subchapter,  as  the  case  may  be,  elect  to become an improved
      benefits plan discontinued member restored  to  membership.  As  of  the
      applicable  time  specified  in  subdivision  d or subdivision f of such
      section with respect to commencement of status as an  improved  benefits
      plan  member,  any such original plan discontinued member who filed such
      an application shall cease to be an original  plan  discontinued  member
      restored  to  membership  and  shall  become  an  improved benefits plan
      discontinued member  restored  to  membership.  If  such  member  was  a
      restored original plan discontinued member not subject to article eleven
      immediately prior to the commencement of his or her status as a restored
      improved  benefits  plan discontinued member, he or she shall thereafter
      be an improved benefits plan discontinued member not subject to  article
      eleven,  restored  to membership. If such member was a restored original
      plan discontinued member subject to article eleven immediately prior  to
      the  commencement  of  his or her status as a restored improved benefits
      plan discontinued member, he or she  shall  thereafter  be  an  improved
      benefits plan discontinued member subject to article eleven, restored to
      membership. On and after the date on which the status of any such member
      as  an improved benefits plan discontinued member restored to membership
      begins, his or her rights, privileges, benefits and obligations as  such
      member  shall  be  as  prescribed by the provisions of section 13-359 of
      this subchapter; provided, however, that he or she shall  contribute  to
      the  annuity  savings  fund  on  and  after  such  date  at  the rate of
      contribution (before modification, if any, to which he  or  she  may  be
      entitled  on  account  of increased-take-home-pay) which would have been
      applicable to him or her if the  improved  benefits  plan  had  been  in
      existence and he or she had become a non-elective improved benefits plan
      member as of the date of commencement of the period of member service in
      the  uniformed force of the fire department which was credited to him or
      her at the time when he or she last discontinued service so as to become
      entitled to benefits under this section.
        j. Notwithstanding any other provision of law, a  discontinued  member
      with  ten or more years of credited service in the pension fund who dies
      before a retirement benefit becomes payable and  who  is  otherwise  not
      entitled  to  a  death  benefit from the pension fund shall be deemed to
      have died on the last day that he or she was in service upon  which  his
      or  her membership was based for purposes of eligibility for the payment
      of a death benefit pursuant to the provisions of section 13-346 of  this
      title.  The death benefit payable in such case shall be one-half of that
      which would have been payable had such member died on the last day  that
      service was rendered.

Section 13-361 ::    
        
     
        ยง  13-361 Vested retirement rights; improved benefits plan members. a.
      Any improved benefits plan member who:
        (1)  discontinues  fire  uniformed  force  service  (as   defined   in
      subdivision  sixteen-c of section 13-313 of this subchapter) on or after
      the starting date of the improved benefits plan (as such date is defined
      in subdivision twenty-seven of  such  section  13-313),  other  than  by
      death, retirement or dismissal; and
        (2)  prior  to  such  discontinuance,  completed five or more years of
      allowable fire uniformed force service; and
        (3) does not withdraw his or her accumulated deductions in whole or in
      part; and
        (4) at least thirty days prior to the  date  of  such  discontinuance,
      filed  a  duly  executed application for a deferred retirement allowance
      hereunder; shall have a vested right to receive  a  deferred  retirement
      allowance as provided in this section.
        b. (1) Upon such discontinuance under the conditions and in compliance
      with  the  provisions  of  subdivision  a of this section, such deferred
      retirement allowance shall vest automatically.
        (2) Such retirement allowance shall become  payable  on  the  earliest
      date on which such improved benefits plan discontinued member could have
      retired for service if discontinuance had not occurred.
        c.  Such  deferred  retirement  allowance,  in the case of an improved
      benefits plan discontinued member not  subject  to  article  eleven  (as
      defined  in subdivision sixteen-e of such section 13-313), shall consist
      of:
        (1) an annuity which is the actuarial equivalent of an amount equal to
      such member's accumulated deductions for the period of his or  her  fire
      uniformed  force service, plus any accumulated contributions transferred
      to his or her credit pursuant to section forty-three of  the  retirement
      and social security law, as the total of such accumulated deductions and
      contributions  is  on  the earliest date on which such member could have
      retired for service; and
        (2) a pension, which together with his or her annuity shall  be  equal
      to:
        (i) in the case of any such improved benefits plan discontinued member
      not   subject  to  article  eleven  whose  minimum  period  for  service
      retirement is twenty years, two and  one-half  percent  of  his  or  her
      annual earnable compensation on the date of his or her discontinuance of
      fire uniformed force service, multiplied by a number equal to the number
      of  years  of  allowable fire uniformed force service credited to him or
      her on the date of such discontinuance, plus the number of  his  or  her
      years  of  service  for which credit was transferred pursuant to section
      forty-three of the retirement and social security law; or
        (ii) in the case of  any  such  improved  benefits  plan  discontinued
      member  not  subject  to article eleven whose minimum period for service
      retirement is twenty-five years,  two  percent  of  his  or  her  annual
      earnable  compensation  on the date of his or her discontinuance of fire
      uniformed force service, multiplied by a number equal to the  number  of
      years  of  allowable fire uniformed force service credited to him or her
      on the date of his or her  discontinuance  of  such  service,  plus  the
      number  of  years of his or her service for which credit was transferred
      pursuant to section forty-three of the retirement  and  social  security
      law; and
        (3)  for  each year, or fraction thereof, of his or her service credit
      transferred from the New  York  city  employees'  retirement  system,  a
      pension   of   fifty-five   percent   of  one-sixtieth  of  his  or  her
      five-year-average compensation (as defined in subdivision six-a of  such
      section 13-313) if such service credit was for service rendered prior to
    
      October  first,  nineteen  hundred  fifty-one or seventy-five percent of
      one-sixtieth of  his  or  her  five-year-average  compensation  if  such
      service  was  rendered  on  or  after  October  first,  nineteen hundred
      fifty-one.
        d.  For  the  purpose  only of determining the pension portion of such
      retirement allowance pursuant to paragraphs one and two of subdivision c
      of this section, the annuity referred to in such paragraph one shall  be
      computed  as  it  would  be  (1) if it were not reduced by the actuarial
      equivalent of any outstanding loan, (2) if it were not increased by  the
      actuarial equivalent of any additional contributions, (3) if it were not
      reduced  by  reason  of  such  member's  election to decrease his or her
      annuity contributions in order to apply the amount of such reduction  in
      payment  of his or her contributions for old-age and survivors insurance
      coverage, (4) as it would be without any optional modification, and  (5)
      as  it  would be, in the case of any improved benefits plan discontinued
      member not subject to article eleven who is subject  to  a  contribution
      rate  deficiency (as defined in subdivision twenty-one of section 13-313
      of this subchapter), if  the  whole  or  any  part  of  such  deficiency
      remaining  unpaid  at  the  time  when such retirement allowance becomes
      payable had been paid to  the  pension  fund  on  his  or  her  date  of
      commencement  of  contributions  as an improved benefits plan member (as
      defined in subdivision nineteen of such section 13-313).
        d-1. Such deferred retirement allowance, in the case  of  an  improved
      benefits  plan discontinued member subject to article eleven (as defined
      in subdivision sixteen-f of such section 13-313), shall  consist  of  an
      annuity   and   pension   determined   pursuant  to  the  provisions  of
      subdivisions c and d of this section, except to the extent  and  in  the
      manner that any such provision is modified by article eleven.
        e.  Regular  interest  on  the  accumulated  deductions of an improved
      benefits   plan   discontinued   member    and    on    his    or    her
      reserve-for-increased-take-home-pay     shall    be    credited    after
      discontinuance of fire uniformed force service at the rate  which  would
      be applicable if he or she had not discontinued such service.
        f.  If  an  improved  benefits  plan  discontinued  member dies before
      attaining the earliest age at which he or she  could  have  retired  for
      service  if  discontinuance  had  not  occurred,  his or her accumulated
      deductions shall be paid (1) to the beneficiary designated by him or her
      pursuant to section 13-346 of this subchapter  to  receive  his  or  her
      accumulated  deductions in the event that such deductions were to become
      payable under such section, or (2) if  such  member  had  made  no  such
      designation, to his or her estate.
        g.  An improved benefits plan discontinued member may elect any option
      under section 13-369 of this subchapter at any time prior to  the  first
      payment  on  account  of  his  or  her  retirement  allowance under this
      section.
        h. Withdrawal of accumulated deductions, in whole or  in  part,  after
      discontinuance  of  fire  uniformed  force  service, shall terminate the
      right to a deferred retirement allowance under this section.
        i. If an improved  benefits  plan  discontinued  member  who  has  not
      withdrawn  his  or  her accumulated deductions in whole or in part shall
      subsequently re-enter fire uniformed force service before  the  earliest
      date on which such improved benefits plan discontinued member could have
      retired  for service if discontinuance had not occurred, he or she shall
      be entitled to the service credit and status to  which  he  or  she  was
      entitled  immediately  prior  to  his  or  her  discontinuance  of  fire
      uniformed force service and shall be credited with regular  interest  on
      his    or    her    accumulated    deductions    and    his    or    her
      reserve-for-increased-take-home-pay from the time of such discontinuance
    
      to the time of his or her re-entry into fire uniformed force service, at
      the rate which  would  have  been  applicable  if  he  or  she  had  not
      discontinued such service.
        j.  (1)  If  an improved benefits plan discontinued member who has not
      withdrawn his or her accumulated deductions in whole or  in  part  shall
      subsequently  and  on  or after the earliest date on which such improved
      benefits plan discontinued member could  have  retired  for  service  if
      discontinuance had not occurred, re-enters fire uniformed force service,
      the  payment of his or her pension only shall be suspended and forfeited
      during the period of such fire uniformed force service, except as herein
      otherwise provided.
        (2) Such improved benefits plan discontinued member may again become a
      member of the pension fund, if within  ninety  days  after  his  or  her
      return  to fire uniformed force service, he or she files a duly executed
      and acknowledged application for such membership.
        (3) (i) Subject to the provisions of subparagraphs (ii) and  (iii)  of
      this paragraph three, if such beneficiary shall again become a member of
      the  pension  fund,  the  payment  of  his  or her annuity shall also be
      suspended and  forfeited  and  his  or  her  annuity  reserve  shall  be
      transferred  to  his or her credit in the annuity savings fund and he or
      she shall become such member as a new entrant.
        (ii) If such improved benefits plan discontinued member, at  the  time
      of  his  or  her  discontinuance of fire uniformed force service, was an
      improved benefits  plan  discontinued  member  not  subject  to  article
      eleven, he or she shall, as such new entrant, continue to be an improved
      benefits plan discontinued member not subject to article eleven. If such
      improved  benefits  plan  discontinued member, at the time of his or her
      discontinuance of fire uniformed force service, was an improved benefits
      plan discontinued member subject to article eleven, he or she shall,  as
      such  new entrant, continue to be an improved benefits plan discontinued
      member subject to article eleven.
        (iii) Any improved benefits plan discontinued member who again becomes
      a member of the pension fund pursuant to the provisions of paragraph two
      of this subdivision j and the preceding subparagraphs of this  paragraph
      three,  shall  contribute to such fund at the rate (before modification,
      if any, to which such improved benefits plan discontinued member may  be
      entitled  pursuant  to section 13-326 of this subchapter) at which he or
      she would have been contributing if he or she had not discontinued  fire
      uniformed force service.
        (iv) Upon the subsequent retirement of any such improved benefits plan
      discontinued member who, pursuant to the provisions of subparagraph (ii)
      of  this  paragraph  three,  is  an  improved benefits plan discontinued
      member not subject to article eleven, he or she shall be  credited  with
      all  of  his  or  her  service as a member subsequent to his or her last
      restoration to membership  and  he  or  she  shall  receive  therefor  a
      retirement  allowance,  payable  in  such form as he or she shall select
      under section 13-369 of this subchapter, consisting of:
        (A) an annuity which  is  the  actuarial  equivalent  of  his  or  her
      accumulated deductions at the time of such retirement; and
        (B)  a  pension  equal  to  one-sixtieth  of his or her average annual
      earnings from the date of his or her re-entry  into  membership  to  the
      date  of  his  or her subsequent retirement, multiplied by the number of
      years of his or her allowable service in the uniformed force of the fire
      department rendered by him or her from such date of re-entry; and
        (C)  a  pension-providing-for-increased-take-home-pay  which  is   the
      actuarial equivalent of the reserve-for-increased-take-home-pay to which
      he  or  she  may  be  entitled,  if  any,  for  the period of his or her
    
      allowable service in the uniformed force of the fire department rendered
      by him or her from such date of re-entry.
        (v)  Upon the subsequent retirement of any such improved benefits plan
      discontinued member who, pursuant to the provisions of subparagraph (ii)
      of this paragraph three,  is  an  improved  benefits  plan  discontinued
      member  subject  to article eleven, he or she shall be credited with all
      of his or her service  as  a  member  subsequent  to  his  or  her  last
      restoration  to  membership  and  he  or  she  shall  receive therefor a
      retirement  allowance  determined  pursuant   to   the   provisions   of
      subparagraph  (iv)  of this paragraph three, except to the extent and in
      the manner that any such provision is modified by article eleven.
        (vi) In addition to the applicable retirement allowance  provided  for
      by  subparagraph  (iv) or subparagraph (v) of this subdivision j, as the
      case may be, any such improved benefits plan discontinued  member,  upon
      his  or her subsequent retirement, shall receive the pension which he or
      she was receiving or entitled to receive immediately prior to his or her
      last restoration.
        (vii) If, after the restoration of any  such  improved  benefits  plan
      discontinued  member subject to article eleven, he or she separates from
      service at a time when he or she  is  ineligible  to  retire  under  the
      provisions  of such article eleven, he or she shall receive a retirement
      allowance which shall consist of  an  annuity  which  is  the  actuarial
      equivalent  of  his  or  her  accumulated  deductions  and  the pension,
      including  the  pension-providing-for-increased-take-home-pay,  if  any,
      which  he  or she was receiving or entitled to receive immediately prior
      to his or her last restoration.
        (viii) In lieu of suspension  during  restoration  to  fire  uniformed
      force  service  of any benefits payable in the event of his or her death
      by reason of any optional selection in respect to his  or  her  pension,
      any  such beneficiary may pay to the fund or funds from which his or her
      ordinary pension was payable, the amount by which his  or  her  ordinary
      pension  exceeded the optional pension heretofore granted to him or her,
      in which event such optional benefit shall continue and  be  payable  in
      the event of his or her death as though no payment was suspended.
        k.  Notwithstanding  any other provision of law, a discontinued member
      with ten or more years of credited service in the pension fund who  dies
      before  a  retirement  benefit  becomes payable and who is otherwise not
      entitled to a death benefit from the pension fund  shall  be  deemed  to
      have  died  on the last day that he or she was in service upon which his
      or her membership was based for purposes of eligibility for the  payment
      of  a death benefit pursuant to the provisions of section 13-346 of this
      title. The death benefit payable in such case shall be one-half of  that
      which  would have been payable had such member died on the last day that
      service was rendered.

      would be (1) if it were not reduced by the actuarial equivalent  of  any
      outstanding  loan,  (2)  if  it  were  not  increased  by  the actuarial
      equivalent of any additional contributions, (3) if it were  not  reduced
      by  reason  of  the  member's  election  to  decrease his or her annuity
      contributions in order to apply the amount of such reduction in  payment
      of  his  or  her  contributions  for  old-age  and  survivors  insurance
      coverage, (4) as it would be without optional modification, and  (5)  as
      it  would  be,  in  the  case  of  any improved benefits plan member not

      commissioner, multiplied by the number of years of his or  her  credited
      service as fire commissioner or deputy fire commissioner.
        (3)  If  such  appointee is an original plan member subject to article

      service credit to which he or she was entitled at the time of his or her
      earlier retirement may, at his or her election, again be credited to him
      or her and upon his or her subsequent retirement as fire commissioner or

      deputy  fire commissioner was entitled at the time of his or her earlier
      retirement shall be credited as  provided  in  paragraph  five  of  this
      subdivision  b  only  in the event that he or she returns to the pension
      fund with regular interest the actuarial equivalent of the amount of the
      retirement allowance he or she received; provided, however, that in  the
      event  that  such  amount  is  not  so  repaid, the actuarial equivalent
      thereof  shall  be  deducted  from  his  or  her  subsequent  retirement
      allowance.

      as  defined  in  this  subchapter, in lieu of suspension of any benefits

      who was an original  plan  member  at  the  time  of  his  or  her  last
      retirement  prior to his or her last restoration to city-service may pay
      to the fund from which his or  her  ordinary  retirement  allowance  was

      exceeded the optional retirement allowance theretofore granted to him or
      her, in which event such optional benefit shall continue and be  payable

      purpose of providing the benefits  payable  by  reason  of  his  or  her
      selection  of Option 1 and the Option 1 retirement allowance of any such
      original plan member or pension component of  the  Option  1  retirement
      allowance  of any such improved benefits plan member shall be determined
      on the basis of gender-neutral mortality tables and regular interest  of

      the first payment on account of the retirement allowance of any original
      plan discontinued member or improved benefits plan  discontinued  member

Section 13-379.1 ::    
        
     
        ยง  13-379.1  Excess  benefit  plan.  a.  As  used in this section, the
      following words and phrases shall have the following meanings, unless  a
      different meaning is plainly required by the context:
        (1) "Retirement benefits" shall mean benefits payable to a beneficiary
      by  the pension fund or a variable supplements fund established pursuant
      to subchapter five or six of this  chapter  which  are  subject  to  the
      limitations imposed by section 415(b) of the Internal Revenue Code.
        (2)  "Beneficiary"  shall  mean  a  person who is receiving retirement
      benefits from the pension fund.
        (3)  "Excess  benefit  plan"  shall  mean  the  excess  benefit   plan
      established  by  this section for the sole purpose of paying benefits as
      permitted under section 415(m) of the Internal Revenue Code.
        (4) "Eligible participant" shall mean a beneficiary who is entitled to
      replacement benefits from the excess benefit plan for  a  plan  year  in
      accordance with subdivisions d and e of this section.
        (5)  "Replacement  benefits"  shall  mean  the benefits payable by the
      excess benefit plan to an eligible participant as determined pursuant to
      subdivision e of this section.
        (6) "Internal Revenue Code" shall mean the  Federal  Internal  Revenue
      Code of 1986, as amended.
        (7)  "Plan year" shall mean the limitation year of the pension fund as
      provided in section six hundred twenty  of  the  retirement  and  social
      security law.
        b.  There  is  hereby  established  an  excess  benefit plan, the sole
      purpose of which shall be to provide replacement benefits, as  permitted
      by  section  415(m) of the Internal Revenue Code, to beneficiaries whose
      annual retirement benefits  have  been  reduced  because  such  benefits
      exceed the limitations imposed by section 415(b) of the Internal Revenue
      Code.  The  excess  benefit  plan  shall be administered by the board of
      trustees of the pension fund.
        c. There is hereby established a  fund  to  be  known  as  the  excess
      benefit fund which shall be maintained for the sole purpose of providing
      replacement benefits to eligible participants in the excess benefit plan
      established  by  this  section, as permitted under section 415(m) of the
      Internal  Revenue  Code.  Such  fund  shall  consist  of  such  employer
      contributions as shall be made thereto pursuant to subdivision f of this
      section.  Such  contributions  to  the excess benefit fund shall be held
      separate and apart from the assets  held  by  the  other  funds  of  the
      pension  fund,  provided, however, that the assets of the excess benefit
      fund may be invested with the other pension fund assets, but such excess
      benefit fund assets shall be accounted for  separately  from  the  other
      pension fund assets.
        d. All beneficiaries of the pension fund whose retirement benefits for
      a  plan year are being reduced because of section 415(b) of the Internal
      Revenue Code shall be eligible participants in the excess  benefit  plan
      for  that  plan  year. Participation in the excess benefit plan shall be
      determined for each plan year. No beneficiary of the pension fund  shall
      be  an eligible participant in the excess benefit plan for any plan year
      for which his or her retirement benefits  are  not  reduced  because  of
      section 415(b) of the Internal Revenue Code.
        e.  (1)  For  each  plan  year  in  which a beneficiary is an eligible
      participant in the excess benefit plan, such eligible participant  shall
      receive  replacement  benefits from the excess benefit plan equal to the
      difference between the full amount of the retirement benefits  otherwise
      payable  to  the  eligible  participant  for that plan year prior to any
      reduction because of section 415(b) of the Internal  Revenue  Code,  and
      the  retirement  benefits  payable  to the eligible participant for that
      plan year as reduced because of section 415(b) of the  Internal  Revenue
    
      Code.  No  replacement benefits for any plan year shall be paid pursuant
      to this subdivision to any beneficiary who is not  receiving  retirement
      benefits from the pension fund for that plan year.
        (2) Replacement benefits pursuant to this section shall be paid at the
      same  time  and  in the same manner as the retirement benefits which are
      being replaced. At no time shall an eligible  participant  be  permitted
      directly  or  indirectly  to defer compensation under the excess benefit
      plan.
        f. (1) The required employer contributions to the excess benefit  fund
      for  each  plan  year  shall be an amount, as determined by the actuary,
      which is necessary to pay the total amount of replacement benefits  that
      are  payable  pursuant to this section to eligible participants for that
      plan year.
        (2) Such required employer contributions shall be paid into the excess
      benefit fund from an allocation of  the  employer  contribution  amounts
      paid  pursuant to section 13-331 of this subchapter and other applicable
      provisions of law. Such  allocation  of  employer  contribution  amounts
      shall  be  paid  into  the excess benefit fund at such times and in such
      amounts as determined by the actuary.
        (3) The benefit liabilities of the excess benefit plan shall be funded
      on a plan year to plan year basis, provided, however, that any  employer
      contributions  to  the  excess  benefit  fund,  including any investment
      earnings on such contributions, which are not used  to  pay  replacement
      benefits  for  the  current  plan  year shall be used to pay replacement
      benefits for future plan years.
        g. The  right  of  an  eligible  participant  to  receive  replacement
      benefits pursuant to this section, and the replacement benefits received
      pursuant  to  this  section, shall be exempt from any state or municipal
      tax, and shall not be subject to execution, garnishment,  attachment  or
      any  other  process  whatsoever,  and  shall  be unassignable, except as
      otherwise specifically provided for  benefits  payable  by  the  pension
      fund.
        h.  Nothing  contained  in  this section shall be construed to mean or
      imply that variable supplements payments  from  a  variable  supplements
      fund  established  pursuant  to  subchapter  five or six of this chapter
      constitute pension or retirement allowance payments, or  that  any  such
      variable  supplements fund constitutes a pension or retirement system or
      fund.
        i. Nothing contained in this section shall be construed  as  affecting
      in  any  way  the  eligibility  of  any  person for variable supplements
      pursuant to applicable provisions of subchapter  five  or  six  of  this
      chapter.
