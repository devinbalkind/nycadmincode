        ยง  13-304  Payment of pensions; disability; retirement for service. a.
      The board of trustees shall retire any member who, upon an  examination,
      as  provided  in  subdivision  d  of  this  section,  may be found to be
      disqualified, physically or mentally, for the performance of his or  her
      duties.  Such  member so retired shall receive from such pension fund an
      annual allowance or pension as provided in this section. In  every  case
      such  board  shall determine the circumstances thereof, and such pension
      or allowance so allowed is to be in lieu of any salary received by  such
      member  at the time of his or her being so retired. The department shall
      not be liable for the payment  of  any  claim  or  demand  for  services
      thereafter  rendered,  and the amount of such pension or allowance shall
      be determined upon the following conditions:
        1. In case of total permanent disability at  any  time  caused  in  or
      induced  by the actual performance of the duties of his or her position,
      the amount of annual pension to  be  allowed  shall  be  not  less  than
      three-fourths  of  the annual compensation allowed such member as salary
      at the date of his or her retirement and in the case of a member  acting
      in  a  higher  rank,  an  amount  not  to  exceed  three-quarters of the
      compensation of such rank on the day such injury was suffered.
        1-a. In any case where a member is allowed, pursuant to paragraph  one
      of   this   subdivision   a,  a  pension  equal  to  but  not  exceeding
      three-fourths of the annual compensation allowed such member  as  salary
      at  the  date  of  his  or her retirement, such member shall receive, in
      addition, the amount of the deductions, without interest, made from  his
      or  her  pay,  salary  or  compensation pursuant to subdivision eight of
      section 13-303 of this chapter, such amount to be paid either in a  lump
      sum  or  in  the form of an annuity which is the actuarial equivalent of
      such amount of deductions, as the member may elect. Such annuity, if  so
      elected,  shall be computed on the basis of the mortality tables adopted
      pursuant to section 13-321 of this chapter, as in effect on the date  of
      retirement of such member, and on the basis of regular interest.
        2.  In  case  of partial permanent disability at any time caused in or
      induced by the actual performance of the duties of his or her  position,
      which  disqualifies  him  or her only from performing active duty in the
      uniformed force, the  member  so  disabled  shall  be  relieved  by  the
      commissioner   from   active  service  at  fires  and  assigned  to  the
      performance of such light duties as a medical officer of such department
      may certify him or her to be qualified to perform, or he or she shall be
      retired on his or her own application at not less than three-fourths  of
      his or her salary at the date of his or her retirement from the service,
      on an examination, as provided by subdivision d of this section, showing
      that his or her disability is permanent.
        2-a.  Notwithstanding  any  other  provisions  of  this  code  to  the
      contrary, any condition of impairment of health caused  by  diseases  of
      the  lung, resulting in total or partial disability or death to a member
      of the uniformed force, who successfully passed a  physical  examination
      on  entry  into the service of such department, which examination failed
      to reveal any evidence of such condition, shall be presumptive  evidence
      that  it  was  incurred in the performance and discharge of duty, unless
      the contrary be proved by competent evidence.
        2-b. In any case where a member is allowed, pursuant to paragraph  two
      of   this   subdivision   a,  a  pension  equal  to  but  not  exceeding
      three-fourths of his or her salary at the date of his or her  retirement
      from  the service, such member shall receive, in addition, the amount of
      the deductions, without interest, made from his or her  pay,  salary  or
      compensation  pursuant  to  subdivision  eight of section 13-303 of this
      chapter, such amount to be paid either in a lump sum or in the  form  of
      an  annuity  which  is  the  actuarial  equivalent  of  such  amount  of
    
      deductions, as the member may elect. Such annuity, if so elected,  shall
      be  computed  on  the  basis of the mortality tables adopted pursuant to
      section 13-321 of this title, as in effect on the date of retirement  of
      such member, and on the basis of regular interest.
        3.  In  case of total permanent disability not caused in or induced by
      the actual performance of the duties of his or her position, which shall
      occur after the expiration of ten years' service in such department, but
      before he or she has performed service in the force for a period greater
      than the minimum period for service retirement elected by  him  or  her,
      the  amount  of  annual  pension  to be allowed shall be one-half of the
      annual compensation allowed such member  at  the  date  of  his  or  her
      retirement from the service.
        4. In case of partial permanent disability not caused in or induced by
      the  actual  performance of the duties of his or her position, which may
      occur after ten  years'  service  in  such  department,  the  member  so
      disabled  may  be  relieved  by  the commissioner from active service at
      fires, but shall remain a member of the uniformed force, subject to  the
      rules  governing  such force, and be assigned to the performance of such
      light duties as a medical officer of such department may certify him  or
      her  to be qualified to perform, or, if such member be retired after the
      expiration of ten years' service, but before he  or  she  has  performed
      service  in  the  force for a period greater than the minimum period for
      service retirement elected by him or her, the  annual  allowance  to  be
      paid to such member shall be one-half of the annual compensation allowed
      such member at the date of his or her retirement from the service.
        5.  In  case of total permanent disability not caused in or induced by
      the actual performance of the duties of his or her position,  which  may
      occur  before  the  expiration of ten years' service in such department,
      the amount of annual pension to be allowed shall  be  one-third  of  the
      annual  compensation  allowed  such  member  at  the  date of his or her
      retirement from the service.
        6. In case of partial permanent disability not caused in or induced by
      the actual performance of the duties of his or her position,  which  may
      occur  before  ten  years'  service  in  such  department, the member so
      disabled shall be relieved by the commissioner from  active  service  at
      fires,  but shall remain a member of the uniformed force, subject to the
      rules governing such force, and be assigned to the performance  of  such
      light  duties as a medical officer of such department may certify him or
      her to be qualified to perform, or, if such member be retired before the
      expiration of ten years' service, the annual allowance  to  be  paid  to
      such  member, shall be one-third of the annual compensation allowed such
      member at the date of his or her retirement from the service.
        b. Any member of such department, who has or shall have performed duty
      therein for a  period  of  twenty  years  or  upwards,  upon  a  medical

      this  subdivision  b,  an  annual  pension  equal  to  but not exceeding
      one-half of his or her full salary or compensation at the date of his or
      her retirement from the service, and if such member, at the time of such
      retirement, has performed service in the force for  a  number  of  years
      greater than the minimum period for service retirement elected by him or
    
      her,  an  annual  pension,  in  addition  to the pension provided for by
      paragraph one of this subdivision b, which shall be equal to:
        (i) one-fortieth of his or her full salary or compensation on the date
      of  his  or her retirement from the service, multiplied by the number of
      years of service in the force performed by him or her  after  completion
      of  such minimum period of service elected by him or her, if such member
      elected a minimum period of twenty years; or
        (ii) one-fiftieth of his or her full salary  or  compensation  on  the
      date of his or her retirement from the service, multiplied by the number
      of  years  of  service  in  the  force  performed  by  him  or her after
      completion of such minimum period of service elected by him or  her,  if
      such member elected a minimum period of twenty-five years.
        c. Any member who:
        1.  Shall  have elected to contribute on the basis of retirement after
      twenty years of service and who has or shall have performed  service  in
      the force for at least twenty years, or

      application in writing to and filed with the board setting forth at what
      time,  not  less than thirty days subsequent to the execution and filing
      thereof, he or she desires to be retired, shall be  retired  as  of  the
      date  specified  in  said  application  from such force and service, and
      placed on the roll of the pension fund, and awarded and granted,  to  be
      paid  from  such fund, an annual pension during his or her lifetime, not
      less than one-half his or her full salary or compensation at the date of
      his or her retirement from the service, and provided further that at the
      time so specified for his or her retirement his or her term or tenure of
      office or employment shall not have terminated or have  been  forfeited,
      provided  further  that  upon  his  or her request in writing the member
      shall be granted a leave  of  absence  from  the  date  of  filing  said
      application until the date the retirement becomes effective.
        d.  All  medical  examinations  required  by  or  made pursuant to the
      provisions of this subchapter shall be  conducted  by  a  medical  board
      appointed  by  the  commissioner,  provided,  however,  that any member,
      within thirty days after receipt of the decision of such medical  board,
      in  writing may request that the decision of such board be reviewed by a
      special medical board which shall consist of one doctor of  the  medical
      board and a doctor selected and compensated by such member. The decision
      of such special board shall supersede the decision of the medical board.
      In the event that the two doctors of the special board shall disagree, a
      recognized specialist on the condition, disease or injury for which such
      member  has  been  examined  or for which disability is claimed shall be
      selected by such doctors to be a third member of the special board.  The
      decision  of a majority of the three members of such special board shall
      supersede the decision of the medical board. The specialist selected  by
      the  two  doctors of the special board shall be compensated by the city.
      Such compensation shall be fixed by the comptroller and shall be subject
      to his or her audit.
        e. The board of trustees shall have the power to grant, award or pay a
      pension on account of physical or mental  disability  or  disease,  only
      upon  a  certificate of a medical board or a special medical board after
      examination  as  provided  in  subdivision  d  of  this  section.   Such
      certificate  shall  set  forth  the  cause,  nature  and  extent  of the
      disability, disease or injury of such member.
        f. The granting of a pension on severance from service  for  fault  or
      delinquency  shall  not  be a matter of right, but such a pension may be
      granted in consideration  of  special  circumstances  by  the  board  of
    
      trustees  and a vote of at least two-thirds of the whole number of votes
      authorized to be cast by all of the members of such board.
        g.  The  terms  "total  permanent  disability"  and "partial permanent
      disability" as used in this section may be  defined  in  the  rules  and
      regulations of the board of trustees.
        h.  Notwithstanding  any  other provision of this code, and in lieu of
      any lesser amount otherwise provided, any member of the  department  who
      has  or  shall  have  performed  duty  therein  for a period of at least
      thirty-five years may elect to be retired and placed on the roll of  the
      pension  fund,  and  awarded  and granted, to be paid from such fund, an
      annual pension during his or her lifetime, of a sum equal to his or  her
      full salary at the date of his or her retirement from service.
        i.  Except  as  otherwise  provided,  the  pensions granted under this
      section shall be for the  life  of  the  pensioner,  and  shall  not  be
      revoked, repealed or diminished.

      received, the board of trustees of such fund, upon evidence submitted to

      spouse  shall  cease  upon his or her death. Such annual allowance shall
      cease upon the death or marriage of such  child,  or  upon  his  or  her
      reaching  the  age  of  eighteen years. If such payment to the surviving
      spouse of any such member shall cease by reason of  his  or  her  death,
      such  board  shall  make payments to the child or children, or dependent
      parent or parents of such member, if any, as though he or she  had  died
      without leaving a surviving spouse.

      section, in any case where  a  pension  was  or  is  awarded  under  the

      than one-half of the salary payable to a firefighter first grade on July
      first, nineteen hundred and sixty-five, and
