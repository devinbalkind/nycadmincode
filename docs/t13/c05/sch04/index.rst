      pensions-providing-for-increased-take-home-pay) at which he or she would
      have  been  contributing on such date to the teachers' retirement system
      if he or she had become a member of such retirement system on  the  date
      when  he  or  she  last  became a member of the first retirement system;

      unpaid  any  part  of the principal or interest with respect to any loan
      made by such member while a member of the first retirement system, he or
      she shall not have the right to make such  election  unless  he  or  she
      shall  execute  and  acknowledge,  and  file with the board of the first
      retirement system, a written agreement providing that from and after the
      execution of such agreement all of his or  her  obligations  and  rights
      with respect to the principal and interest remaining unpaid on such loan
      shall be governed by rules and regulations which shall be adopted by the
      retirement  board  of the teachers' retirement system for the purpose of
      prescribing with respect to repayment of any such unpaid amounts to  the
      teachers'  retirement  system,  and  the member's status with respect to
      such loan,  terms  and  conditions  which  conform  so  far  as  may  be
      reasonable and practicable with the provisions of section 13-540 of this
      title.

      provided for in subdivision a of section 13-568  of  this  title,  by  a
      written  notice  duly  filed  with the retirement board of the teachers'

        (A)  the provisions of paragraph two of subdivision f or paragraph two
      of subdivision g of this section are amended so as to prescribe for  any
      retirement  system with respect to any fiscal year of the city a rate of
      special interest or additional interest different from  that  applicable
      to such retirement system for the next preceding fiscal year; and
    
        (B)  the  date  of  enactment  (as  such date is certified pursuant to
      section forty-one of the legislative law) of  such  amendment  is  later
      than  the  first day of the fiscal year in which such changed rate takes
      effect; and
        (C)  during  the  period beginning on such first day and ending on the
      day next preceding such date of enactment, a member of  such  retirement
      system  dies  or  the  retirement  allowance  or  vested rights deferred
      retirement allowance of such member becomes payable; the applicable rate
      of special interest or additional interest, as the case may be, for such
      next preceding fiscal year shall  apply  to  the  crediting  of  special
      interest  or additional interest in favor or such member for the portion
      of such period preceding such death or the commencement of payability of
      such retirement allowance.
        (2) (i) Nothing contained in subdivisions f  and  g  of  this  section
      shall  be  construed  as granting special or additional interest, as the
      case may be, to any person with respect to any period wherein  (A)  such
      person  was  not  a member entitled to be credited with regular interest
      for the same period in the annuity savings fund or with respect  to  his
      or her reserve-for-increased-take-home-pay or (B) was not a discontinued
      member  entitled  to  be  credited as a discontinued member with regular
      interest for the same period.
        (ii) Nothing contained in such subdivisions f and g shall be construed
      (A) as granting special interest with respect to the  total  accumulated
      contributions (as defined in subdivision seven of section 13-313 of this
      title)  of  an original plan member (as defined in subdivision four-b of
      such section 13-313) of FPF while he or she is such a member or  (B)  as

      accumulation-for-increased-take-home-pay  (as  defined  in   subdivision
      fifteen  of  such section 13-313) of an original plan member while he or
      she is such a member.

      subdivision,  in  addition  to regular interest annually allowed for the
      applicable period specified in paragraph two of this subdivision on  the
      mean  amount  for  the  preceding  year  in  each  fund  creditable with
      supplementary interest (as defined in paragraph fifteen of subdivision a
      of this section) of each retirement  system,  there  shall  be  annually
      allowed  with  respect to such period supplementary interest at the rate
      specified in such paragraph two on such mean amount  for  the  preceding
      year  in  such  fund.  Such  supplementary  interest  shall  be annually
      credited to such funds at the same  time  and  in  the  same  manner  as
      regular interest is credited to such funds with respect to such period.
        (2)  Such supplementary interest shall be allowed at the rates and for
      the periods set forth below in this paragraph:

      such last fiscal year and  if  so,  the  recommended  rate  thereof  and
      duration of such crediting; and
        (2)  as to whether legislation should be enacted providing that in the
      determination of reserves-for-increased-take-home-pay of members of such
      retirement system entitled to such a reserve, additional interest  shall
      be  included  for any period after such last fiscal year, and if so, the
      recommended rate thereof and the period as to which such interest should
      be included; and
        (3) as to whether legislation should  be  enacted  providing  for  the
      crediting of supplementary interest after such last fiscal year to funds
      creditable  with supplementary interest of such retirement system and if
      so, the recommended rate thereof and duration of such crediting.
        k. (1) (i) Subject to the provisions of subparagraphs (iii)  and  (iv)
      of  this paragraph, in any case where the valuation rate of interest for
      a retirement system is changed by law for any  period  beginning  on  or
      after July first, two thousand four, or where the board of trustees of a
      retirement  system,  for  any  period  beginning on or after July first,
      nineteen hundred ninety-nine, adopts changed actuarial  tables  used  in
      valuing   the   liabilities  of  such  retirement  system,  or  where  a
      significant change in an  actuarial  valuation  method  (as  defined  in
      paragraph  sixteen  of  subdivision  a  of this section) is made for any
      period beginning on or after July first, nineteen hundred ninety-nine in
      relation to a retirement system, the actuary thereof shall calculate, as
      of June thirtieth next preceding the first day of the  fiscal  year  for
      which  such  changed  rate or changed tables or significant change in an
      actuarial  valuation  method  first  becomes  or  became  effective,  an
      unfunded  accrued  liability  adjustment  applicable to each responsible
      obligor in relation to such retirement system, provided,  however,  that
      no unfunded accrued liability adjustment shall be established under this
      subdivision  for any retirement system with respect to any change in the
      valuation rate of interest, change in actuarial  tables  or  significant
      change  in  an  actuarial  valuation method where such changed valuation
      rate of interest, actuarial tables or actuarial valuation method applies
      to such retirement  system  with  respect  to  any  actuarial  valuation
      performed by the actuary as of June thirtieth, two thousand ten or as of
      any date thereafter.
    
        (ii)  Any  such  adjustment (or adjustments in the aggregate) shall be
      designed to amortize in installments over a period and by such method as
      shall be established by the board of trustees  or  retirement  board  of
      such  retirement  system  on  the  recommendation  of  its  actuary, and
      commencing  on such first day, the increase or decrease in the actuarial
      accrued liability of such retirement system or  pension  fund  resulting
      from  any  such  change or changes. Such period of amortization shall be
      not less than ten city fiscal years nor more than twenty such years.
        (iii) No unfunded accrued liability adjustment  shall  be  established
      under  this  subdivision  for  any retirement system with respect to any
      change in  actuarial  tables  or  significant  change  in  an  actuarial
      valuation  method,  where such changed tables or changed method apply or
      applies to such retirement system with respect to determination  of  any
      of  the NYCERS 1999 UAL, the NYCTRS 1999 UAL, the BERS 1999 UAL, the PPF
      1999 UAL (as defined in paragraph thirty-two of subdivision a of section
      13-638.3 of the code, as added by chapter six hundred eight of the  laws
      of  nineteen  hundred  ninety-one)  or  the  FPF 1999 UAL (as defined in
      paragraph thirty-two of subdivision a of section 13-683.3 of  the  code,
      as  added  by  chapter  six  hundred ten of the laws of nineteen hundred
      ninety-one), whether such change is adopted before or after July  first,
      nineteen  hundred  ninety-nine.  Nothing  contained  in this subdivision
      shall be construed as requiring the continuation after  June  thirtieth,
      nineteen hundred ninety-nine of the amortization of any unfunded accrued
      liability  adjustment  established  under this subdivision prior to such
      June thirtieth.
        (iv) No unfunded accrued liability  adjustment  shall  be  established
      under  this  subdivision  for  any retirement system with respect to any
      change in the valuation rate of interest, change in actuarial tables  or
      significant change in an actuarial valuation method if (A) such unfunded
      accrued  liabilities,  when  added  to  any  existing  unfunded  accrued
      liability, would result in the total of all unfunded accrued liabilities
      for that retirement system equaling less than zero, or if (B) the change
      in unfunded actuarial liability for that retirement system  would  cause
      an  increase  or  decrease  of  less  than  ten percent in the actuarial
      accrued liability (computed pursuant to the entry age normal cost method
      of determining such liability) and the actuary concludes  that  such  an
      unfunded accrued liability need not be established.
        (2)  Subject  to  the  provisions of the succeeding paragraphs of this
      subdivision and subdivision  1  of  this  section,  each  such  unfunded
      accrued  liability  adjustment  shall  be calculated with respect to the
      affected responsible obligor, and shall be paid by or credited  to  such
      obligor,  as the case may be, in accordance with the appropriate methods
      set forth in subdivisions b to v, inclusive, of section 13-638.1 of this
      subchapter.
        (3) (i) Each such unfunded accrued liability  adjustment  (other  than
      any  such adjustment attributable to employees of the senior colleges of
      the city university) shall  be  known  by  a  title  consisting  of  the
      numerical  designation  of  the  calendar year in which the first fiscal
      year of the applicable amortization period begins, followed by the words
      "unfunded accrued liability adjustment attributable to," followed by the
      name of the responsible obligor with respect to  which  such  adjustment
      was calculated.
        (ii)  Each  such unfunded accrued liability adjustment attributable to
      employees of such senior colleges which is calculated for  NYCERS  shall
      be  known  by  a  title  consisting  of the numerical designation of the
      calendar  year  in  which  the  first  fiscal  year  of  the  applicable
      amortization  period  begins,  followed  by  the  words "NYCERS unfunded
      accrued liability adjustment attributable to the senior colleges."
    
        (iii) Each such unfunded accrued liability adjustment attributable  to
      employees  of  such senior colleges which is calculated for NYCTRS shall
      be known by a title consisting  of  the  numerical  designation  of  the
      calendar  year  in  which  the  first  fiscal  year  of  the  applicable
      amortization  period  begins,  followed  by  the  words "NYCTRS unfunded
      accrued liability adjustment attributable to the senior colleges."
        (4) For the purpose of applying the provisions of subdivisions b to v,
      inclusive, of section 13-638.1 as prescribed by paragraph  two  of  this
      subdivision:

        k-1. All installments of  contribution  resulting  from  any  unfunded
      accrued  liability  established  for  any retirement system prior to the
      establishment of the unfunded accrued liability as  of  June  thirtieth,
      two  thousand  ten for the retirement systems pursuant to the provisions
      of paragraph one of subdivision k-2 of this section which are payable to
      any retirement system on or after July first, two  thousand  eleven  are
      hereby  canceled  and shall not be due and payable on or after such July
      first.
        k-2. (1) (i) The actuary  for  each  of  the  retirement  systems  (as
      defined  in  paragraph  one  of subdivision a of this section), upon the
      basis of the latest mortality and other tables applicable at the time he
      or she performs the calculations, and the valuation rate of interest (as
      defined in paragraph eleven of subdivision a  of  this  section),  shall
      calculate  separately  for  each  of  the retirement systems, as of June
      thirtieth, two thousand ten and as of each succeeding June thirtieth, an
      unfunded accrued  liability  for  each  of  the  retirement  systems  in
      accordance with the succeeding subparagraphs of this paragraph.
        (ii) The actuary shall calculate, as of the applicable June thirtieth,
      an  amount  equal to the sum of (A) the total actuarial present value of
      all benefits payable by the retirement  system  pursuant  to  applicable
      law,  as  determined  by  the  actuary,  and  (B)  the  liability of the
      retirement system, as determined by the actuary, for amounts  which  the
    
      retirement  system may be required by applicable law to pay to any other
      fund on account of related  benefits  financed  through  the  retirement
      system,  without  a  corresponding  offset  in  the  liabilities  of the
      retirement system.
        (iii)  The  unfunded  accrued liability of the retirement system as of
      the applicable June thirtieth shall be the amount obtained by  deducting
      from  the  amount  of  such  total liability of the retirement system on
      account  of  benefits,  as  determined  by  the  actuary   pursuant   to
      subparagraph (ii) of this paragraph, the sum of:
        (A)  the  actuarial  present  value  of entry age normal contributions
      payable to the retirement system, as determined by the actuary as of the
      applicable June thirtieth in a manner  consistent  with  the  entry  age
      actuarial  cost  method, and with the applicable methodologies set forth
      for NYCERS in subparagraph (d) of paragraph  two  of  subdivision  b  of
      section  13-127  of  this  title,  for  the  PPF  in subparagraph (e) of
      paragraph two of subdivision b of section 13-228 of this title, for  the
      FPF  in  subparagraph  (e)  of paragraph two of subdivision b of section
      13-331 of this title, for the NYCTRS in paragraph five of subdivision  b
      of  section 13-527 of this title or for BERS in item (v) of subparagraph
      four of paragraph (c) of  subdivision  sixteen  of  section  twenty-five
      hundred seventy-five of the education law;
        (B) the present value of future member contributions of all members of
      the retirement system, as determined by the actuary as of the applicable
      June thirtieth;
        (C) the total funds on hand of the retirement system, as determined by
      the actuary as of the applicable June thirtieth; and
        (D)  the  present  value  of  future  installments of unfunded accrued
      liability contributions to the retirement system.
        (iv) The  actuary,  in  determining  the  unfunded  accrued  liability
      pursuant  to  this  paragraph,  may make any adjustments which he or she
      deems appropriate  due  to  the  calculation  of  the  unfunded  accrued
      liability  as  of the second June thirtieth preceding the fiscal year in
      which the first installment of such unfunded accrued  liability  becomes
      payable or creditable.
        (2) (i) The unfunded accrued liability calculated by the actuary as of
      June  thirtieth, two thousand ten for each retirement system pursuant to
      paragraph one of this subdivision shall be known as the "2010  UAL"  or,
      with  respect to NYCERS as the "NYCERS 2010 UAL", with respect to NYCTRS
      as the "NYCTRS 2010 UAL", with respect to the PPF as the "PPF 2010 UAL",
      with respect to the FPF as the "FPF 2010 UAL" and with respect  to  BERS
      as the "BERS 2010 UAL".
        (ii)  The  2010  UAL  for each retirement system shall be amortized in
      twenty-one annual installments, as determined by  the  actuary,  payable
      over  a period of twenty-two fiscal years following its establishment as
      of June thirtieth, two thousand ten, with payments commencing  with  the
      two  thousand  eleven--two  thousand twelve fiscal year. The actuary for
      each  of  the  retirement  systems  shall  determine  the  schedule   of
      contribution installments so that each installment after the first shall
      equal one hundred three per centum of the next preceding installment.
        (3)   (i)  The  unfunded  accrued  liability  calculated  pursuant  to
      paragraph one of this subdivision by the actuary as of  June  thirtieth,
      two  thousand eleven, and as of each succeeding June thirtieth, shall be
      known as a "post-2010 UAL adjustment". With respect to  each  retirement
      system,  such  unfunded  accrued  liability  shall  be known by the name
      consisting of the applicable abbreviation for the retirement system,  as
      defined in paragraph three, four, five, six or seven of subdivision a of
      this  section,  followed  by  the calendar year as of which the unfunded
    
      accrued  liability  was  established,  followed   by   the   term   "UAL
      adjustment".
        (ii) Each post-2010 UAL adjustment for each retirement system shall be
      amortized  in equal installments payable or creditable, as determined by
      the actuary, as follows:
        (A) that portion of a post-2010 UAL adjustment which  is  attributable
      to  actuarial  gains  or  losses, as determined by the actuary, shall be
      amortized in fourteen annual installments, as determined by the actuary,
      payable or creditable over a period of fifteen  fiscal  years  following
      the  June  thirtieth  as  of  which  the  unfunded accrued liability was
      established, with payments or credits commencing with the second  fiscal
      year  succeeding  the  June  thirtieth  as of which the unfunded accrued
      liability was established, provided, however,  that  the  portion  of  a
      post-2010  UAL  adjustment  which is attributable to actuarial gains and
      losses shall be an amount equal to the total amount  of  such  post-2010
      UAL  adjustment minus an amount equal to the sum of the portions of such
      post-2010 UAL adjustment, if any, which are attributable to (1)  changes
      in  the  valuation  rate  of  interest,  changes in actuarial tables and
      changes in actuarial methods, as determined by the actuary  pursuant  to
      item  (B)  of  this  subparagraph,  and  (2) recently enacted changes in
      benefits which were not incorporated in the unfunded  accrued  liability
      established  as  of  the  preceding June thirtieth, as determined by the
      actuary pursuant to item (C) of this subparagraph;
        (B) that portion of a post-2010 UAL adjustment which  is  attributable
      to  changes  in  the  valuation  rate  of interest, changes in actuarial
      tables or changes in actuarial methods, as determined  by  the  actuary,
      shall be amortized in nineteen annual installments, as determined by the
      actuary,  payable  or  creditable  over  a period of twenty fiscal years
      following the June thirtieth as of which the unfunded accrued  liability
      was  established,  with  payments  or credits commencing with the second
      fiscal year succeeding the June  thirtieth  as  of  which  the  unfunded
      accrued liability was established; or
        (C)  that  portion of a post-2010 UAL adjustment which is attributable
      to recently enacted changes in benefits which were not  incorporated  in
      the  unfunded  accrued  liability  established  as of the preceding June
      thirtieth, as determined by the actuary, shall, unless  an  amortization
      period  of  a  different  length  is  specified by the law enacting such
      benefit changes, be payable or creditable in annual installments over  a
      period of fiscal years comparable in length to the number of years which
      is  one less than the number of years of the remaining working lifetimes
      of members covered by the benefit changes, as determined by the actuary,
      with the payment or credit of such annual installments  commencing  with
      the  second  fiscal  year  succeeding the June thirtieth as of which the
      unfunded accrued liability  was  established,  provided,  however,  that
      where  the  length of the amortization period for the benefit changes is
      not specified in the law enacting the benefit changes, the  actuary,  in
      his  or  her  discretion,  and  in lieu of amortizing the portion of the
      unfunded accrued liability attributable to the benefit  changes  over  a
      period of fiscal years comparable in length to the number of years which
      is  one less than the number of years of the remaining working lifetimes
      of members covered by the benefit changes, may  select  an  amortization
      period  that  is reasonably consistent with past practice for amortizing
      unfunded accrued  liability  attributable  to  the  particular  type  of
      benefit changes.
        (4)  Notwithstanding  any other provision of law to the contrary, with
      respect to any installment  of  an  unfunded  accrued  liability  or  an
      unfunded accrued liability adjustment, in the event that such retirement
      system  has  more  than  one  responsible  obligor, the actuary for that
    
      retirement system shall  determine  and  shall  allocate  to  each  such
      responsible  obligor  its share of that installment, as determined to be
      appropriate by the actuary. Each responsible  obligor's  share  of  each
      such  installment  shall  be either a charge or a credit with respect to
      such responsible obligor for the applicable fiscal year.
        (5) For each fiscal year, commencing with the two thousand eleven--two
      thousand twelve fiscal year, the actuary shall determine whether the sum
      of the charges and credits applicable to each  responsible  obligor  for
      such  fiscal year with respect to the applicable retirement system shall
      constitute a total charge or a total credit. Where such amount for  such
      responsible obligor for such fiscal year with respect to such retirement
      system  is  a  total charge, the responsible obligor shall pay an amount
      equal to such total charge to the retirement system in a timely  manner,
      as  required by paragraph six of this subdivision. Where such amount for
      such responsible obligor for such  fiscal  year  with  respect  to  such
      retirement   system   is   a   total  credit,  the  amount  of  employer
      contributions otherwise payable by  such  responsible  obligor  to  such
      retirement system for such fiscal year pursuant to applicable provisions
      of  law, as determined by the actuary, shall be reduced by the amount of
      such total credit, provided, however, that such total amount of employer
      contributions otherwise payable by  such  responsible  obligor  to  such
      retirement  system  for  such  fiscal year shall not be reduced below an
      amount equivalent to the amount payable by such responsible obligor  for
      such  fiscal  year  for  administrative  expenses,  as determined by the
      actuary in accordance with the provisions of subdivision  f  of  section
      13-103 of this title for NYCERS, subdivision h of section 13-216 of this
      title for the PPF, subdivision d of section 13-518 of this title for the
      NYCTRS   or   paragraph  (e)  of  subdivision  twenty-three  of  section
      twenty-five hundred seventy-five of the  education  law  for  BERS,  and
      shall  not  be  reduced  below  zero for the FPF, provided further, that
      where a total credit  for  a  responsible  obligor  with  respect  to  a
      retirement   system  has  been  offset  against  employer  contributions
      otherwise payable by such obligor to such  retirement  system  for  such
      fiscal  year by the maximum amount permissible pursuant to the preceding
      provisions of this paragraph, and  all  or  a  portion  of  such  credit
      remains  after  such  offset,  the  remaining  credit  shall  be carried
      forward, together  with  interest  calculated  on  such  amount  at  the
      valuation  rate  of  interest,  as  a  credit  for  such obligor for the
      following fiscal year, as determined by the actuary.
        (6) All responsible obligors shall make all unfunded accrued liability
      payments to a retirement system required pursuant to the  provisions  of
      this subdivision in accordance with the time of payment requirements set
      forth  in  subdivision  c  of  section  13-133 of this title for NYCERS,
      subdivision c of section 13-231 of this title for the PPF, subdivision c
      of section 13-334 of this title for the FPF, subdivision (c) of  section
      13-533  of  this  title  for  the NYCTRS or paragraph (j) of subdivision
      sixteen of section twenty-five hundred seventy-five of the education law
      for BERS.
        l. (1) In any  case  where  the  valuation  rate  of  interest  for  a
      retirement system is changed by law for any period beginning on or after
      July  first,  two thousand four, and as of June thirtieth next preceding
      the fiscal year for which such change  first  becomes  effective,  there
      remain  unpaid  or  uncredited, as the case may be, with respect to such
      retirement system, any installments of (i) the NYCERS 1999 UAL, (ii) the
      NYCTRS 1999 UAL, (iii) the BERS 1999 UAL, (iv) any post-June  thirtieth,
      nineteen  hundred  ninety-nine unfunded accrued liability adjustment (as
      defined in paragraph seventeen of subdivision a of  this  section),  (v)
      any contribution to PPF referred to in subdivision p of section 13-638.3
    
      of this subchapter (as added by chapter six hundred eight of the laws of
      nineteen  hundred  ninety-one), (vi) any contribution to FPF referred to
      in subdivision p of section 13-638.3 of this  subchapter  (as  added  by
      chapter  six  hundred ten of the laws of nineteen hundred ninety-one) or
      (vii) any other contribution by a responsible obligor  to  a  retirement
      system (other than the normal contribution) which may be required by law
      for  the purpose of funding any unfunded liability or funding deficiency
      of  such  retirement  system,  such  remaining  installments  shall   be
      recomputed  by  the actuary so that the present value of such recomputed
      installments, calculated as of such June thirtieth on the basis of  such
      changed  valuation rate, shall equal the present value of such remaining
      installments, calculated as of such June thirtieth on the basis  of  the
      valuation rate in effect immediately prior to such change.
        (2)  In  each  fiscal year succeeding such June thirtieth, one of such
      recomputed installments shall be paid by or credited to, as the case may
      be, the responsible obligor or responsible obligors with respect to such
      retirement  system  in  the  same  manner  as  the  corresponding  prior
      installments   were   paid   or   credited,  until  all  such  remaining
      installments are paid or credited in full; provided, however, that until
      all such installments are so disposed of, they shall be  recomputed  and
      paid  or  credited  in  recomputed form pursuant to this subdivision for
      each subsequent change in such valuation rate.
        m. Notwithstanding any other provision of law  to  the  contrary,  all
      NYCERS,  NYCTRS  and  BERS  installments of the revised unfunded accrued
      liability contribution, the nineteen  hundred  eighty  unfunded  accrued
      liability  adjustment,  the nineteen hundred eighty-two unfunded accrued
      liability adjustment, the nineteen hundred eighty-five unfunded  accrued
      liability  adjustment,  the nineteen hundred eighty-six unfunded accrued
      liability adjustment and  the  nineteen  hundred  eighty-eight  unfunded
      accrued  liability  adjustment  and  all  installments  of the post June
      thirtieth,  nineteen  hundred  eighty-nine  unfunded  accrued  liability
      adjustment established with respect to BERS pursuant to subdivision k of
      this   section   and   all  NYCERS,  NYCTRS  and  BERS  installments  of
      amortization of bond sale gains and losses and all  NYCERS,  NYCTRS  and
      BERS  installments  of  funding  of  supplemental retirement allowances,
      which installments, in the absence of  the  enactment  of  chapter  nine
      hundred  forty-eight  of the laws of nineteen hundred ninety and the act
      which first amended this subdivision, would otherwise be  due  from  and
      payable  by  any  responsible  obligor  to NYCERS, NYCTRS or BERS (or be
      creditable to such obligor) with respect to any fiscal  year  or  period
      beginning on or after July first, nineteen hundred ninety (including all
      such  NYCERS  or NYCTRS installments attributable to the senior colleges
      as defined  or  referred  to  in  subdivisions  seven,  eight,  eight-a,
      eight-b,  eight-c,  eight-d,  eight-e  and  eight-f of section sixty-two
      hundred two  of  the  education  law  and  subdivision  one  of  section
      sixty-two  hundred  thirty-one  of  such law) are hereby cancelled as of
      such July first and shall not be due and payable (or creditable)  on  or
      after such July first.
        n.  The  actuary of each retirement system undergoing consolidated UAL
      funding (as defined  in  paragraph  twenty  of  subdivision  a  of  this
      section)  shall  determine  the  amount  of  the  difference obtained by
      subtracting (A) the outstanding balance, as of June thirtieth,  nineteen
      hundred  ninety-five,  of  the  nineteen  hundred  ninety  balance sheet
      liability (as defined in paragraph thirty-five of subdivision a of  this
      section)  of such retirement system from (B) the outstanding balance, as
      of such June thirtieth, of the unfunded accrued  liability  as  of  June
      thirtieth,  nineteen hundred ninety (as defined in paragraph thirty-four
      of subdivision a of this section) of such retirement system.
    
        o. (1) From the  amount  of  the  difference  determined  pursuant  to
      subdivision  n  of  this  section  in relation to NYCERS, there shall be
      subtracted the portion thereof  which  is  attributable  to  the  senior
      colleges.
        (2)  The  actuary of NYCERS shall determine an amount which, when paid
      into the contingent reserve fund  of  NYCERS  in  fifteen  equal  annual
      installments,  commencing  with  payment  of  a first installment in the
      nineteen hundred ninety-five--nineteen hundred ninety-six  fiscal  year,
      shall  be  the  actuarial  equivalent,  on  the basis of nine per centum
      interest per annum, of the remainder computed pursuant to paragraph  one
      of this subdivision.
        (3)  Such  amount determined in relation to such installments shall be
      payable in regular installments as provided for  in  subdivision  bb  of
      this section.
        p.  (1)  The  actuary  of NYCERS shall determine an amount which, when
      paid by the state and the city  into  the  contingent  reserve  fund  of
      NYCERS pursuant to section sixty-two hundred thirty-one of the education
      law  in  fifteen equal annual installments, commencing with payment of a
      first installment in the nineteen hundred ninety-five--nineteen  hundred
      ninety-six  fiscal year, shall be the actuarial equivalent, on the basis
      of nine per centum interest per  annum,  of  the  amount  of  difference
      attributable  to  the  senior  colleges,  as  determined pursuant to the
      provisions of subdivision n of this section in relation to NYCERS.
        (2) Such amount determined in relation to such installments  shall  be
      payable  in  regular  installments  as provided for in subdivision bb of
      this section.
        q. (1) From the  amount  of  the  difference  determined  pursuant  to
      subdivision  n  of  this  section  in  relation to NYCTRS there shall be
      subtracted the amount  thereof  which  is  attributable  to  the  senior
      colleges.
        (2)  The  actuary  shall determine an amount which, when paid into the
      contingent reserve fund of NYCTRS in fifteen equal annual  installments,
      commencing  with  payment of a first installment in the nineteen hundred

      NYCTRS or BERS with respect to each fiscal year of  the  city  occurring
      during  the  period beginning on July first, nineteen hundred ninety and
      ending on June thirtieth, two thousand ten, the  present  value,  as  of

      set forth below in this paragraph,  provided  that  where  such  retiree

      membership  up  to  his  or  her  service retirement, including, but not
      limited to, the computation of his or her retirement allowance  and  the
      obligation  to  make  member contributions, shall be the same as if such
      person originally had become a member of the retirement system  on  such

      the  provisions  governing the purchase of pre-membership service credit
      which would be applicable to him or her if  he  or  she  originally  had
      become  a member of the retirement system on such retroactive membership
      date, subject, however, to any applicable reduction of such lump sum  in
      accordance with the provisions of paragraph nine of this subdivision. If
      such  service  retiree  does  not make such an election pursuant to such
      paragraph  five,  such  lump  sum  amount,  subject  to  any  applicable
      reduction  pursuant  to  such  paragraph  nine,  shall  be  computed  in
      accordance with the applicable  provisions  governing  the  purchase  of
      pre-membership  service  credit  on  the  basis  of  the  date  of  last

      result  in  any  benefit  or  any  increase  in benefit becoming payable

      the medical board of such retirement system.
        (ii)  Notwithstanding  any  other provision of law to the contrary, if
      such medical examination shows  that  any  such  member  who  meets  the
      requirements  of subparagraph (i) of this paragraph eleven is physically

      credit, which fraction is greater than such fraction of a calendar year.
      However, this paragraph shall not apply to teachers, including those who

      title of school crossing guard with the New York city police department,
      where  the  duties of such title are regularly scheduled to be performed

      rendered  in part-time per annum job titles for which it is difficult to
      determine the number  of  hours  actually  worked,  including,  but  not
      limited to, such titles as New York city tax commissioner, New York city
      planning  commissioner  and  New York city councilmanic aide. Such rules

      city-service rendered prior to the expiration of the window period which
      was rendered during a pay period in  which  such  member  also  rendered
      education  service for which he or she has earned or is eligible to earn
      service credit.
        (3) Notwithstanding any other provision of law to the contrary,  where

      subdivision b of this section, shall be  counted  toward  such  member's
      eligibility  for  a  retirement  benefit  as  well  as the amount of the
      benefit; provided  that  where  service  in  a  specified  title  or  in
      specified  titles  is  required  for  eligibility  for  a benefit, or is
      required with respect to the method  of  determining  the  amount  of  a
      benefit,  nothing  contained  in  this  paragraph  shall be construed as
      directing that part-time service in a title which is different from such
      specified title or titles shall be  creditable  toward  satisfying  such
    
      eligibility  requirement  or  such  requirement  as  to  the  method  of

      service by a member of NYCERS or BERS.
        (6) Nothing contained in paragraph four  or  paragraph  five  of  this
      subdivision shall be construed as adding to, diminishing or changing any

      section twenty of the BERS rules and regulations,  shall  be  deemed  to
      mean  an  amount  equal to twice the compensation paid on the payroll to
      such member for education service rendered during the period  for  which
      such  member,  while a member, was credited with his or her final twelve
      months of service credit immediately preceding his or her death.

      position  and  one  or  more  such  part-time  positions during all or a
      portion of the salary base period, then the following earnings from such
      positions for that portion of the salary base period during  which  such
      positions  were  held  concurrently  shall  be aggregated and applied in
      calculating the salary base:
        (a) the earnings from the full-time position during  such  portion  of
      such salary base period; plus
        (b)  the  earnings  from  those  part-time  positions held during such
      portion of such salary base period, which part-time positions are  equal
      in number to the part-time positions which such member held concurrently
      with a full-time position for a total of at least nine months in each of
      ten consecutive years.
        (B)  For the limited purpose only of determining, pursuant to item (A)

      part-time positions in city-service, or a member of BERS did not hold  a
      full-time position and concurrently held two or more part-time positions
      in  education  service, the portions of the earnings from such part-time
      positions during that portion of the salary  base  period  during  which
      such part-time positions were held concurrently, which earnings portions
      may  be  aggregated and applied in calculating the salary base, shall be
      determined as follows:
        (A) rank each such part-time position held  concurrently  during  such
      portion  of the salary base period in order according to the rate of pay
      which is applicable to such member for each such  position  during  such
      portion  of  the salary base period, from the highest rate of pay to the
      lowest rate of pay;
        (B) determine for each such part-time position the hypothetical amount
      of service credit which such member would have  been  eligible  to  earn
      from  such  position  for  that portion of the salary base period during
      which such two or more part-time positions  were  held  concurrently  if
      such member had held no other position concurrently with such position;
        (C)  determine  for  such  portion  of  the  salary  base  period  the
      hypothetical amount of service credit which such member would have  been
      eligible  to  earn  from  one full-time position held during a period of
      time equal in length to such portion of the salary base period;
        (D) add together all of the hypothetical  amounts  of  service  credit
      determined  for  each  position  in  accordance  with  item  (B) of this
      subparagraph;
        (E) of the hypothetical service credit sum  determined  in  accordance
      with  item  (D) of this subparagraph is less than or equal to the amount
      of hypothetical full-time service credit determined in  accordance  with
      item (C) of this subparagraph, then the earnings from all of such two or
      more  part-time  positions  from  such portion of the salary base period
      shall be aggregated and applied in calculating the salary base;
        (F) if the hypothetical service credit sum  determined  in  accordance
      with   item   (D)  of  this  subparagraph  is  greater  than  amount  of
    
      hypothetical full-time service credit determined in accordance with item
      (C) of this subparagraph, then add together the hypothetical amounts  of
      service credit determined for such positions in accordance with item (B)
      of this subparagraph in the order determined in accordance with item (A)
      of  this  subparagraph  which  are attributable to the maximum number of
      such positions which yield the  maximum  total  amount  of  hypothetical
      service credit which is less than or equal to the amount of hypothetical
      full-time  service credit determined in accordance with item (C) of this
      subparagraph;
        (G) if the hypothetical service credit sum  determined  in  accordance
      with   item  (F)  of  this  subparagraph  is  equal  to  the  amount  of
      hypothetical full-time service credit determined in accordance with item
      (C) of this subparagraph, then the total earnings from service  rendered
      during  such  portion of the salary base period from such maximum number
      of positions in such item (F)  which  yielded  such  maximum  amount  of
      hypothetical  service  credit  in  such item (F) shall be aggregated and
      applied in calculating the salary base;
        (H) if the hypothetical service credit sum  determined  in  accordance
      with  item  (F)  of  this  subparagraph  is  less  than  the  amount  of
      hypothetical full-time service credit determined in accordance with item
      (C) of this subparagraph, then  determine  the  amount  of  hypothetical
      service  credit  from  the  next  position on the list which, when added
      together  with  the  hypothetical  service  credit  sum  determined   in
      accordance   with  item  (F)  of  this  subparagraph,  shall  equal  the
      hypothetical full-time service credit determined in accordance with item
      (C) of this subparagraph;
        (I) set forth the total hypothetical  service  credit  from  the  next
      position  on the list after such maximum number of positions referred to
      in item (F) of this subparagraph;
        (J) divide the amount of hypothetical  service  credit  determined  in
      accordance  with item (H) of this subparagraph by the total hypothetical
      service credit of such next position determined in accordance with  item
      (I) of this subparagraph;
        (K)  add together all of the earnings from the service rendered during
      such portion of the salary base  period  from  such  maximum  number  of
      positions referred to in item (F) of this subparagraph;
        (L)  multiply  the  fraction determined in accordance with item (J) of
      this subparagraph by the amount of earnings from  the  service  rendered
      during such portion of the salary base period from such next position on
      the list, as referred to in item (I) of this subparagraph; and
        (M)  add  together the earnings determined in accordance with item (K)
      of this subparagraph and item (L) of this subparagraph, and the  sum  of
      such  earnings  shall  be  applied  in  calculating  the  salary base in
      accordance with the applicable  provisions  of  subdivision  e  of  this
      section.
        (ii)(A)  Where  a  member  of  NYCERS  has  held two or more part-time
      positions in city-service concurrently for a  total  of  at  least  nine
      months  in  each  of  ten  consecutive  years, and has made all required
      member contributions for such service, or a member of BERS has held  two
      or  more  part-time  positions  in  education service concurrently for a
      total of at least nine months in each of ten consecutive years, and  has
      made all required member contributions for such service, and such member
      concurrently  held  two  or  more  part-time positions during all or any
      portion of the salary base period, then the earnings from such positions
      for that portion of the salary base period during which  such  positions
      were  held  concurrently  which  shall  be  aggregated  and  applied  in
      calculating the salary base shall be the earnings from  those  part-time
      positions  held  during  such  portion of such salary base period, which
    
      part-time positions are equal in number to the part-time positions which
      such member held concurrently for a total of at  least  nine  months  in
      each of ten consecutive years.
        (B)  For the limited purpose only of determining, pursuant to item (A)
      of this subparagraph, whether such member has  held  two  or  more  such
      part-time  positions concurrently for a total of at least nine months in
      each of ten consecutive years, a full-time position held by such  member
      at  any time during such ten-year period may be deemed to be a part-time
      position.
        (7)(i) Notwithstanding any other provision of law to the contrary, for
      any period of time in which a member of NYCERS held concurrently two  or
      more  positions  in  city-service  for  which  he  or  she  made  member

      total of at least nine months in each of ten consecutive years.
        (ii)  Interest  shall  be credited on accumulated member contributions
