      performance of duty, and without fault or misconduct on the part of such
      member, has become permanently disabled, physically or mentally,  so  as

      terminate at his or her death or remarriage; or if he or she shall  have
      been  guilty  of  conduct  which  in  the  opinion of such treasurer and
      trustee renders payment inexpedient.
        3. To any child or children under eighteen years of age of such member
      so killed or dying, or dying after retirement leaving no spouse, or if a
      spouse, then after her death or remarriage or loss  of  pension  due  to
      conduct  aforesaid,  the sum of six hundred dollars per annum to be paid
      as such treasurer and trustee shall direct until such child or  children

      support, divided between them to or either one  as  such  treasurer  and
      trustee  may  direct, to cease as to the one dying upon his or her death
      or after the death of one to be continued to the other in  such  sum  as
      the  treasurer  and  trustee  may  direct,  to  cease  as to either upon
      remarriage.
        b. Notwithstanding  the  provisions  of  this  section  or  any  other
      provision  of  law,  a  person who is a spouse, minor child or dependent
      parent of any member who shall die or retire after the effective date of
      this subdivision as hereby enacted, and who, as a result of the death of
      such member or retired member, receives a pension pursuant to  paragraph

      to  paragraph  two, three or four of subdivision a of this section on or
      after the date of death of such member or retired member as a result  of
      being  a  spouse,  minor  child or dependent parent of the same deceased
      member or deceased retired member, they shall collectively be deemed  to

      subdivision  and  a  supplemental  pension  granted  to   such   persons
      collectively  under this subdivision shall be divided among such persons
      in the same proportion as the pensions received by  them  and  shall  be
      subject  to termination upon the same terms and conditions as govern the

      following conditions:
        1. He or she shall file with the secretary of such retirement system a
      duly  executed  and  acknowledged  instrument of election renouncing all
      rights in the relief and pension fund, and
        2. If the accumulated deductions of such officer or employee  in  such
      retirement  system  have been withdrawn or refunded, he or she shall pay
      into such retirement system the amount thereof,  together  with  further
      interest  thereon  at  an  unchanged rate from the time of withdrawal or
      refund, and
        3. If such officer or employee  cease  making  contributions  to  such
      retirement  system by reason of being entered on the rolls of the relief
      and pension fund as a member thereof, he or she shall pay into  the  New
      York  city  employees'  retirement  system  the  amount  of  accumulated
      deductions, computed to the time  of  payment,  which  would  have  been
      produced  during  such  period  of non-contribution by the contributions
      which would have been payable during such  period  if  such  officer  or
      employee had been then a member of such retirement system.
        b. Upon compliance by any such officer or employee with the conditions
      specified in subdivision a of this section, all rights in the relief and
      pension  fund of such officer or employee shall terminate, and he or she
      shall become a member of the New York city employees' retirement system.
      The membership of such officer or  employee  in  such  system  shall  be
      deemed to have originally begun on the date when it would have begun (as
      determined  by the commencement of the period with respect to which such
      officer or employee made contributions to  such  retirement  system)  if
      such  officer  or  employee  had  been  eligible  for membership in such
      retirement system at the time of his or her original appointment to  the
      department  of  street  cleaning;  provided  that  any  such  officer or
      employee shall be credited as a member of such  retirement  system  with
      all periods of service which would have been credited to such officer or
      employee  (including  service credit purchased) if his or her membership
      in such retirement system had actually begun on  the  date  when  it  is
      deemed to have begun as above provided. For the purpose of this section,
      the  term  "service"  shall  mean  service (1) for which such officer or
      employee was paid and (2) with respect to which  equivalent  accumulated
      deductions (i) are on deposit in such retirement system to the credit of
      such  officer  or employee at the time of the enactment of this section,
      or (ii) are paid into such retirement system by such officer or employee
      pursuant to the provisions of paragraphs two and three of subdivision  a
      of this section.
        c.  Any  sum in the relief and pension fund representing contributions
      thereto by any such officer or employee making such  election,  together
      with  interest  thereon, if such interest was theretofore paid into such
      fund by or for the account of any such officer  or  employee,  shall  be
      transferred  to the New York city employees' retirement system and shall
      be credited toward any payments required to be made by him or her  under
      the  provisions  of  paragraphs  two  and three of subdivision a of this
      section.
    
        d. No such officer or employee making such election shall acquire  any
      greater rights in such retirement system than he or she would possess if
      he  or  she had actually become a member thereof at the time when his or
      her membership is deemed to  have  commenced  under  the  provisions  of
      subdivision b of this section.
        e.  The  privilege of electing to become a member of the New York city
      employees' retirement system conferred by this section shall apply  only
      to  living  persons who qualify for the exercise of such privilege under
      this section.
