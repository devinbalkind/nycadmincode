      of  eight  and  one-quarter  per centum per annum, shall be equal to the
    
      present  value,  computed  as  of  June  thirtieth,   nineteen   hundred
      eighty-eight  at an interest rate of eight per centum per annum, of such
      original   post-June   thirtieth,    nineteen    hundred    eighty-eight
      installments.  One  of such recomputed installments, as recomputed for a
      full fiscal year, shall be applicable to and payable in each of the city
      fiscal years occurring  during  the  period  beginning  on  July  first,
      nineteen  hundred  eighty-eight  and  ending on June thirtieth, nineteen
      hundred ninety-six.
        (f) The amount of the  installment  of  such  deficiency  contribution
      payable  in  the  city's  nineteen  hundred ninety-six--nineteen hundred
      ninety-seven fiscal year shall be two-twelfths of  one  of  such  annual
      installment recomputed pursuant to item (ii) of subparagraph (e) of this
      paragraph.
        (g)  The  amount and time and manner of payment of the installments of
      the deficiency contribution  with  respect  to  the  section  thirty-one
      supplements  shall  be as prescribed in subparagraphs (b), (c), (d), (e)
      and (f)  of  this  paragraph  except  that  for  the  purposes  of  this
      subparagraph (g):
        (i)  the  term  "section thirty-one supplements" shall be deemed to be
      substituted for the term "new supplements payments  effective  September
      first,  nineteen hundred eighty-six" appearing in such subparagraphs (b)
      and (c); and
        (ii) each calendar year referred to in subparagraphs (b), (c) and  (d)
      shall be deemed to be one calendar year later; and
        (iii) item (i) of such subparagraph (e) shall not apply; and
        (iv) the word "eight" used in item (ii) of such subparagraph (e) shall
      be deemed to be nine; and
        (v)  the  words  "nineteen  hundred ninety-six" used in such item (ii)
      shall be deemed to be nineteen hundred ninety-seven; and
        (vi)  the  words  "nineteen   hundred   ninety-six--nineteen   hundred
      ninety-seven"  used  in  such  subparagraph  (f)  shall  be deemed to be
      nineteen hundred ninety-seven--nineteen hundred ninety-eight.
        f. With respect to each supplemental retirement  allowance  deficiency
      contribution  determined for a retirement system pursuant to subdivision
      e of this section, each obligor responsible for supplementation shall in
      each fiscal year constituting a part of the  applicable  payment  period
      designated  in  such  subdivision, pay to the contingent reserve fund of
      such retirement system, in the manner required with respect  to  payment
      of  its  other  public employer contributions to such contingent reserve
      fund, the installment of such contribution  applicable  to  such  fiscal
      year as prescribed by such subdivision.
        g.  In  the  computation  of  the  normal  contribution payable to the
      contingent reserve fund of any such retirement system in any fiscal year
      referred to in subdivision e of  this  section,  the  present  value  of
      future    required    supplemental   retirement   allowance   deficiency
      contributions payable to the contingent reserve fund of such  retirement
      system  by  obligors responsible for supplementation shall be an item of
      deduction from  the  total  liability  of  such  retirement  system  for
      benefits.
        h.  All  payments  required  to  be  made  in  any  fiscal year to the
      contingent reserve fund pursuant to the provisions of  this  section  by
      any  obligor responsible for supplementation shall be made with interest
      at a rate per centum per annum equal to the rate per  centum  per  annum
      used  in  determining  the normal contribution payable to the contingent
      reserve fund of such retirement system in the same fiscal year.

Section 13-696 ::    
        
     
        ยง  13-696  Cost-of-living adjustment.   a. A cost-of-living adjustment
      shall be payable to retired members of  the  New  York  city  employees'
      retirement  system,  the  New York city teachers' retirement system, the
      New York city police pension fund, the New  York  city  fire  department
      pension  fund, the New York city board of education retirement system or
      the relief and  pension  fund  of  the  department  of  street  cleaning
      provided for in subchapter one of this chapter on the basis provided for
      in  this  section  to:  (i)  all  retired  members who have attained age
      sixty-two and have been retired for five years; (ii) all retired members
      who have attained age fifty-five and have been retired  for  ten  years;
      (iii)  all members who retired for disability regardless of age who have
      been retired for five years; and (iv) all recipients  of  an  accidental
      death benefit regardless of age who have been receiving such benefit for
      five years.
        b.  Said cost-of-living adjustment shall be a percentage of the annual
      fixed retirement allowance otherwise payable, computed without  optional
      modification,  but  including  any benefit derived from subdivision f of
      this section and any prior year's cost-of-living adjustment derived from
      this section. Said percentage is set forth  in  subdivision  d  of  this
      section.
        c.  Said cost-of-living adjustment shall be computed on a base benefit
      amount not to exceed eighteen  thousand  dollars  of  the  annual  fixed
      retirement allowance defined in subdivision b of this section.
        d.  The  percentage  referred  to  in this section shall be determined
      annually by reference to the consumer price index (all urban  consumers,
      CPI-U,  U.S.  city  average,  all  items, 1982-84=100), published by the
      United States bureau of labor statistics, for each  applicable  calendar
      year. Said percentage shall equal fifty percent of the annual inflation,
      as  determined  from the increase in the consumer price index in the one
      year period ending on the March thirty-first prior to the cost-of-living
      adjustment effective on the ensuing  September  first.  Said  percentage
      shall then be rounded up to the next higher one-tenth of one percent and
      shall not exceed three percent nor be less than one percent.
        e.   Said  cost-of-living  adjustment  shall  be  payable  in  monthly
      installments  and  shall  take  effect  September  first  of  each  year
      commencing  with a payment for the month of September, two thousand one,
      or, if later, as soon as practicable  after  the  retired  member  first
      becomes   eligible   to   receive  the  benefits  provided  pursuant  to
      subdivision a of this section.
        f. Commencing September first, two thousand, all retired  members  who
      have  retired  prior  to the calendar year nineteen hundred ninety-seven
      and who meet the eligibility criteria set forth in subdivision a of this
      section shall be paid an adjusted benefit in monthly installments on the
      basis provided for in this subdivision. Said adjusted benefit  shall  be
      equal  to  a percentage of the change in consumer price index (all urban
      consumers, CPI-U, U.S. city average, all items, 1982-84=100),  published
      by  the United States bureau of labor statistics, measured from the year
      of  retirement  through  calendar  year  nineteen  hundred  ninety-seven
      according to the following schedule:
            Year of retirement                     Percentage
            1968 through 1996                      50%
            1966 and 1967                          55%
            1965                                   60%
            1964                                   65%
            1963                                   70%
            1962                                   80%
            1961                                   90%
            prior to 1961                          100%
    
      Said  adjusted benefit shall be computed on a base benefit amount not to
      exceed  eighteen  thousand  dollars  of  the  annual  fixed   retirement
      allowance otherwise payable, computed without optional modification. Any
      benefit  received  pursuant  to this subdivision shall be in lieu of any
      benefit received pursuant to chapter three hundred ninety of the laws of
      nineteen  hundred  ninety-eight,  and  any  preceding  provision  of law
      providing for supplementation.
        g. Notwithstanding any other provision of law, the surviving spouse of
      a deceased retired member of the New  York  city  employees'  retirement
      system, the New York city teachers' retirement system, the New York city
      police  pension  fund, the New York city fire department pension fund or
      the New York city board of education retirement system who retired under
      an option which provides that benefits are to be continued for  life  to
      the surviving spouse after the death of the member, shall be entitled to
      receive  a benefit pursuant to this section. Said benefit shall be fifty
      percent of the monthly benefit which the pensioner would be receiving if
      living, and  shall  commence  (i)  with  a  payment  for  the  month  of
      September,  two  thousand,  or (ii) the month following the death of the
      deceased retired member, whichever is later.
        h. Notwithstanding any law  to  the  contrary,  said  cost  of  living
      adjustment  shall  be  in  lieu of the supplemental retirement allowance
      provided pursuant to sections 13-680 and 13-691 of  this  subchapter  or
      section  two  hundred  seven-i  of the general municipal law or sections
      thirty and thirty-one of chapter six hundred fifty-eight of the laws  of
      nineteen hundred eighty-four or section ten of chapter eight of the laws
      of  nineteen  hundred  eighty-eight  as  amended by chapter five hundred
      eighty-one of the laws of nineteen hundred eighty-nine or section twelve
      of chapter  one  hundred  nineteen  of  the  laws  of  nineteen  hundred
      ninety-five  or  sections four and eight of chapter three hundred ninety
      of  the  laws  of  nineteen  hundred  ninety-eight,  unless  such  other
      supplemental  retirement allowances payable to a pensioner are in excess
      of that provided by this  section,  in  which  latter  case  such  other
      supplemental  retirement  allowances  shall  be paid and no supplemental
      retirement allowance shall be paid under this section, provided however,
      that in the case of benefits provided pursuant to  article  fourteen  of
      the  retirement  and  social security law, the cost of living adjustment
      provided herein shall be in lieu of the escalation provided  by  section
      five  hundred  ten of the retirement and social security law (other than
      the escalation provided for in subdivision e of  such  section),  unless
      such  escalation  is in excess of the cost of living adjustment provided
      for in this section, in which latter case such escalation shall be  paid
      and this section shall not apply.
        i.  Notwithstanding  any  other  provision  of law, and subject to the
      provisions of subdivisions j and k of this section,  the  cost-of-living
      adjustment  payable  by an actuarially funded retirement system pursuant
      to  this  section  shall  be  funded   by   obligors   responsible   for
      supplementation  (as  defined in subdivision b of section 13-694 of this
      article) through the normal contribution, provided,  however,  that  the
      additional  employer  costs  attributable  to  the  increase in benefits
      provided by this section shall be phased in over a period of five fiscal
      years; the actuary for each such retirement system, in  calculating  the
      normal  contribution  for  each  obligor in each of the following fiscal
      years, shall include in the calculation  of  the  final  amount  of  the
      normal  contribution  for  each  obligor the following percentage of the
      increase in the normal contribution for each such fiscal  year  that  is
      attributable  to  the increase in benefits provided by this section: (a)
      twenty percent in fiscal year two thousand--two thousand one, (b)  forty
      percent  in  fiscal  year  two thousand one--two thousand two, (c) sixty
    
      percent in fiscal year two thousand two--two thousand three, (d)  eighty
      percent in fiscal year two thousand three--two thousand four, and (e) in
      fiscal year two thousand four--two thousand five and in each fiscal year
      thereafter,  the  full amount of the increase in the normal contribution
      that is attributable to  the  increase  in  benefits  provided  by  this
      section  shall be included in the calculation of the final amount of the
      normal contribution for each such obligor.
        j. Notwithstanding the provisions of subdivision i of this section, or
      any other  provision  of  law  to  the  contrary,  and  subject  to  the
      provisions  of  subdivision k of this section, the method of funding the
      cost-of-living adjustment payable by an  actuarially  funded  retirement
      system  pursuant  to  this  section  set  forth in subdivision i of this
      section  shall  be  modified  retroactively  in  accordance   with   the
      provisions   of  this  subdivision,  commencing  with  fiscal  year  two
      thousand--two thousand one. Such cost-of-living adjustment payable by an
      actuarially  funded  retirement  system  shall  be  funded  by  obligors
      responsible  for supplementation (as defined in subdivision b of section
      13-694 of this  article)  through  the  normal  contribution,  provided,
      however,  that  the  additional  actuarial  present  value  of  benefits
      provided by this section, as determined by the actuary, shall be  phased
      in  over  a  period of ten fiscal years in accordance with the following
      percentages:
                          Fiscal Year         Percentage
                           2000-2001             10%
                           2001-2002             20%
                           2002-2003             30%
                           2003-2004             40%
                           2004-2005             50%
                           2005-2006             60%
                           2006-2007             70%
                           2007-2008             80%
                           2008-2009             90%
      In fiscal year two thousand nine--two thousand ten and  in  each  fiscal
      year  thereafter,  the  actuary  for  each  such retirement system shall
      include  in  the  calculation  of  the  final  amount  of   the   normal
      contribution  the  full  amount of the increase in the actuarial present
      value of benefits, as determined by the actuary, that is attributable to
      the increase in benefits provided by this section, provided further that
      the amount of the normal contribution that would  otherwise  be  payable
      for fiscal year two thousand two--two thousand three shall be reduced by
      an  amount  equal  to the difference between (a) the total amount of the
      increase in the normal contribution for fiscal years  two  thousand--two
      thousand   one  and  two  thousand  one--two  thousand  two,  which  was
      attributable to the increase in benefits provided by  this  section,  as
      calculated   by  the  actuary  in  accordance  with  the  provisions  of
      subdivision i of this section, and which was paid for such fiscal years,
      and (b) the total amount of the increase in the normal contribution  for
      fiscal  years  two  thousand--two thousand one and two thousand one--two
      thousand two,  which  was  attributable  to  the  increase  in  benefits
      provided  by  this  section,  as calculated by the actuary in accordance
      with the provisions of this subdivision, and which would have been  paid
      for  such  fiscal years if the act which added this subdivision had been
      in effect at the time such normal contribution was made for such  fiscal
      years.  In no event, however, shall the normal contribution be less than
      that amount necessary, as determined by the actuary, to provide for  the
      funding requirements of the group life insurance fund.
        k.  (1)  Notwithstanding  the provisions of subdivision i or j of this
      section,  or  any  other  provision  of  law  to   the   contrary,   the
    
      cost-of-living  adjustment  payable  by an actuarially funded retirement
      system pursuant to this section shall be funded in accordance  with  the
      provisions of subdivision j of this section through and including fiscal
      year two thousand four--two thousand five.
        (2)  Notwithstanding  the  provisions  of  subdivision  i or j of this
      section, or any other provision of law to the  contrary,  commencing  in
      fiscal year two thousand five--two thousand six, and in each fiscal year
      thereafter,  the  cost-of-living  adjustment  payable  by an actuarially
      funded retirement system pursuant to this section  shall  be  funded  by
      obligors responsible for supplementation (as defined in subdivision b of
      section 13-694 of this article) through the normal contribution, and the
      actuary for each such retirement system shall include in the calculation
      of the final amount of the normal contribution for each such fiscal year
      the  full  amount  of  the  increase  in  the actuarial present value of
      benefits, as determined by the actuary,  that  is  attributable  to  the
      increase in benefits provided by this section.
