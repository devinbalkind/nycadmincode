      filing of verified applications for such  payments  by  person  entitled
      thereto,  the  monthly supplemental pension to be paid to a city retired

      credited  service on which his or her retirement allowance or pension is
      based,
        (b) subtracting therefrom the amount of his or her  annual  retirement
      allowance or pension, computed without optional modification, and
        (c) dividing the result so obtained by twelve.
        2.  In  no event shall the monthly supplemental pension paid to a city
      retired employee exceed
        (a) twenty-five dollars, or thirty-three dollars and  fifty  cents  in
      any  case  where  the maximum under paragraph (b) of this subdivision is

        (b) an amount which when added to an amount equal  to  one-twelfth  of
      his  or  her  annual  retirement  allowance or pension, computed without
      optional modification, exceeds the sum of one hundred  dollars,  or  one
      hundred eight dollars and fifty cents.
        (1)  in  the  case  of  a retired employee who attained age sixty-five
      before April first, nineteen hundred fifty-six or who attains  such  age
      on  or  after  such  date,  beginning with April first, nineteen hundred
      fifty-six or with the first of the month following the date such retired
      employee attains the age of sixty-five years;

      the  first of the month following the date such retired employee attains

        3. For the purposes of this section,  in  determining  the  number  of
      years  of allowable and credited service, a major fraction or decimal of
      a year shall be counted as a full year.
        4. If any salary or time adjustment is pending then  the  supplemental
      pension  payments  to  be  received  by a city retired employee shall be
      regarded as payments on account of any increase in pension or retirement
      allowance to which such city retired employee  may  become  entitled  by
      reason  of  such  salary  or time adjustment, and may be offset from any
      increased pension payment or retired allowance which may become  payable
      to such city retired employee by reason of such adjustment.
        5. Notwithstanding any other provision of this article.
        (a)  any  person who was retired prior to July first, nineteen hundred
