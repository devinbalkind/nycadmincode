      performed duty in the department of health, for a period of twenty years
      or upwards, upon his or her own written application to  and  filed  with
      the  board of trustees, setting forth at what time, not less than thirty
      days subsequent to the execution and filing thereof, he or  she  desires
      to  be  retired,  or  upon  a  certificate  and  report  of  a  board of
      physicians, appointed by the  board  of  health,  certifying  that  such
      member  is  permanently  disabled  so as to be unfit for further duty in
      such department, or upon attaining the age of seventy  years,  shall  be
      retired  from  active service by resolution of the board of estimate, as
      of the date specified in  said  application,  or  certificate,  or  upon
      attaining  such  seventieth  year,  and  shall be placed upon the health
      department pension roll, provided that at the time so specified for  his
      or  her  retirement,  his  or her term or tenure of office or employment
      shall not have terminated or have been forfeited, and  provided  further
      that  upon  his  or her request in writing the member shall be granted a
      leave of absence from the date of filing said application until the date
      the retirement becomes effective. A member in city-service, however, who
      has or shall have attained the age of seventy years, upon  the  approval
      of  the  commissioner of health, may request the board of estimate to be
      continued in the public service for a  period  of  two  years  and  such
      board,  where advantageous to the public service, may grant such request
      for such period, not exceeding two years as such board may determine. At
      the termination of such additional period of service, such board in like
      manner may permit such employee to continue in the  public  service  for
      successive  two  year  periods  or any portion thereof. In no case shall
      public service be continued after a member shall have attained  the  age
      of  eighty  years.  Any member placed upon the health department pension
      roll under the provisions of this section shall be awarded, granted  and
      paid  from such fund by the trustees thereof an annual sum during his or
      her lifetime equal to one-half of the annual  salary  received  by  such
      member at the time of retirement plus one and one-half per centum of the
      annual  salary  received  by  him  or  her  each  year subsequent to the
      completion of his or  her  thirtieth  year  of  service,  provided  that
      paid-for  service before October first, nineteen hundred twenty shall be
      credited whether in the department  of  health  or  in  any  other  city
      department.

        c.  When  a  member has been awarded and granted a pension pursuant to
      the provisions of this section and shall die prior to receiving payments
      from such pension fund equal to the compensation earned by him or her in
      the city service while a member during  the  twelve  months  immediately
      preceding  his or her retirement, there shall be paid by the trustees of
      the pension fund to his or her estate, or to such person as  he  or  she
      has nominated or shall nominate by written designation duly executed and
      filed  with  the  board of trustees during his or her lifetime, a sum of
      money equal to the difference between the compensation earned by him  or
      her  in  the  city  service  while  a  member  during  the twelve months
      immediately preceding his or  her  retirement  and  the  total  payments
      received by him or her from such pension fund.
