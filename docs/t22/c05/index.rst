      expenditure  rate  as determined by the administering agency pursuant to
      this subdivision for such  employer's  covered  industry  by  the  total
      number  of  hours  worked during the fiscal year by all the employees of

      employees; (ii) such employer's required health care expenditure for the
      fiscal year; and (iii) whether the health care expenditure made by  such
      employer  during  the  fiscal  year is at least equal to such employer's

      administering agency, or if no such agency has been designated, with the
      city clerk, by April 1 of each year for the following fiscal year.

      maintain such records in any particular form; (ii) provide  an  employee
      or  such  employee's  designated  representative(s)  with access to such
      employee's work log and payroll  records  for  inspection  and  copying;
      (iii) maintain accurate records of health care expenditures and required
      health  care  expenditures,  and  proof  of such expenditures each year,

      maintain  such records in any particular form; and (iv) provide a report
      to  the  administering  agency  on  an  annual  basis   containing   the
      information  required to be maintained pursuant to subparagraphs (i) and
      (iii) of this paragraph, and such other information as the administering
      agency shall require. Such report shall be made available to the  public
      upon  request  without  employee  names  or other personally identifying
      information. A covered employer that is  a  signatory  to  one  or  more
      collective  bargaining  agreements  that  cover  at  least  seventy-five
      percent of its employees may comply with this  section  as  provided  in

      or indirectly intimidate, threaten,  coerce,  command  or  influence  or
      attempt to intimidate, threaten, coerce, command or influence any person
      because  such  person  has  taken an action to enforce, inquire about or
      inform others about the requirements of this section.  Taking  any  such
      adverse  action  against  any person within ninety days of such person's
      exercise of rights pursuant to this section  shall  raise  a  rebuttable
      presumption that such action was in retaliation for the exercise of such
      rights.
    
        e.  Violations  and penalties. (1) Any covered employer found to be in
      violation of this section by failing to make  health  care  expenditures

      each such violation.
        (4) In addition to being liable for civil penalties pursuant  to  this
      subdivision,  any  covered  employer found to have violated this section
      may be subject to  other  action  taken  by  the  administering  agency,
      including,  but  not  limited  to,  requesting  that  city  agencies  or
      departments revoke or suspend any city-issued registration certificates,
      permits or licenses held by such covered employer until such time as the
      violation is remedied.
        (5) Penalties imposed pursuant to this section shall  not  affect  any

        ** (2) Any proceeding to recover any civil penalty authorized pursuant
      to  this  section  shall  be  commenced  by  the  service of a notice of

      to impose the civil penalties prescribed by this section.
