      of  eligible  aggregate  employment  shares multiplied by a fraction the
      numerator of which is the lesser of the amounts determined  pursuant  to
      paragraphs  one  and  two  of  subdivision  (i) of this section for such
      premises and the denominator of which is such sum.
        (2) "Excess shares" shall mean eligible  aggregate  employment  shares

      maintained by the eligible business in the eligible area in the  taxable
      year  in  which  it  is  claiming  the credit authorized by this article
      exceeds the number of aggregate employment shares maintained  by  it  in
      the eligible area in the taxable year immediately preceding such year of
      relocation; or
        (B) for one or more relocations in a specified year of relocation that
      is  not  the latest such year of relocation by an eligible business, the
      amount, if any, by which  the  number  of  aggregate  employment  shares
      maintained  by the eligible business in the eligible area in the taxable
      year in which it is claiming  the  credit  authorized  by  this  chapter
      exceeds the sum of (I) the number of total attributed eligible aggregate
      employment  shares  that are attributed in the taxable year in which the
      credit is claimed to relocations that took place in years of  relocation
      later  than  the  specified  year  of  relocation and (II) the number of
      aggregate employment shares maintained by it in the eligible area in the
      taxable year immediately preceding such specified year of relocation.
        (ii) In the case of an eligible business that has relocated more  than
      once  in  the  same  taxable  year,  the limitation amount determined in
      accordance with subparagraph (i) of this paragraph shall be  applied  to
      such  relocations  in  the  same  proportion  as  the eligible aggregate
      employment shares apportioned to such relocations pursuant to  paragraph
      one of this subdivision.
        (3)(i)  In  any  taxable  year  in which there are excess shares, such
      excess shares, or a portion thereof, from a  relocation  or  relocations
      that took place in a specified year of relocation shall be attributed in
      reverse  chronological  order  to  any  relocations  that  took place in
      earlier years of relocation.
        (ii) Notwithstanding subparagraph (i) of this paragraph,

      number  of  eligible aggregate employment shares apportioned pursuant to
    
      paragraph one of this subdivision to such  relocation  for  the  taxable
      year  in  which the credit is claimed is less than the highest number of
      total attributed eligible aggregate employment shares pertaining to such
      relocation  in  any  taxable year prior to the taxable year in which the
      credit is claimed;
        (B) the sum of the number of  shares  attributed  to  such  relocation
      pursuant  to  subparagraph  (i)  of  this  paragraph  and  the  eligible
      aggregate employment shares apportioned to any such relocation  pursuant
      to  paragraph one of this subdivision may not exceed such highest number
      of total attributed eligible aggregate employment shares; and
        (C) such sum may not exceed the limitation amount for such  relocation
      defined in paragraph two of this subdivision.
        (4)  Notwithstanding  the  provisions  of  other  paragraphs  of  this
      subdivision,  any  excess  shares  that  are  apportioned  pursuant   to
      paragraph one of this subdivision to a relocation to particular eligible
      premises  that  are  not  located in a revitalization area as defined in
      subdivision  (n)  of  this  section,  but  are  attributed  pursuant  to
      paragraph three of this subdivision to particular eligible premises that
      are  located  in such a revitalization area, shall be treated as if such

        (1)  prior to such date such business has purchased, leased or entered
      into a contract to purchase or lease particular premises or a parcel  on
      which  will  be constructed such premises or already owned such premises
      or parcel;
        (2) prior to such  date  improvements  have  been  commenced  on  such
      premises  or  parcel  which  improvements  will meet the requirements of
      subdivision  (e)  of  section  22-621  of  this  chapter   relating   to
      expenditures for improvements;
        (3) prior to such date such business submits a preliminary application
      for  a  certification  of  eligibility  to  such mayor or such agency or
      agencies with respect  to  a  proposed  relocation  to  such  particular
      premises; and
        (4) such business relocates to such particular premises not later than
      thirty-six  months  or,  in  a  case  in which the expenditures made for
      improvements specified in paragraph  two  of  this  subdivision  are  in
      excess  of fifty million dollars within seventy-two months from the date
      of submission of such preliminary application.
        (c) The mayor or an agency or agencies designated by the  mayor  shall
      be  authorized  to  promulgate  rules  and regulations to administer and
      assure compliance with the provisions of this chapter, including but not
      limited to rules and regulations to provide for alternative  methods  to
      measure employment shares in instances where an eligible business is not
      required  by  law to maintain weekly records of full-time work weeks and
      part-time work weeks of  employees,  partners  or  sole  proprietors  as
      defined in subdivision (g) of section 22-621 of this chapter.
        (d)  An  eligible business other than a utility company subject to the
      supervision of the department of public service shall not be  authorized
      to receive a credit against the gross receipts tax imposed under chapter
    
      eleven of title eleven of the code, unless such eligible business elects
      to take the credit authorized by this section against the tax imposed by
      such  chapter  on  an  application  filed  with  respect  to  the  first
      relocation  of  such  business that qualifies or will qualify under this
      section, with the mayor or the agency designated by such mayor  pursuant
      to  subdivision  (b)  of  this  section. The election authorized by this
      subdivision  may  not  be  withdrawn  after   the   issuance   of   such
      certification of eligibility. No taxpayer that has previously received a
      certification  of  eligibility  to  receive  such credit against any tax
      imposed by chapter five or subchapter two or three  of  chapter  six  of
      title  eleven  of  the  code  may  make  the election authorized by this
      subdivision. No taxpayer  that  makes  the  election  provided  in  this
      subdivision  shall  be  authorized  to  take such credit against any tax
      imposed by chapter five or subchapter two or three  of  chapter  six  of
      title eleven of the code.
        (e)  Notwithstanding  other  provisions  of  this chapter, an eligible
      business that has obtained pursuant to subdivision (b) of this section a
      certification of eligibility for a  relocation  to  particular  eligible
      premises  may apply to the mayor of such city or an agency designated by
      such mayor to have premises in a building, other than  the  building  in
      which  such  particular  eligible  premises  are  located,  certified as
      designated additional or replacement premises as defined in  subdivision
      (q)  of section 22-621 of this chapter. After the certification provided
      for in this subdivision has  been  obtained,  any  aggregate  employment
      shares  maintained  by  the  eligible business in such premises shall be
      treated as if such employment shares were maintained in  the  particular
      premises to which the eligible business relocated. No such certification
      shall  be issued after the end of the period during which the credit may
      be taken with regard to  the  relocation  to  such  particular  eligible
      premises,  and  the issuance of such certification shall not extend such
      period. Provided,  however,  (i)  no  premises  shall  be  certified  as
      designated  additional  or replacement premises if the eligible business
      maintained employment shares in such premises prior to  the  application
      for  certification  provided  for  in this subdivision, (ii) no premises
      shall be certified as  designated  additional  or  replacement  premises
      unless  such  premises  meet  the  requirements for eligible premises in
      subdivision (e) of section 22-621 of this  chapter,  and  (iii)  if  the
      particular  premises  to  which the eligible business relocated are in a
      revitalization zone,  no  premises  shall  be  certified  as  designated
      additional or replacement premises with regard to such relocation unless
      such  designated  additional  or  replacement  premises are located in a
      revitalization zone.
        (f)(1)(i) Notwithstanding the provisions of subdivision (i) of section
      22-621 of this chapter, in the case of an eligible business meeting  the
      criteria in subparagraphs (ii) and (iii) of this paragraph, the mayor or
      his  or her designee, in his or her discretion, may for any taxable year
      in which such business is eligible to receive the credit provided for in
      this section, determine the  number  of  eligible  aggregate  employment
      shares as provided in paragraph two of this subdivision, and such number
      shall be deemed to be the number of eligible aggregate employment shares
      determined  pursuant  to  such subdivision (i) of section 22-621 for the
      purpose of attributing shares pursuant to  subdivision  (o)  of  section
      22-621  of  this chapter to relocations as defined in subdivision (j) of
      such section 22-621 occurring after July first, two thousand three:
        (ii) in the case of a relocation before July first, two thousand five,
      in the taxable year prior to its first relocation after July first,  two
      thousand three (such prior year being hereafter referred to as the "base
      year"),   such  eligible  business  maintained  more  than  one  hundred
    
      aggregate employment shares in the  eligible  Lower  Manhattan  area  as
      defined  in  subdivision  (f)  of section 22-623 of this title, provided
      that in the case of a relocation  after  June  thirtieth,  two  thousand
      five,  in the taxable year prior to its first relocation after such date
      (such prior year being hereafter referred to as the "base  year"),  such
      eligible  business maintained one or more aggregate employment shares in
      such eligible Lower Manhattan area, and
        (iii) in the case of a relocation  before  July  first,  two  thousand
      five,  in  the  taxable  year  subsequent to the base year for which the
      determination of eligible aggregate employment shares is being made, the
      number of aggregate employment shares in the  eligible  Lower  Manhattan
      area  maintained  by  the  eligible  business is less than the number of
      aggregate employment shares it maintained in such area in the base  year
      reduced  by one hundred, provided that in the case of a relocation after
      June thirtieth, two thousand five, in the taxable year subsequent to the
      base year for which the determination of eligible  aggregate  employment
      shares  is  being made, the number of aggregate employment shares in the
      eligible Lower Manhattan area maintained by  the  eligible  business  is
      less  than  the  number  of aggregate employment shares it maintained in
      such area in the base year.
        (2) The number of  eligible  aggregate  employment  shares  determined
      under   this  paragraph  shall  be  the  number  of  eligible  aggregate
      employment shares determined pursuant  to  subdivision  (i)  of  section
      22-621  of  this  chapter  without regard to paragraphs one and three of
      such  subdivision  (i),  less  the  reduction  amount  provided  for  in
      paragraph three of this subdivision.
        (3)  For any taxable year, the reduction amount shall be the excess of
      (i) the number of aggregate employment shares maintained by the eligible
      business in the eligible Lower Manhattan area in  the  base  year,  over
      (ii)  the  number  of  aggregate  employment  shares  maintained  by the
      eligible business in the eligible Lower Manhattan area  in  the  taxable
      year.
        (4)  Notwithstanding  anything  herein  to the contrary, the number of
      eligible aggregate employment  shares  may  be  determined  pursuant  to
      paragraph  two  of  this  subdivision  only if the number of such shares
      determined pursuant to such paragraph two is less  than  the  number  of
      such  shares determined pursuant to subdivision (i) of section 22-621 of
      this chapter.
        (5) The mayor, or his or her designee,  may  exercise  the  discretion
      provided  for  in  paragraph  one  of  this  subdivision  if  he  or she
      determines it to be in the best  interests  of  the  city,  taking  into
      account  whether  the  credit  provided  for  in this section caused the
      reduction in the number of jobs maintained by the eligible  business  in
      the eligible Lower Manhattan area.
