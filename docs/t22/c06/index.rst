      the  schedule  contained  in  paragraph four of this subdivision and the
      eligible public utility service charges for such energy services.
        (iii) a public utility service that sells energy services to a  vendor
      of  energy  services shall be required to make a discount to such vendor
      of energy services equal to the sum of the special rebates certified  to

      subdivision and the eligible charges for such sales of  energy  services
      made by such vendor of energy services.
        (ii)  in the case of a vendor of energy services that delivers natural

      on-site cogenerator that produces electricity  for  an  eligible  energy
      user,  shall be required to make special rebates against the energy bill
      rendered to such on-site cogenerator or  clean  on-site  cogenerator  by
      such  utility  for  the  sale  or  delivery, or both, of such gas in the
      amount or amounts derived by taking the product  of  a  base  adjustment
      multiplied  by  an  eligibility  factor,  multiplied  by  the  number of
      kilowatt hours of electricity produced by such  on-site  cogenerator  or
      clean  on-site  cogenerator and used by such eligible energy user during
      the billing period, excluding charges for natural gas used  to  generate
      electricity  used  for  heating  any  premises or by any energy user not
      located on the same site, any special charges on  such  bill,  including
      but  not  limited  to,  collection charges, late payment charges, excess
      distribution charges, and charges for energy which is resold; where  the

      cent  each January first occurring after December thirty-first, nineteen
      hundred eighty-seven, and ending on June thirtieth, two thousand  three,
      and  the  eligibility  factor shall equal one hundred percent during the
      first eight years after initial certification as an eligible energy user
      as defined in paragraphs one and  two  of  subdivision  (d)  of  section
      22-601 of this chapter, eighty percent during the ninth such year, sixty
      percent  during  the  tenth such year, forty percent during the eleventh
      such year and twenty percent during the twelfth  and  final  such  year,

      and discounts shall be reduced and/or  allocated  proportionate  to  the
      benefit  they  would  otherwise  be  eligible  for among eligible energy
      users, public utility services, vendors of energy services, and  on-site
    
      cogenerators  where  necessary to comply with this paragraph pursuant to

      shall  be  eligible  for  special rebates for a period not to exceed one
      hundred forty-four months calculated from the  beginning  of  the  month
      immediately  following  their  date  of  certification  of  eligibility.
      Eligible  energy  users  meeting  the  criteria  of  paragraph  two   of
      subdivision  (d) of section 22-601 of this chapter shall be eligible for
      special rebates for a period calculated from the beginning of the  month
      immediately  following  their  date of certification for so long as they
      remain in occupancy in the specially eligible premises, but  not  beyond
      the  period  of  one hundred forty-four months from the beginning of the
      month immediately following the  date  of  certification  of  the  first
      eligible  energy  user  occupying  such specially eligible premises. The
      amounts of rebates made to such an  eligible  energy  user  meeting  the
      criteria  of  such  paragraph two shall be determined in accordance with
      the schedule contained in paragraph four  of  subdivision  (a)  of  this
      section  as  if such eligible energy user had been certified at the same
      time as such first eligible  energy  user  was  certified.  A  qualified
      eligible  energy user that takes occupancy of targeted eligible premises
      shall be eligible for special rebates for a period calculated  from  the
      beginning  of  the month immediately following its date of certification
      as a qualified eligible energy  user  for  so  long  as  it  remains  in
      occupancy  in  the targeted eligible premises, but not beyond the period
      of one hundred  forty-four  months  from  the  beginning  of  the  month
      immediately  following  the date of certification of the first qualified
      eligible energy user occupying  such  targeted  eligible  premises.  The
      amounts  of  rebates made to a qualified eligible energy user that takes
      occupancy  of  targeted  eligible  premises  shall  be   determined   in
      accordance  with the schedule contained in paragraph four of subdivision
      (a) of this section as if such qualified eligible energy user  had  been
      certified  at the same time as such first qualified eligible energy user
      was certified. An on-site cogenerator or clean on-site cogenerator shall
      be eligible for special rebates for a period not to  exceed  the  period
      during which the eligible energy user served by such on-site cogenerator
      or  clean  on-site  cogenerator  would  have been eligible for a special
      rebate under the provisions of this subdivision had it purchased  energy
      services directly from a utility.
        (c)  (1)  No  eligible  energy  user,  qualified eligible energy user,
      on-site cogenerator,  clean  on-site  cogenerator  or  special  eligible
      energy user shall receive a rebate pursuant to this chapter until it has
      obtained  a certification as an eligible energy user, qualified eligible
      energy user, on-site cogenerator, clean on-site cogenerator  or  special
      eligible  energy  user,  respectively,  from  the  commissioner of small
      business services. No such certification for a qualified eligible energy
      user shall be issued on or after July first, two thousand three. No such
      certification of any other eligible energy user, on-site cogenerator  or
      clean  on-site  cogenerator  shall be issued on or after July first, two
      thousand thirteen. The commissioner of small  business  services,  after
      notice  and  hearing, may revoke a certification issued pursuant to this
      subdivision where it is found that eligibility criteria  have  not  been
      met or that compliance with conditions for continued eligibility has not
    
      been  maintained. The corporation counsel may maintain a civil action to
      recover an amount equal to any benefits improperly obtained.
        (2)  A  utility  and a vendor of energy services shall keep records of
      all transactions subject to this article and make such records available
      to the department of small business services.
        (d) (1) Utilities subject to the provisions of subdivision (a) of this
      section shall reduce each bill for energy services or  natural  gas  for
      each   eligible   energy   user,  vendor  of  energy  services,  on-site
      cogenerator or clean on-site cogenerator as follows:
        (i) a bill for the sale and delivery of natural  gas  rendered  to  an
      on-site  cogenerator  or clean on-site cogenerator entitled to a special
      rebate pursuant to the provisions of paragraph five of  subdivision  (a)
      of  this  section  shall  be  reduced  by the full amount of the special
      rebate that shall have accrued for the period covered by each such bill;
        (ii) a bill for energy services rendered to any other eligible  energy
      user  or  on-site cogenerator shall be reduced by the full amount of the
      special rebate that shall have accrued for the period  covered  by  each
      such bill.
        (iii)  a  bill  for  energy  services  rendered  to a vendor of energy
      services that has provided a special rebate to an eligible  energy  user
      or  on-site  cogenerator  shall be reduced by such utility in accordance
      with paragraph three of subdivision (a) of this section by the aggregate
      amount of all such special rebates;
        (iv) provided, however, such utility shall not be required to  provide
      a  special  rebate  or  discount in an amount that exceeds the amount of
      such bill for the sale and  delivery  of  natural  gas  rendered  to  an
      on-site  cogenerator  or clean on-site cogenerator entitled to a special
      rebate pursuant to the provisions of paragraph five of  subdivision  (a)
      of  this  section  or,  in the case of any other eligible energy user or
      on-site cogenerator, the amount of such bill for  energy  services,  and
      provided,  further,  that  no  utility  subject  to  the  provisions  of
      subdivision (a) of this section shall be required to  carry  forward  on
      its  books  and  records  any  special  rebate  or discounts not made in
      accordance with this sentence to such bills for subsequent periods. Such
      discount shall be made within four months from the time certification of
      special rebates is made in accordance with subparagraph (iii) or (iv) of
      paragraph one of subdivision (a) of this section. Such amount  shall  be
      separately stated and shown on each bill.
        (2)  A  public  utility  service  that  provides  special  rebates for
      eligible energy users or qualified eligible energy  users  shall  reduce
      each  bill  rendered to each such user by the full amount of the special
      rebate that shall have accrued for the period covered by each such  bill
      in  accordance  with  paragraph  two of subdivision (a) of this section.
      Such amounts shall be separately stated and shown on such bills.
        (3) Each such vendor of energy services that has  elected  to  provide
      special  rebates  for  eligible  energy users, qualified eligible energy
      users or on-site cogenerators shall reduce each bill  rendered  to  each
      such energy user or cogenerator by the full amount of the special rebate
      that  shall  have  accrued  for  the period covered by each such bill in
      accordance with paragraph three of subdivision (a) of this section. Such
      amounts shall be separately stated and shown on such bills.
        (e) The commissioner of small business services shall, for the purpose
      of calculating eligible charges, eligible public utility service charges
      and eligible on-site cogenerator charges, promulgate rules to  determine
      that portion of such charges that shall be deemed attributable to energy
      services  or natural gas used for heating the premises. He or she shall,
      in addition, promulgate any other rules  and  regulations  necessary  to
      effectuate  the  purposes  of this chapter, including rules to determine
    
      the extent to  which  charges  are  eligible  charges,  eligible  public
      utility  service  charges  or  eligible  on-site cogenerator charges and
      rules to  provide  for  such  administrative  charges  or  fees  as  are
      necessary  to  defray  expenses in administering the special rebates and
      discounts provided pursuant to this chapter.
