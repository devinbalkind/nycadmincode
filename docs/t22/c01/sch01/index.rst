Section 22-104 ::    
        
     
        §  22-104 Lands under water not within the projected boundary lines of
      streets; patenting of.
        a. Patents of land under water within the city shall be made  only  to
      the city or to the riparian proprietor. Where, pursuant to section seven
      hundred five of the charter or section 22-132 of this chapter, a plan or
      plans  for  the construction of docks between street intersections shall
      be projected, the commissioner of ports and trade, with the approval  of
      the  board  of estimate, may make application to the commissioner of the
      state department of general services for a grant of  lands  under  water
      for that purpose. Such state commissioner thereupon shall give notice to
      the  riparian  proprietor  before  taking action in the matter and shall
      then make such grant to the city for the purposes specified  in  section
      22-103  of this subchapter. Such grant, however, shall be subject to all
      the rights of  the  riparian  proprietor,  and  before  the  city  shall
      construct  such  public wharves or other structures in front of the land
      of such riparian proprietor, the city shall make  just  compensation  to
      such proprietor for the value of all the riparian rights.
        b.  Where  application  is  made  to  the  commissioner  of  the state
      department of general services by the riparian proprietor for a grant of
      soil or lands under water within the city, such state commissioner shall
      give notice thereof to the commissioner of ports  and  trade  who  shall
      examine  into  such  application  and certify to such state commissioner
      whether in his or her opinion the granting of  the  same  will  conflict
      with  the  rights  of  the  city or be otherwise injurious to the public
      interests of the city. Such grant, if made, shall be confined  to  lands
      under  water  in  front  of  such  riparian  proprietor  and  such state
      commissioner may insert such terms and conditions in the  grant  as  are
      recommended  by  the commissioner of ports and trade and as will protect
      the public interests of the city in respect to navigation and  commerce.
      The validity of any such grant or patent may be judicially determined in
      an action brought by and in the name of the city.
    
    
    
    
    
    
    

Section 22-105
--------------

Section 22-105 ::    
        
     
        §  22-105  Wharf property; proceedings to acquire. a. The commissioner
      may agree with the owners of any wharf property, or uplands upon a price
      for the same and shall certify such agreement to the mayor. If the mayor
      approve such agreement, the commissioner shall take from the  owners  at
      such  price,  the  necessary  conveyances and covenants for vesting such
      wharf property or uplands in, and assuring the same to the city  of  New
      York  forever,  and such owner shall be paid such price by the city. If,
      however, the commissioner shall determine that the city  should  acquire
      such wharf property or uplands by condemnation, without first attempting
      to agree with the owners thereof for its purchase, the commissioner may,
      with  the  approval  of the mayor direct the corporation counsel to take
      legal proceedings to acquire the  same  for  the  city.  Thereupon,  the
      corporation  counsel  shall  take  the  same proceedings to acquire such
      wharf property or uplands as are provided  for  the  taking  of  private
      property in the city for public streets or places, and the provisions of
      subchapter  one  of  chapter  three of title five of the code are hereby
      made applicable, as far as may be necessary,  in  any  legal  proceeding
      taken   under   this  section.  Before  any  such  proceeding  shall  be
      instituted, a statement shall be furnished to the mayor of the valuation
      of the real  property  to  be  acquired  as  assessed  for  purposes  of
      taxation.  The  title  to  such property shall vest in the city upon the
      date of the filing of the survey or map showing the real property to  be
      acquired   subdivided  into  parcels  corresponding  with  the  separate
      ownerships thereof in the office of the clerk of the county  where  such
      proceeding  is pending; and all of the rights, title and interest of any
      and all of the owners or persons interested in such  wharf  property  or
      uplands, shall cease and determine and be extinguished at such time. All
      the  awards  made in such proceedings for the value of property acquired
      or interests extinguished shall draw  interest  from  the  time  of  the
      vesting of the title in the city.
        b.  The  commissioner, with the approval of the board of estimate, may
      agree, license and permit private owners of any wharf property, to  make
      the  necessary improvements upon their property, so as to conform to the
      water front plan during the period which shall intervene  prior  to  the
      extinguishment  of such private ownership by the city. Such improvements
      shall be made by  such  owners  under  the  supervision  of  or  by  the
      commissioner,  as  may  be  agreed upon, at the cost and expense of such
      private owners, in the first instance, and upon such reasonable terms as
      to reimburse such private  owners  for  such  improvements,  and  as  to
      wharfage  and  other  riparian  rights  thereon and therefrom, as may be
      agreed upon.

      mayor, prior to  approving  or  authorizing  the  acquisition  of  wharf
      property  or  uplands, or directing the vesting in the city of any title
      thereto, may hold a public hearing and shall  refer  any  such  proposed
      acquisition  to  the  appropriate  agency  pursuant to the provisions of
      chapter eight of the charter. Public notice of any hearing held  by  the
      mayor shall be given by publication for six consecutive days in the City
      Record,  not  less  than  seven,  nor  more than thirty days before such
      public hearing. Such publication  shall  contain  in  addition  to  such
      information  as  the  commissioner may deem proper, a description of the
      property to be affected  by  the  order  to  acquire  such  property,  a
      statement  by  the  mayor  of  the  date,  time and place of such public
      hearing, and an abstract of the recommendation of  the  commissioner  in

      high  water in front of the property of such upland owner upon such line
      or lines as the commissioner shall deem best adapted to the  improvement
      of the water front.
        b.  Such  agreement  may  provide  for  the sale and conveyance to the
      upland owner of lands under water inside  of  such  line,  and  for  the
      purchase  from  such  upland owner of lands outside of such line, or for
      the exchange of lands under water inside of such line for lands  outside
      of  such  line.  Such agreement for sale and conveyance, together with a
      map showing the lines so fixed, determined upon and established shall be
      transmitted  to  the  department  of  city  planning  pursuant  to   the
      provisions  of  sections  one  hundred  ninety-seven-c  and  one hundred
      ninety-nine of the charter. If such agreement involves the  purchase  or
      acquisition  of  such  lands, the agreement, together with a map showing
      the lines so fixed, determined upon and established shall be transmitted
      to the mayor. Upon approval by the board of estimate of  such  agreement
      for sale and conveyance and upon approval of such agreement for purchase
      or  acquisition  by the board of estimate and by the mayor such sale and
      conveyance shall be made upon such terms and  conditions  as  the  board
      shall deem proper, and such purchase or exchange shall be made upon such
      terms and conditions as the board and the mayor shall deem proper.

      property,  wharf,  pier,  dock  or  bulkhead,  and  shall use it for the
      purpose of regularly receiving  and  discharging  cargo  such  owner  or
      lessee,  with the consent of the lessor, may erect and maintain thereon,
      sheds for the protection of property so received or discharged, provided
      they shall have obtained from the commissioner, license or authority  to
      erect  or  maintain the same, subject to the conditions and restrictions
      contained in such license or authority. Such license or authority, after
      it has been granted and has been acted upon, shall  not  be  revoked  by

      board of estimate. Notice shall be  given  to  all  parties  having  any
      interest  therein  of a hearing before the board of estimate to consider
      the application of the commissioner for the revocation of  such  license
      or  authority. Such notice shall be given by publication thereof for six
      consecutive days in the City Record, not less than  ten  nor  more  than
      thirty  days  before such hearing, and by posting, not less than ten nor

      commissioner  may  build  and  maintain  such  sheds  on any water front
      property, wharf, pier, dock or bulkhead owned by the city and under  the

      proper  doors and gates appertaining thereto. The commissioner may grant
      a permit or license, however, upon such terms and conditions  as  he  or
      she  may  deem  proper to the lessee of piers twelve, thirteen, fifteen,
      and sixteen owned by the city  in  the  borough  of  Staten  Island,  to
      maintain  a  place  for  the  keeping and care of goods, merchandise and
      materials discharged from vessels, upon any floor of any such pier.

      condition of any premises or structure located on or along the banks  or

      specify.  It  shall  be the duty of an owner upon whom such an order has
      been served to remove, repair, reconstruct, alter or abate  such  public
      nuisance in the manner and in the time provided by such order.
        c. 1. An order of the commissioner issued pursuant to subdivision b of

      reasonable time for compliance but not less than thirty  days  from  the
      date of service of such order. Such order shall contain a statement that
      upon  the  failure  of the owner to comply with the commissioner's order
      within the stated time, the department may perform the work specified in
      the order or apply for a court order directing the owner to comply  with
      the commissioner's order or directing the department to perform the work
      specified  in  the  commissioner's  order.  Such  statement  shall  also
      indicate that if the department performs any of the  work  specified  in
      the  commissioner's  order,  the  expense  incurred by the department in
      performing such work shall be a debt recoverable from the  owner  and  a
      lien on the premises with respect to which such order was issued.
        2. Service of such order shall be made upon the owner personally or by
      certified  mail addressed to the last known address of such person or in
      any manner provided for service of process by article three of the civil
    
      practice law and rules. The commisssioner may serve a copy of such order

        3. A copy of such order shall be filed with the office of the register
      in the county in which the premises with respect to which such order was
      issued are situated.
        4.  Within thirty days after service of such order upon an owner, such
      owner or a mortgagee or lienor upon whom a copy of such order  has  been
      served  may  request  a  hearing.  At  such hearing such person shall be
      entitled to be represented by  counsel  and  to  present  evidence.  The
      commissioner may affirm, modify or revoke the order.
        d.  If  the owner fails to comply with the commissioner's order within

      section,  if  an  owner  fails  to  comply with the commissioner's order
      within the time fixed for compliance pursuant to subdivision c  of  this
      section,   the   commissioner  may  apply  to  any  court  of  competent
      jurisdiction, upon such notice and in such manner  as  the  court  shall
      direct,   for   an   order  directing  the  owner  to  comply  with  the
      commissioner's order or directing the department  to  perform  the  work
      specified in the commissioner's order.
        f. The procedures set forth in subdivisions c, d and e shall not apply
      to the abatement of a nuisance with respect to any structure not affixed
      to  real  property,  including  but  not limited to any derelict vessel,
      ship, barge, raft or floating craft of any kind. The commissioner  shall
      provide  for the abatement of a nuisance with respect to such structures
      pursuant to the procedures set forth  in  sections  22-109,  22-110  and
      22-111 of this subchapter.
        g. 1. The expense of the department with respect to any work performed
      by  or  on  behalf of the department pursuant to subdivisions d and e of
      this section shall be a debt recoverable from the owner and a lien  upon
      the premises with respect to which such work was performed.
        2.  The  department shall keep a record of all work performed by or on
      behalf of the department. Such records shall be accessible to the public
      during business hours. Within  thirty  days  after  the  issuance  of  a
      purchase or work order for such work, such order shall be entered on the
      records  of  the  department.  Such entry shall constitute notice to all
      parties.
        3. All such expenses shall constitute a lien upon  the  premises  when
      the amount thereof shall have been definitely computed as a statement of
      account  by the department and the department shall cause to be filed in
      the office of the city collector an entry of the account stated  in  the
      book  in which such charges against the premises are to be entered. Such
      lien shall have a priority over all other liens and encumbrances on  the
      premises  except for the lien of taxes and assessments. However, no lien
      created pursuant to this section shall be enforced against a  subsequent
      purchaser  in  good  faith  or  mortgagee  in  good  faith  unless  such
      transaction occurred after the date of entry of a purchase or work order
      on the records of the department  pursuant  to  paragraph  two  of  this
      subdivision.
        4.  A  notice  thereof  stating  the  amount due and the nature of the
      charge shall be mailed by the city collector within five days after such
      entry to the last known address of the person whose name appears on  the
      records  in the office of the city collector as being the owner or agent
      or as the person designated by the owner to receive tax bills or,  where
      no  name  appears, to the premises, addressed to either the owner or the
      agent. Such notice shall have stamped or printed thereon a reference  to
      this section.
    
        5.  If  such  charge  is  not paid within thirty days from the date of
      entry, it shall be the duty of the city collector  to  receive  interest
      thereon  at  the  rate  of  interest  applicable  to such property for a
      delinquent tax on real property to be calculated to the date of  payment
      from the date of entry.
        6.  Such  charge  and the interest thereon shall continue to be, until
      paid, a lien on the premises. Such charge and interest may be  collected
      and the lien thereof may be foreclosed in the manner provided by law for
      the  collection  and foreclosure of taxes, sewer rents, sewer surcharges
      and water charges due and payable to the  city  and  the  provisions  of
      chapter four of title eleven of the code shall apply to such charges and
      the interest thereon and the lien thereof.
        7.  (1)  In  any  proceedings  to  enforce  or discharge the lien, the
      validity of the lien shall not be subject to challenge based on (i)  the
      lawfulness  of  the work done; or (ii) the propriety and accuracy of the
      items of expenses for which a lien is claimed,  except  as  provided  in
      this paragraph.
        (2)  No  such  challenge  may  be  made except by (a) the owner of the
      property, or (b) a mortgagee or lienor whose mortgage or lien would  but
      for  the  provisions of this section have priority over the department's
      lien.
        (3) An issue specified in subparagraph one which was decided or  could
      have  been contested in a prior court proceeding to secure a court order
      pursuant to  subdivision  e  of  this  section  shall  not  be  open  to
      re-examination,  but if any mortgagee or lienor of record was not served
      with  an  order  of  the  commissioner  pursuant  to  paragraph  two  of
      subdivision c and with notice of such proceeding, his or her mortgage or
      lien  shall  have the same priority over the lien of the department that
      it would have had but for the provisions of this section.
        8. In addition to establishing a lien, the department may recover such
      expenses and interest by bringing  an  action  against  the  owner.  The
      institution  of such action shall not suspend or bar the right to pursue
      any other remedy provided by law for the recovery of such debt.

      formerly  under  water  but  now filled in and having streets physically
      laid out thereover or adjacent thereto, heretofore granted by the mayor,
      aldermen and commonalty of the city of New York, or by the city  of  New
      York,  by  a  grant  containing  covenants  or  conditions requiring the
      maintenance of such streets, and otherwise, may file with the  secretary
      of  the  board  of estimate an application in writing for a release from
      such covenants and conditions setting forth a description of such lands,
      the ownership thereof, the number of feet fronting on the street and the
      width of such street together with a statement enumerating all  of  such
      convenants and conditions relating to such lands. Such application shall
      contain  a statement that all covenants and conditions contained in such
      grant have been complied with  except  the  covenant  or  condition  for
      future  maintenance  of such street. Such secretary, upon payment by the
      applicant of a fee of fifty dollars to cover the  expenses  incident  to
      investigating the truth of the statements contained in such application,
      shall  make  due inquiry and, if such statements are in fact true, shall
      present to such board a report and certificate as to the authenticity of
      the facts set forth in such application. Such board may thereafter adopt
      a resolution approving of the report of such secretary. If  such  report
      is  approved by such board, such owner may obtain from the comptroller a
      release of all covenants and conditions contained in such grant  insofar
      as  such  convenants  and  conditions affect the lands of the applicant,
      upon payment to the commissioner of finance of a  sum  equal  to  twenty
      dollars  per front foot of such property based on a street sixty feet in
      width, or of a proportional sum based on streets  having  a  greater  or
      less  width,  and  upon receipt of such sum, such comptroller for and on
      behalf of the city, shall issue to such owner a  certificate  evidencing
      such  release,  the  same  to be in form for recording. Such certificate
      shall be approved as to form by  the  corporation  counsel  and  may  be
      recorded  in  the same manner and in the same recording office as a deed
      of real property. After such release, with respect to any  parcel,  such
      city  shall  keep  in  repair  or cause to be kept in repair the roadway
      portion of such street on which the parcel abuts.
        b. In the event that any such convenants  or  conditions,  other  than
      those  requiring  the maintenance of streets, have not been performed in
      whole or in  part,  a  special  application  for  a  release  from  such
      covenants  or  conditions,  on  a  form to be prescribed by the board of
      estimate, may be made by such owner  to  such  board.  Such  application
      shall  set  forth  a description of such land by metes and bounds, or by
      street and number, the dimensions of such land, a statement  enumerating
      all  the  covenants  and  conditions  relating to such land, or, in lieu
      thereof, a copy  of  the  grant  of  such  land,  or  other  instrument,
      containing  all  such  covenants  and  conditions and a statement of the
      particular covenants or conditions, specifying  them,  for  the  release
      from  which  the application is made, and such other information as such
      board may deem necessary or appropriate. Such board, upon payment  of  a
      fee of fifty dollars, shall cause an investigation to be made concerning
      the  statement  contained  in  such  application. If satisfied from such
      investigation that the interests of the  city  will  not  be  prejudiced
      thereby,  such  board,  by  resolution  may authorize the comptroller to
      issue to such owner a release from such covenants and conditions  for  a
      sum of money to be agreed upon by and between such board and such owner.
      Upon  receipt  of such sum, such comptroller shall, for and on behalf of
      the city, issue to such owner a  certificate  evidencing  such  release.
      Such certificate shall be approved as to form by the corporation counsel
      and  may be recorded in the office of the commissioner of transportation
    
      and in the same manner and in the same recording office  as  a  deed  of
