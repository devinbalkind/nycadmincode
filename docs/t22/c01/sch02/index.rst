      the  city,  shall  prepare  plans  for  terminal facilities, which shall
      consist of:
        1. A map or maps showing the area to be  included  in  such  terminal,

      property  required  for  such  terminal facilities, shall be laid out or
      constructed by the city, its agents or contractors.
        c. Whenever such plans shall include the narrowing or  widening  of  a
      street  or  the  opening  and  construction  of  a  new  street  or  the

      required  to  be replotted, regraded or otherwise adapted for convenient
      access to and use of such ways or stations or other improvement  of  the
      water front of the city in connection therewith.
        d.  Such parts of the lands acquired by the city under and pursuant to
      the provisions of this subchapter which in the judgment of the board  of
      estimate  are  no longer required for the improvement of the water front
      facilities of the city or for any other public purpose, except the  part
      of  such lands so acquired as have been heretofore assigned by the board
      of estimate to the use of the department of ports and trade, may be sold
      by the city in the manner prescribed by subdivision b of  section  three
      hundred  eighty-four  of the charter. The proceeds of such sale shall be

Section 22-139
--------------

Section 22-139 ::    
        
     
        §  22-139  Private  operation.  a.  If  the  board  of  estimate shall
      determine  that  municipal  operation  of  any  terminal  facilities  is
      inexpedient,  it  shall  advertise  for  proposals  for the privilege of
      constructing, equipping and operating the same,  or  for  equipping  and
      operating  after  construction  by  the  city,  or  for  operating after
      construction and equipment by the city, by a notice to be printed once a
      week for two successive weeks in not less than two daily newspapers, and
      may require security from bidders for the execution of  their  bids,  if
      accepted.  Such  notice  shall describe such terminal facilities in such
      terms as the board of estimate shall deem proper, and  shall  state  the
      time  and  place  at  which  proposals  will be received and opened. All
      proposals shall undertake to equip  such  facilities,  unless  equipment
      shall  have  been provided by the city, and to maintain and operate such
      terminal facilities for a period not exceeding twenty-five  years,  with
      the  privilege,  however, of renewing such contract for a further period
      not exceeding twenty-five years upon terms to be readjusted as  provided
      in  such  contract.  Such proposals may offer to pay to the city for the
      use of such terminal facilities either (1) a fixed annual sum; or (2)  a
      share  of  gross  receipts; or (3) a share of net receipts. The board of
      estimate, or a duly appointed committee thereof,  shall  attend  at  the
      time  and place specified in such public notice, and shall publicly open
      all proposals which shall have been received, but such board  shall  not
      be  bound  to  accept any proposals so received, and may reject all such
      proposals and readvertise  for  proposals  in  the  manner  hereinbefore
      provided,  or  may accept any of such proposals as will, in the judgment
      of such board, best promote the public interest, and  award  a  contract
      accordingly.
        b.  Any  contract  for  private operation of terminal facilities shall
      contain a provision whereby the city, at any time after ten  years,  may
      terminate the same so far as it relates to the maintenance and operation
      of terminal ways, and terminal stations, and the equipment thereof, upon
      terms  to  be  fixed  in  such  contract, upon giving one year's written
      notice of its intention so to do. Upon termination by the city, pursuant
      to the privilege so reserved, the  city  shall  purchase  the  equipment
      actually  used in the operation of such terminal facilities at an amount
      agreed upon between the owner thereof and the city; or, in the event  of
      failure  to  agree, at an amount to be fixed by appraisal, each party to
      name an impartial appraiser, and the two so named to select  the  third.
      In the event of failure to agree upon a third appraiser, he or she shall
      be  named  by  the  presiding  justice  of the appellate division of the
      supreme court, first department; provided, however,  that  the  contract
      for  the  operation  of  such  terminal  facilities  may provide for the
      amortization of all or a  part  of  the  operator's  investment  out  of
      earnings,  in  which  event  the  portion  so amortized shall become the
      property of the city at the termination of the contract without  further
      payment to the operator.
        c. Any contract for private operation may provide for the construction
      of  warehouses,  factories or other buildings on land owned by the city,
      which warehouses, factories or buildings shall, during construction  and
      at  all  times thereafter, be the property of the city. The contract may
      provide for the amortization of the cost of such  warehouses,  factories
      or  buildings  out  of receipts from their operation, or out of receipts
      from the operation of all  the  terminal  facilities  included  in  such
      contract during the term thereof, and may provide for the payment by the
      city  of  any  unamortized  portion of the actual cost plus a reasonable
      contractor's profit, not to exceed fifteen per centum at the termination
      of the contract, or on the exercise of an option to  recapture  reserved
      in  the  contract.  The contract may provide for the payment to the city
    
      for the privilege of operating  such  warehouses,  factories,  or  other
      buildings  so constructed, either (1) a fixed annual sum; or (2) a share
      of the gross receipts; or (3) a share in the net profits.
        d. Such contract may contain any other provision not inconsistent with
      this section which the board of estimate may deem necessary or desirable
      for the protection of the interests of the city.
        e.  Notwithstanding  the  provisions  of any general or special law, a
      railroad corporation may, with the consent of  the  board  of  estimate,
      purchase,  acquire or hold any stocks or any bonds or other evidences of
      indebtedness of a corporation which, pursuant to  this  section,  enters
      into  a  contract with the city for the operation of terminal facilities
      in the boroughs of Brooklyn and Queens, or either  of  them,  and  which
      contract  provides  for  the handling over such terminal road of freight
      moved by water, or partly by rail and partly by water, and freight moved
      wholly by rail, without discrimination as between such freight moved  by
      water,  or  partly by rail and partly by water, and freight moved wholly
      by rail. The consent of such board  shall  be  granted  only  upon  such
      notice  and  after  such  hearing  as  may be prescribed under rules and
      regulations which such board is hereby authorized to adopt.

        §  22-140  Construction  clause.  Nothing contained in this subchapter
      shall be construed  as  in  any  way  limiting  the  present  or  future
      jurisdiction  of the public service commission of the state of New York,
      and nothing contained in this subchapter shall be construed as  limiting
      or  repealing  any of the provisions of the railroad law of the state of
      New York.   Provided, however, that it shall  not  be  necessary  before
      constructing  a  railroad  as  part  of  terminal facilities to obtain a
      certificate  of  convenience  and  necessity  from  the  public  service
      commission.
