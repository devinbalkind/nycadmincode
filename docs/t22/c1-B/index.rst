        ยง  22-252  Photo identification card required. a. It shall be unlawful
      for any person to be an employee or a principal working in  a  wholesale
      business  or market business in a market unless such person has obtained
      a photo identification card issued by the commissioner pursuant  to  the
      provisions  of  this  chapter  or  for a person to work on an occasional
      basis in a market unless such person has obtained a day pass  issued  by
      the commissioner. The commissioner shall set forth by rule the number of
      occasions   within   a  specified  time  period  that  shall  constitute
      occasional work to meet unanticipated needs of businesses in the  market
      and  shall  make  reasonable  provision  to  delegate  authority for the
      issuance of day passes on a twenty-four hour basis to persons  hired  to
      work  by  wholesalers  and  market  businesses on an occasional basis. A
      photo identification card shall be in the possession of an  employee  or
      principal  at  all  times when such person is in the market and shall be
      produced  upon  demand  by  an  authorized  employee  or  agent  of  the
      department,  the  department  of investigation or the police department.
      The commissioner shall make provision for temporary photo identification
      cards to be issued pending the processing of applications for  permanent
      photo  identification  cards  and  for  the  expedited issuance of photo
      identification cards to family members of principals of a wholesaler  or
      market  business  and  others  who work on a seasonal basis. A temporary
      identification card shall cease to be valid, and shall  be  returned  to
      the  department,  upon  the refusal to issue a photo identification card
      pursuant to subdivision d of this section or denial of  registration  to
      the  business  in which the person applying for such identification card
      is a principal or is employed.
        b. A photo identification card shall identify the  business  of  which
      the  individual  is  a  principal  or by which he or she is employed and
      shall be non-transferrable. Upon a change in employment within a market,
      an individual shall inform the department and the department shall issue
      a photo identification card reflecting such changed employment.
        c. An application for a photo identification card shall  be  submitted
      on  a  form  prescribed  by  the  commissioner  and  shall  contain such
      information  as  the  commissioner  shall  determine  is  necessary   to
      establish  the  identity  and  background  of  the  applicant.  A person
      required by this chapter to possess a photo  identification  card  shall
      inform  the  commissioner  of  any  subsequent  material  change  in the
      information provided on such application, including but not  limited  to
      arrests and/or criminal convictions.
        d.  Notwithstanding  any  other  provision  of this section, where the
      commissioner has reasonable cause to believe that  an  applicant  for  a
      photo  identification  card lacks good character, honesty and integrity,
      the commissioner may require that such applicant  be  fingerprinted  and
      provide  to  the commissioner the information set forth in subdivision a
      of section 22-259 of this  chapter.  The  commissioner  may  thereafter,
      after  notice  and  opportunity  to  be  heard,  refuse to issue a photo
      identification card for the reasons set forth in subdivision b  of  such
      section.
        e. If at any time subsequent to the issuance of a photo identification
      card,  the  commissioner has reasonable cause to believe that the holder
      thereof does not possess good  character,  honesty  and  integrity,  the
      commissioner  may require such person to be fingerprinted and to provide
      the background information required by subdivision a of  section  22-259
      of  this  chapter  and  may,  after  notice and opportunity to be heard,
      revoke such photo identification card  for  the  reasons  set  forth  in
      subdivision b of such section.

Section 22-253 ::    
        
     
        ยง  22-253 Registration required for wholesalers and market businesses.
      a. No person shall conduct a wholesale business or a market business  in
      a  public  wholesale  market  unless  such  person  has  registered such
      business with the commissioner and has obtained  a  registration  number
      for   such   business   from  the  commissioner.  Application  for  such
      registration shall be made upon a form prescribed  by  the  commissioner
      containing   such   information  as  the  commissioner  shall  determine
      appropriately identifies and demonstrates the fitness of  the  wholesale
      business  or  market  business.  A  registration  number  shall  not  be
      transferable. A person conducting  a  wholesale  business  or  a  market
      business  shall  not sublease or assign to another person any portion of
      any premises in the market occupied or utilized by such business  unless
      such  proposed  sublessee or assignee has registered with and obtained a
      registration  number  from  the  commissioner.  The  commissioner  shall
      establish by rule a procedure for the preliminary review of registration
      applications  for  businesses  not previously operating in a market that
      are considering the  purchase  of  a  wholesale  business  or  a  market
      business,  and  for the expedited completion of registration review upon
      entry into a  purchase  and  sale  agreement.  A  business  required  to
      register  pursuant  to this section shall inform the commissioner of any
      change in the ownership composition  of  the  business,  the  arrest  or
      criminal  conviction  of  any  principal  of  the business, or any other
      material change in the information  submitted  on  the  application  for
      registration within thirty calendar days thereof.
        b. (i) Notwithstanding any provision of this chapter, the commissioner
      may,  when  there  is reasonable cause to believe that any or all of the
      principals of an applicant  for  registration  lack(s)  good  character,
      honesty  and  integrity, require that such principal(s) be fingerprinted
      and provide to the commissioner the information set forth in subdivision
      a of section 22-259 of this chapter,  and  may,  after  notice  and  the
      opportunity  to  be  heard,  refuse  to  register such applicant for the
      reasons set forth in subdivision b of such section.
        (ii) If at any time subsequent to  the  registration  of  a  wholesale
      business  or  market  business, the commissioner has reasonable cause to
      believe that any or all of the principals of such wholesale business  or
      market  business  do  not possess good character, honesty and integrity,
      the commissioner may require that such principal(s) be fingerprinted and
      provide the background information required by subdivision a of  section
      22-259  of  this chapter and may, after notice and the opportunity to be
      heard, revoke the registration of  such  wholesale  business  or  market
      business for the reasons set forth in subdivision b of such section.
        (iii)  At any time subsequent to the conduct of an investigation of an
      applicant for registration or a registrant pursuant to paragraph (i)  or
      paragraph   (ii)   of   this   subdivision  that  has  produced  adverse
      information, the commissioner may require as a condition of issuance  or
      the  continuance of a registration that the wholesale business or market
      business enter into a contract with an independent auditor  approved  or
      selected  by the commissioner. Such contract, the cost of which shall be
      paid by the registrant, shall provide that the auditor  investigate  the
      activities  of the wholesale business or market business with respect to
      compliance  with  the  provisions  of  this  chapter,  other  applicable
      federal, state and local laws and such other matters as the commissioner
      shall  determine.  The  contract  shall provide further that the auditor
      report the findings of such monitoring and investigation in a manner  to
      be  prescribed  by  the  commissioner  to the commissioner on a periodic
      basis.
        (iv) A  wholesale  business  or  market  business  shall  provide  the
      commissioner  with  notice of at least ten business days of the proposed
    
      addition of a new principal to  such  business  and  shall  provide  the
      commissioner with such information concerning such proposed principal as
      is  set  forth  in the rules promulgated by the commissioner pursuant to
      section  22-266  of  this chapter. The commissioner may waive or shorten
      such period upon a showing  that  there  exists  a  bona  fide  business
      requirement  therefor.  Except  where the commissioner determines within
      such period, based on information available to  him  or  her,  that  the
      addition  of  such  new  principal  may  have  a  result inimical to the
      purposes of this chapter, such wholesaler or  market  business  may  add
      such new principal pending the completion of review by the commissioner.
      Such  wholesale  business  or  market  business  shall  be  afforded  an
      opportunity to demonstrate to the commissioner that the addition of such
      new principal pending completion of such review would not have a  result
      inimical   to   the  purposes  of  this  chapter.  If  the  commissioner
      determines, following completion of such  review,  that  such  principal
      lacks  good  character,  honesty  and  integrity, the registration shall
      cease to be valid if the commissioner determines that such principal has
      failed to divest his or her interest,  or  to  discontinue  his  or  her
      involvement  in  the  business of such business or both, as the case may
      be, within the time period prescribed by the commissioner.
        c. The department shall maintain and publish a list of all wholesalers
      and market businesses that are registered with the commissioner together
      with the registration numbers of such wholesalers and market businesses.
      The department shall make such list available  to  suppliers,  shippers,
      truckers  and  any  member of the public who requests it and shall, upon
      request, verify to suppliers, shippers and truckers whether  a  business
      is currently registered with the commissioner.

Section 22-254 ::    
        
     
        ยง  22-254  Conduct  of wholesale businesses and market businesses. The
      commissioner shall establish by rule measures governing the  conduct  of
      wholesale  businesses  and  market  businesses  in  the public wholesale
      markets, including but not limited to: (i) requirements  that  wholesale
      businesses  maintain and supply their registration numbers to suppliers,
      and shippers and truckers; (ii) requirements for the disposal  of  waste
      and  other  sanitary  measures;  (iii) appropriate insurance and bonding
      requirements; (iv) provisions requiring  the  maintenance  of  financial
      statements,  records,  ledgers,  receipts,  bills and such other written
      records as the commissioner  determines  are  necessary  or  useful  for
      carrying  out  the  purposes  of  this  chapter.  Such  records shall be
      maintained for a  period  of  time  not  to  exceed  five  years  to  be
      determined  by  rule  by  the commissioner, provided, however, that such
      rule may provide that the commissioner may, in specific instances at his
      or her discretion, require that records be maintained for  a  period  of
      time exceeding such five years. Such records shall be made available for
      inspection  and  audit  at the request of the commissioner at either the
      registrant's place of business or at the offices of the department;  and
      (v)  such  other  rules  as  he or she deems necessary or appropriate to
      effectuate the provisions of this chapter.

Section 22-255 ::    
        
     
        ยง  22-255 Visitor pass. The department or a designee of the department
      shall be authorized to issue a visitor pass as  a  requirement  for  any
      person  to enter a public wholesale market including but not limited to:
      retailers who enter the market to purchase products and their  employees
      and  temporary  employees;  and,  subject  to  the provisions of section
      22-264 of this chapter, officers and business agents of labor unions  or
      organizations  covered  by such section and officers and business agents
      of the affiliates thereof, including international unions,  pension  and
      welfare funds and others. Such pass shall be in a form prescribed by the
      commissioner, may contain a photograph of such person and shall indicate
      the reason the person is visiting the market, whether such person visits
      the market on a regular basis or, in the event that such person does not
      regularly visit the market, the date for which such pass shall be valid.
      The  commissioner  may  provide  for  the  issuance of permanent visitor
      passes to those persons who regularly visit a market, and shall  provide
      for the expeditious issuance of passes at the market entrance to persons
      wishing  to  enter  the  market  on a single or occasional basis. A pass
      shall be in possession of such person at all times when such  person  is
      in  the  market  and  shall be worn and visible in compliance with rules
      promulgated by the commissioner  pursuant  to  section  22-266  of  this
      chapter.  The  department  or,  at  the  direction  of the department, a
      designee of the department, shall be authorized to deny a  visitor  pass
      and  entry  into  a market to any person whose presence may constitute a
      threat to the orderly operation of a market or who has failed to provide
      the identifying information required by the commissioner or the designee
      of the commissioner. The provisions of this section shall not  apply  to
      any  public wholesale market to which access by the public has routinely
      been permitted without control, restriction or other regulation  for  no
      less  than  a  year  directly  preceding  the  effective  date  of  this
      provision; provided, however,  that  the  commissioner  may  apply  such
      provisions   upon   a   determination  that  an  emergency  exists  that
      necessitates the temporary restriction of access to such a  market.  For
      the  purposes of this section, a "designee of the department" shall mean
      an agency of the city or, in  the  discretion  of  the  commissioner,  a
      wholesaler  cooperative or similar organization. Nothing in this section
      shall be construed  to  permit  the  denial  of  a  visitor  pass  to  a
      representative  of  a  labor  union or labor organization solely because
      such person seeks to engage in  the  lawful  exercise  within  a  public
      wholesale  market  of  an activity protected under the provisions of the
      National Labor Relations Act, 29 U.S.C. ยง 141 et  seq.,  including,  but
      not  limited  to,  the  lawful  picketing  of  a  place of business of a
      wholesale business or market business in connection  with  a  legitimate
      labor  dispute,  except  as may otherwise be prohibited by law. However,
      such person shall not impede any  reasonable  measure  undertaken  by  a
      police  officer  or  authorized  employee  of the department intended to
      control vehicle and pedestrian  traffic  within  such  public  wholesale
      market  or  upon  any  street,  avenue,  parkway, plaza, square or other
      public place designated as  a  public  market.  The  commissioner  shall

        b. The commissioner may, after notice and the opportunity to be heard,
      refuse to register an applicant or issue a photo identification card  to
      a  person  who  lacks good character, honesty and integrity. Such notice

      connection with the application; (ii) a pending indictment  or  criminal

      subdivision would provide a basis for the refusal of such  registration,
      or  a  pending civil or administrative action to which such applicant or
      person is a party and which directly relates to the fitness  to  conduct
      the  business  or  perform  the work for which the registration or photo

      to,  an  offense  listed  in subdivision one of section nineteen hundred
      sixty-one of the Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations  statute
      (18 U.S.C. ยง 1961 et seq) or for an offense listed in subdivision one of
      section  460.10  of  the penal law, as such statutes may be amended from
      time to time, or the equivalent offense under  the  laws  of  any  other
      jurisdiction;  (v)  association  with  any  member  or  associate  of an
      organized crime group as identified by a  federal,  state  or  city  law
      enforcement  or investigative agency when the applicant for registration
      or photo identification card knew or should have known of the  organized
      crime associations of such person; (vi) a principal of the applicant was
      a principal in a predecessor wholesale business or market business where
      the  commissioner  would  be  authorized  to  deny  registration to such
      predecessor business pursuant to this subdivision; or (vii) in the  case
      of  an  applicant business, failure to pay any tax, fine, penalty or fee
      related to  the  applicant's  business  for  which  liability  has  been
      admitted  by  the person liable therefor, or for which judgment has been
      entered by a court or administrative tribunal of competent  jurisdiction
      and  such  judgment  has not been stayed. An applicant may submit to the
      commissioner any material or explanation which such  applicant  believes
      demonstrates  that  information  submitted  pursuant to this subdivision
      does not reflect adversely upon the applicant's good character,  honesty
      and integrity.
    
        c.  The  commissioner  may  require  that  an applicant business shall
      submit  such  information  as  the  commissioner  deems   necessary   to
      demonstrate  the  financial  responsibility of such applicant to conduct
      the activity for which such registration is required, and may refuse  to
      register any applicant who has not, in the commissioner's determination,
      demonstrated such financial responsibility.
        d.  The  commissioner  may  refuse  to  register  or  to issue a photo
      identification card to a person when such applicant has knowingly failed
      to  provide  the  information  and/or  documentation  required  by   the
      commissioner  pursuant to this chapter or any rules promulgated pursuant
      thereto or who has otherwise failed to demonstrate eligibility for  such
      registration  or  photo  identification  card  under this chapter or any
      rules promulgated pursuant thereto.
        e. The commissioner may  refuse  to  register  or  to  issue  a  photo
      identification  card to a person when such applicant: (i) was previously
      issued a registration or a photo identification card under this  chapter
      and such registration or card was revoked or not renewed pursuant to the
      provisions  of this chapter or any rules promulgated hereto; or (ii) has
      been determined to have committed any of the acts which would be a basis
      for  the  suspension  or  revocation  of   registration   or   a   photo
      identification  card  pursuant  to this chapter or any rules promulgated
      hereto.
        f. For the purposes of this section: "predecessor  wholesale  business
      or  market  business" shall mean a wholesale business or market business
      in which one or more principals of the applicant were principals in  the
      five  year  period  preceding  the  application;  and,  in  relation  to
      investigations of employees pursuant to section 22-252 of this  chapter,
      the  term "applicant" shall be deemed to apply to employees or agents of
      an applicant for registration.

      cause  to  believe that the operation of any business or the presence of
      any person in a public wholesale market creates an  imminent  danger  to
      life  or  property or to the orderly and lawful operation of the market,
      or that there has likely been false or fraudulent information  submitted
      in  an  application made pursuant to this chapter, immediately suspend a

      hearing,  provided  that provision shall be made for an immediate appeal
      of such suspension to a deputy commissioner of the department who  shall

      business  whose registration has been suspended, permit such business to
      remain in the market for such time as is  necessary  to  allow  for  the
      expeditious  sale, consignment or removal of a perishable product if, in

      be imposed for such violation and the costs of removal and storage.
        c.  Where  a  court  of  competent  jurisdiction  or the environmental
      control board makes a finding that the  vehicle  or  other  property  or
      equipment  has  not  been  used in connection with an act constituting a
      violation of subdivision a  of  section  22-253  of  this  chapter,  the
      vehicle  or  other  property or equipment shall be released forthwith to
      the owner or any person authorized by the owner to  take  possession  of
      such vehicle, property or equipment.
        d.  Any  vehicle  or  other  property  or  equipment that has not been
      claimed by the owner within ten business days  after  mailing  by  first
      class  mail  to  such  owner  of notice of a determination by a court of
      competent jurisdiction or by the environmental control board that  there
      has been no violation or that the vehicle or other property or equipment
      was  not used in connection with a violation of subdivision a of section
      22-253 of  this  chapter  shall  be  deemed  by  the  department  to  be
      abandoned.   Any   vehicle   unclaimed  under  the  provisions  of  this
      subdivision shall be disposed of by the department pursuant  to  section
      twelve  hundred  twenty-four of the vehicle and traffic law. Property or
      equipment other than a vehicle shall be disposed of by  sale  at  public
      auction  following  notice  by publication in the city record describing
      such property or equipment not less than ten business days prior to such
    
      sale. Such notice shall provide that the owner may reclaim such property
      or equipment until a date that shall be not  sooner  than  ten  business
      days from the date the notice is published.
        e.  (i)  in  addition  to  any  other  fines,  penalties, sanctions or
      remedies provided for in this chapter, a vehicle or  other  property  or
      equipment  which  has  been  seized  pursuant  to  subdivision a of this
      section and all rights, title and interest therein shall be  subject  to
      forfeiture  upon  notice and judicial determination thereof if the owner
      of such vehicle or other property or equipment has been found liable  by
      a  court of competent jurisdiction or the environmental control board on
      one or more prior  occasions  for  using  such  vehicle  or  such  other
      property or equipment in connection with an act constituting a violation
      of subdivision a of section 22-253 of this chapter.
        (ii)  A  forfeiture  proceeding  may  not  be  commenced more than ten
      business days after the receipt of a request by the owner for return  of
      the  vehicle, other property or equipment. If a forfeiture proceeding is
      not commenced within such ten day period, the property shall be returned
      to the owner upon payment of the fine or civil penalty imposed  and  the
      costs  of  removal and storage. A vehicle or other property or equipment
      which is the subject of such action shall remain in the custody  of  the
      department  or  other appropriate agency pending the final determination
      of the forfeiture action.
        (iii) Notice of the institution of  the  forfeiture  action  shall  be
      served  by first class mail on: (a) an owner of a vehicle at the address
      set forth in the records maintained by the department of motor vehicles,
      or for vehicles not  registered  in  New  York  state,  in  the  records
      maintained  by  the  state  of  registration;  (b) all persons holding a
      security interest in such vehicle which security interest has been filed
      with the department of motor vehicles  pursuant  to  the  provisions  of
      title  ten  of  the vehicle and traffic law, at the address set forth in
      the records of such department, or for vehicles not  registered  in  New
      York  state,  all  persons  who hold a security interest in such vehicle
      which security interest has been filed with such state  of  registration
      and  which persons are made known by such state to the department at the
      address provided by such state of registration; and (c) for property and
      equipment other than a  vehicle,  by  publication  in  the  city  record
      describing  such  property  or  equipment  and by notice served by first
      class mail to the address of the  person  from  whom  such  property  or
      equipment  was seized. Where such person is other than the owner of such
      property or equipment, notice shall be served by first class  mail  both
      to such person and to the owner of such property or equipment where such
      owner  is  known,  or can by reasonable effort, be ascertained or, where
      such owner is not known or cannot by reasonable effort  be  ascertained,
      to  the employer of the person from whom the property or other equipment
      was seized. Notice shall also be served  by  first  class  mail  to  any
      person  who holds a security interest in such property or equipment when
      the name and address of such person has been provided by  the  owner  of
      the  property  or  equipment  or  other person from whom the property or
      equipment was seized, or  is  otherwise  known  or  can,  by  reasonable
      effort, be ascertained.
        (iv)  Any owner who receives notice of the institution of a forfeiture
      action who wishes to claim an interest in the vehicle or other  property
      or equipment subject to forfeiture may assert a claim in such action for
      the   recovery  of  the  vehicle  or  other  property  or  equipment  or
      satisfaction of the owner's interest in such vehicle or  other  property
      or  equipment.  Any  person  with a security interest in such vehicle or
      property or equipment who receives notice  of  the  institution  of  the
      forfeiture  action  who  claims  an  interest  in  such vehicle or other
    
      property or equipment may assert a claim in such action for satisfaction
      of such person's security interest.
        (v)  Forfeiture  pursuant to this subdivision shall be made subject to
      the interest of a person who claims an interest in the vehicle or  other
      property  or  equipment  pursuant to paragraph (iv) of this subdivision,
      where such person  establishes  that:  (a)  the  use  of  such  vehicle,
      property or equipment in connection with an act constituting a violation
      of  subdivision  a  of section 22-253 of this chapter that was the basis
      for seizure occurred without the knowledge of such person,  or  if  such
      person  had  knowledge  of such use, that such person did not consent to
      such use by failing to do all that could reasonably have  been  done  to
      prevent  such  use,  and  that such person did not knowingly obtain such
      interest in the vehicle, property or equipment in  order  to  avoid  the
      forfeiture;  or (b) that the conduct that was the basis for such seizure
      was committed by any person other than such person claiming an  interest
      in  the vehicle, property or equipment while such vehicle was unlawfully
      in the possession  of  a  person  who  acquired  possession  thereof  in
      violation of the criminal laws of the United States or any state.
        (vi)  The  department,  after  judicial  determination  of forfeiture,
      shall, at its discretion, either: (a) retain such vehicle,  property  or
      equipment  for  the official use of the city; or (b) by public notice of
      at least five days, sell such forfeited vehicle, property  or  equipment
      at public sale. The net proceeds of any such sale shall be paid into the
      general fund of the city.
        (vii) In any forfeiture action commenced pursuant to this subdivision,
      where  the  court  awards  a  sum  of  money  to  one or more persons in
      satisfaction of such person's or  persons'  interest  in  the  forfeited
      vehicle, property or equipment, the total amount awarded to satisfy such
      interest or interests shall not exceed the amount of the net proceeds of
      the sale of the forfeited vehicle, property or equipment after deduction
      of  the  lawful  expenses incurred by the city, including the reasonable
      costs of removal and storage between the time of seizure and the date of
      sale.
        (viii) For purposes of this section, the term  "owner"  of  a  vehicle
      shall  mean  an owner as defined in section one hundred twenty-eight and
      in subdivision three of section three hundred eight of the  vehicle  and
      traffic  law. The term "owner" of other property or equipment subject to
      seizure or forfeiture pursuant to this section shall mean a  person  who
      demonstrates ownership of such property or equipment to the satisfaction
      of the commissioner.
        (ix)  For  purposes of this section, the term "security interest" in a
      vehicle shall mean a security interest as defined in  subdivision  k  of
      section  two  thousand  one  hundred one of the vehicle and traffic law.
      "Security interest"  in  other  property  or  equipment  shall  mean  an
      interest  reserved  or created by agreement and which secures payment or
      performance of an obligation. The term includes the interest of a lessor

      labor union or labor organization with the Secretary of  Labor  pursuant

      section  shall  inform  the  commissioner,  on  a form prescribed by the
      commissioner, of: (i) all criminal convictions, in any jurisdiction,  of

      subject  of such investigation, or (B) received a subpoena requiring the
      production of documents  or  information  in  connection  with  such  an
      investigation.  Any  material change in information reported pursuant to
      this subdivision shall be reported to  the  commissioner  within  thirty
      calendar days thereof. The commissioner may, if he or she has reasonable
      cause  to believe that such an officer lacks good character, honesty and
      integrity, require that  such  officer  be  fingerprinted  by  a  person
      designated  by the commissioner for such purpose or by the department of
      investigation and pay a fee to be submitted to the division of  criminal
      justice  services  and/or  the  federal  bureau of investigation for the
      purpose of obtaining criminal history records.
        c. The commissioner may, after notice and  opportunity  to  be  heard,
      disqualify  an  officer  of  a  labor  union  or labor organization from
      holding office when such person: (i) has failed, by the date  prescribed
      by  the  commissioner,  to  be  fingerprinted  or  to  provide  truthful
      information in connection with the reporting requirements of subdivision
      b of this section; (ii) is  the  subject  of  a  pending  indictment  or
      criminal  action  against  such officer for a crime which bears a direct
      relationship to the lawful and orderly operation of the market, in which
      case the commissioner may defer a determination  until  a  decision  has
      been reached by the court before which such action is pending; (iii) has
      been  convicted  of  a  crime  which,  under  the standards set forth in
      article 23-A of the correction law, bears a direct relationship  to  the
    
      lawful  and  orderly  operation  of  the  market, including the specific
      duties and responsibilities necessarily related to the union office; the
      bearing, if any the criminal  offense  or  offenses  will  have  on  the
      fitness  of the officer to perform such responsibilities; the time which
      has elapsed since the occurrence of the criminal  offense  or  offenses;
      the seriousness of the offense or offenses; and any information produced
      by the person, or produced on his or her behalf, in regard to his or her
      rehabilitation  or  good  conduct;  (iv)  has  committed  a racketeering
      activity or associated with  a  person  who  has  been  convicted  of  a
      racketeering  activity, including but not limited to the offenses listed
      in  subdivision  one  of  section  nineteen  hundred  sixty-one  of  the
      Racketeer  Influenced and Corrupt Organization statute (18 U.S.C. ยง 1961
      et seq.) or of an offense listed in subdivision one of section 460.10 of
      the penal law, as such statutes may be amended from time to  time,  when
      the  officer  knew  or  should have known of such conviction; or (v) has
      associated with any member or associate of an organized crime  group  as
      identified  by a federal, state or city law enforcement or investigative
      agency when the officer knew or should have known of the organized crime
      associations of such person. An officer required to disclose information
      pursuant to subdivision a of this section may submit to the commissioner
      any material or explanation which  such  officer  believes  demonstrates
      that such information does not reflect adversely upon the officer's good
      character,   honesty  and  integrity.  If  the  commissioner  determines
      pursuant to this  subdivision  that  there  are  sufficient  grounds  to
      disqualify  a  person  from  holding  office  in  a labor union or labor
      organization, the commissioner shall suspend such  person  from  holding
      office  pending  final  determination  and,  in the event such person is
      disqualified, such suspension  shall  continue  pending  resignation  or
      vacatur of or removal from office. Upon written request of the suspended
      person within ten days of the commissioner's determination, the director
      of the office of collective bargaining shall prepare a list of the names
      of  the  first fifteen arbitrators selected at random from the roster of
      arbitrators approved by the office of collective bargaining and  present
      the  first  five  names  on  such  list  to the suspended person and the
      commissioner. Within alternating  periods  of  five  business  days  the
      suspended person and then the commissioner shall each strike a name from
      the  list  of  selected  arbitrators.  If  the parties cannot within two
      additional business  days  jointly  appoint  an  arbitrator  from  those
      remaining  on  the  list, the suspended person and then the commissioner
      shall within alternating periods of two business  days  each  strike  an
      additional  name from the list. The remaining arbitrator shall thereupon
      be appointed as the arbitrator for that proceeding and shall establish a
      schedule for such proceeding. In the event that such arbitrator declines
      the appointment or for any reason is unable to accept  the  appointment,
      then  the  director  of the office of collective bargaining shall within
      five business days present to the suspended person and the  commissioner
      the  next  five  names on the list of arbitrators previously selected at
      random and the procedures set forth in this subdivision  for  appointing
      an  arbitrator  shall be applied to this second group. In the event that
      the arbitrator appointed from this second group declines the appointment
      or for any reason is unable to accept the appointment then the  director
      of  the office of collective bargaining shall present the remaining five
      names from the list arbitrators selected at  random  and  the  suspended
      person shall select an arbitrator from such group. Such arbitrator shall
      make  a  final  report  and  recommendations  in  writing concerning the
      disqualification.  The  commissioner  shall  accept  such   report   and
      recommendations and issue his or her final determination consistent with
      such  report and recommendations. In the event that the suspended person
    
      does not make a request for arbitration within the ten-day period he  or
      she  shall  be disqualified from holding office. Upon receiving an order
      of the commissioner pursuant to this subdivision disqualifying a  person
      from  holding office in a labor union or labor organization, such person
      shall resign or vacate such office within  fourteen  days  or,  if  such
      person  fails  to  resign or vacate such office within such time period,
      such union or organization shall remove such person forthwith from  such
      office.  Failure of such a person to resign or vacate office within such
      time period shall subject such person to  the  penalties  set  forth  in
      subdivision a of section 22-258 of this chapter. An officer who has been
      disqualified or suspended by the commissioner pursuant to the provisions
      of this subdivision may be excluded by the commissioner from the market.
      Nothing in this section shall be construed to authorize the commissioner
      to  disqualify  a labor union or labor organization from representing or
      seeking to represent employees of a business required to  be  registered
      pursuant to section 22-253 of this code.
        d. In reaching a determination to fingerprint or disqualify an officer
      of  a  labor union or labor organization pursuant to subdivisions b or c
      of this section, the commissioner shall give substantial weight  to  the
      results  of  any investigation conducted by an independent investigator,
      monitor, trustee or other person or body charged with the  investigation
      or  oversight  of  such  labor  union  or  labor organization, including
      whether such investigation has failed to  return  charges  against  such
      officer.
        e.  Notwithstanding  any  other  provision  of  this  chapter  to  the
      contrary, the provisions of this section shall apply to any labor  union
      or  labor organization representing or seeking to represent employees of
      business required to be licensed or registered pursuant to  chapter  1-A
      of  this  title  in  the  fulton  fish market distribution area or other
      seafood distribution area. The term  "market"  shall,  for  purposes  of
      application  of the provisions of this section to the fulton fish market
      distribution or other seafood distribution area, mean such areas.

      the commissioner may by rule require, including but not limited  to  the
      names  of  all  members  of  such association and of all persons holding
      office in  such  association.  The  commissioner  may  promulgate  rules
      requiring  that  an  association  required  to register pursuant to this
      section maintain financial statements, records, ledgers, receipts, bills
      and such other  written  records  as  the  commissioner  determines  are
      necessary  or useful for carrying out the purposes of this chapter. Such
      records shall be maintained for a period of  time  not  to  exceed  five
      years  to  be determined by rule by the commissioner; provided, however,
      that such rule may  provide  that  the  commissioner  may,  in  specific
      instances  at  his or her discretion, require that records be maintained
      for a period of time exceeding five years. Such records  shall  be  made
      available for inspection and audit at the request of the commissioner at
      either the offices of the association or the offices of the department.
        b.  An  officer  of a wholesale trade association required to register
      pursuant to this section  shall  inform  the  commissioner,  on  a  form
      prescribed by the commissioner, of: (i) all criminal convictions, in any
      jurisdiction,  of  such  officer;  (ii)  any  pending  civil or criminal
      actions to which such officer is a party;  and  (iii)  any  criminal  or
      civil  investigation by a federal, state, or local prosecutorial agency,
      investigative agency or regulatory  agency,  in  the  five  year  period
      preceding  the  date  of  registration pursuant to subdivision a of this
      section and at any time subsequent to such  registration,  wherein  such
      officer  has (A) been the subject of such investigation, or (B) received
      a subpoena requiring the  production  of  documents  or  information  in
      connection   with   such   an  investigation.  Any  material  change  in
      information reported pursuant to this subdivision shall be  reported  to
      the  commissioner  within thirty calendar days thereof. The commissioner
      may, if he or she has reasonable cause to believe that such  an  officer
      of  a  trade  association  lacks  good character, honesty and integrity,
      require that such officer be fingerprinted by a person designated by the
      commissioner for such and pay a fee to be submitted to the  division  of
      criminal justice for the purpose of obtaining criminal history records.
        c.  The  commissioner  may,  after notice and opportunity to be heard,
      disqualify a person from holding office in a wholesale trade association
      when such person:  (i)  has  failed,  by  the  date  prescribed  by  the

      connection with the reporting requirements  of  subdivision  b  of  this
      section;  (ii) is the subject of a pending indictment or criminal action
      against such officer for a crime  which  bears  a  relationship  to  the
      lawful   and  orderly  operation  of  the  market,  in  which  case  the
      commissioner may defer a determination pending a  determination  by  the
      court before which such action is pending; (iii) has been convicted of a
      crime  which, under the standards of article 23-A of the correction law,
      bears a relationship to the lawful and orderly operation of the  market;
      (iv)  has  committed a racketeering activity or associated with a person
      who has been convicted of a racketeering  activity,  including  but  not
      limited  to  the  offenses listed in subdivision one of section nineteen
      hundred sixty-one of the Racketeer Influenced and  Corrupt  Organization
      statute (18 U.S.C. ยง 1961 et seq) or of an offense listed in subdivision
      one  of section 460.10 of the penal law, as such statutes may be amended
      from time to time, when the officer knew or should have  known  of  such
      conviction;  or  (v)  has  associated with any member or associate of an
      organized crime group as identified by a  federal,  state  or  city  law
    
      enforcement or investigative agency when the officer knew or should have
      known  of  the  organized  crime associations of such person. An officer
      required to disclose information  pursuant  to  subdivision  a  of  this
      section may submit to the commissioner any material or explanation which
      such  officer  believes demonstrates that the officer does not lack good
      character, honesty  and  integrity.  Upon  receiving  an  order  of  the
      commissioner  pursuant  to  this subdivision disqualifying a person from
      holding office in a  wholesale  trade  association,  such  person  shall
      vacate such office or, if such person fails to vacate such office within
      the  time  period  specified by the commissioner, such association shall
      remove such person forthwith from such office. Failure of such person to
