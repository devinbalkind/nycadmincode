Section 8-101 ::    
        
     
        ยง 8-101 Policy.
        In the city of New York, with its great cosmopolitan population, there
      is  no  greater  danger to the health, morals, safety and welfare of the
      city and its inhabitants than the existence of groups prejudiced against
      one another and antagonistic to each other because of  their  actual  or
      perceived differences, including those based on race, color, creed, age,
      national   origin,   alienage  or  citizenship  status,  gender,  sexual
      orientation, disability, marital status, partnership status, any  lawful
      source of income, status as a victim of domestic violence or status as a
      victim  of  sex  offenses  or  stalking, whether children are, may be or
      would be residing with a person or  conviction  or  arrest  record.  The
      council  hereby finds and declares that prejudice, intolerance, bigotry,
      and discrimination, bias-related violence  or  harassment  and  disorder
      occasioned  thereby  threaten  the  rights  and proper privileges of its
      inhabitants and  menace  the  institutions  and  foundation  of  a  free
      democratic  state.  A  city  agency  is  hereby  created  with  power to
      eliminate and prevent discrimination from playing any  role  in  actions
      relating  to  employment,  public  accommodations, and housing and other
      real estate, and to take other actions against  prejudice,  intolerance,
      bigotry,  discrimination  and  bias-related  violence  or  harassment as
      herein provided; and the  commission  established  hereunder  is  hereby
      given general jurisdiction and power for such purposes.

        (a) For an employer or an employee or agent thereof,  because  of  the
      actual  or  perceived  age, race, creed, color, national origin, gender,
      disability, marital status, partnership status,  sexual  orientation  or
      alienage  or  citizenship  status  of  any  person, to refuse to hire or
      employ or to bar or to discharge  from  employment  such  person  or  to
      discriminate against such person in compensation or in terms, conditions
      or privileges of employment.
        (b)  For  an  employment  agency  or  an  employee or agent thereof to
      discriminate against any person  because  of  such  person's  actual  or
      perceived  age, race, creed, color, national origin, gender, disability,
      marital status, partnership status, sexual orientation  or  alienage  or
      citizenship  status  in  receiving,  classifying, disposing or otherwise
      acting upon applications for its services or in referring  an  applicant
      or applicants for its services to an employer or employers.
        (c)  For a labor organization or an employee or agent thereof, because
      of the actual or perceived age, race,  creed,  color,  national  origin,
      gender,   disability,   marital   status,   partnership  status,  sexual
      orientation or alienage or citizenship status of any person, to  exclude
      or  to  expel  from its membership such person or to discriminate in any
      way against any of its members or against any  employer  or  any  person
      employed by an employer.
        (d)  For  any  employer, labor organization or employment agency or an
      employee or agent thereof to declare, print or circulate or cause to  be
      declared,   printed   or  circulated  any  statement,  advertisement  or
      publication, or to use any form of application for employment or to make
      any inquiry in connection with prospective employment, which  expresses,
      directly  or indirectly, any limitation, specification or discrimination
      as to age, race, creed,  color,  national  origin,  gender,  disability,
      marital  status,  partnership  status, sexual orientation or alienage or
      citizenship  status,  or  any  intent  to  make  any  such   limitation,
      specification or discrimination.
        (e)  The  provisions  of  this subdivision and subdivision two of this
      section: (i) as they apply to  employee  benefit  plans,  shall  not  be
      construed  to  preclude an employer from observing the provisions of any
      plan covered by the federal employment retirement income security act of
      nineteen hundred seventy-four that  is  in  compliance  with  applicable
      federal  discrimination  laws where the application of the provisions of
      such subdivisions to such plan would be  preempted  by  such  act;  (ii)
      shall  not  preclude  the varying of insurance coverages according to an
      employee's age; (iii) shall not be construed to  affect  any  retirement
      policy  or system that is permitted pursuant to paragraph (e) and (f) of
      subdivision three-a of section two hundred ninety-six of  the  executive
      law;  (iv)  shall  not  be  construed to affect the retirement policy or
      system of an employer where such policy or system is not a subterfuge to
      evade the purposes of this chapter.
        (f) The provisions of this subdivision shall not govern the employment
      by an employer of his or  her  parents,  spouse,  domestic  partner,  or
      children;  provided,  however, that such family members shall be counted
      as persons employed by an employer for the purposes of subdivision  five
      of section 8-102 of this chapter.
        2.   Apprentice   training   programs.   It   shall   be  an  unlawful
      discriminatory practice for an employer, labor organization,  employment
      agency  or  any  joint labor-management committee controlling apprentice
      training programs or an employee or agent thereof:
    
        (a) To select persons for an apprentice  training  program  registered
      with the state of New York on any basis other than their qualifications,
      as determined by objective criteria which permit review.
        (b)  To  deny  to  or  withhold  from any person because of his or her
      actual or perceived race, creed, color, national  origin,  gender,  age,
      disability,  marital  status,  partnership status, sexual orientation or
      alienage  or  citizenship  status  the  right  to  be  admitted  to   or
      participate  in  a  guidance  program,  an  apprentice training program,

      retraining program.
        (c)  To  discriminate against any person in his or her pursuit of such
      program  or  to  discriminate  against  such  a  person  in  the  terms,
      conditions  or privileges of such program because of actual or perceived
      race, creed, color, national origin, gender,  age,  disability,  marital
      status,   partnership   status,   sexual   orientation  or  alienage  or
      citizenship status.
        (d) To declare, print or circulate or cause to be declared, printed or
      circulated any statement, advertisement or publication, or  to  use  any
      form  of  application  for  such  program  or  to  make  any  inquiry in
      connection with such program which expresses,  directly  or  indirectly,
      any  limitation,  specification  or  discrimination  as  to race, creed,
      color,  national  origin,  gender,  age,  disability,  marital   status,
      partnership  status,  sexual  orientation  or  alienage  or  citizenship
      status, or any intent to make  any  such  limitation,  specification  or
      discrimination.
        3.  Employment;  religious  observance.  (a)  It  shall be an unlawful
      discriminatory practice for an employer or an employee or agent  thereof
      to  impose  upon  a  person  as  a  condition  of obtaining or retaining
      employment any terms or conditions, compliance with which would  require
      such  person  to  violate,  or forego a practice of, his or her creed or
      religion, including but not limited to the observance of any  particular
      day  or  days  or  any  portion  thereof as a sabbath or holy day or the
      observance of any religious custom or usage, and the employer shall make
      reasonable accommodation to the religious needs of such person.  Without
      in any way limiting the foregoing, no person shall be required to remain
      at  his  or  her  place  of employment during any day or days or portion
      thereof that, as a requirement of such  person's  religion,  he  or  she
      observes  as  a  sabbath  or other holy day, including a reasonable time
      prior and subsequent thereto for travel between  his  or  her  place  of
      employment and his or her home, provided, however, that any such absence
      from  work  shall, wherever practicable in the judgment of the employer,
      be made up by an equivalent  amount  of  time  at  some  other  mutually
      convenient time.
        (b)  "Reasonable  accommodation",  as  used in this subdivision, shall
      mean such accommodation  to  an  employee's  or  prospective  employee's
      religious  observance  or  practice as shall not cause undue hardship in
      the conduct of the employer's business.  The  employer  shall  have  the
      burden  of proof to show such hardship. "Undue hardship" as used in this
      subdivision shall mean an accommodation requiring significant expense or
      difficulty (including  a  significant  interference  with  the  safe  or
      efficient  operation  of  the  workplace  or  a violation of a bona fide
      seniority system). Factors to be considered in determining  whether  the
      accommodation  constitutes an undue economic hardship shall include, but
      not be limited to:
        (i) the identifiable cost of the accommodation, including the costs of
      loss  of  productivity  and  of  retaining  or   hiring   employees   or
      transferring  employees from one facility to another, in relation to the
      size and operating cost of the employer;
    
        (ii)  the  number  of  individuals  who  will  need   the   particular
      accommodation to a sincerely held religious observance or practice; and
        (iii)  for  an  employer with multiple facilities, the degree to which
      the geographic separateness or administrative or fiscal relationship  of
      the facilities will make the accommodation more difficult or expensive.
        Provided,  however, an accommodation shall be considered to constitute
      an undue hardship, for purposes of this subdivision, if it  will  result
      in the inability of an employee who is seeking a religious accommodation
      to perform the essential functions of the position in which he or she is
      employed.
        4.  Public  accommodations.  a. It shall be an unlawful discriminatory
      practice for any person, being the owner, lessee,  proprietor,  manager,
      superintendent,  agent  or  employee  of any place or provider of public
      accommodation, because of the actual or perceived  race,  creed,  color,
      national  origin,  age,  gender, disability, marital status, partnership
      status, sexual orientation or alienage  or  citizenship  status  of  any
      person, directly or indirectly, to refuse, withhold from or deny to such
      person  any  of the accommodations, advantages, facilities or privileges
      thereof, or, directly or indirectly, to make any  declaration,  publish,
      circulate,   issue,  display,  post  or  mail  any  written  or  printed
      communication, notice or advertisement, to the effect that  any  of  the
      accommodations,  advantages, facilities and privileges of any such place
      or provider shall be refused, withheld from or denied to any  person  on
      account of race, creed, color, national origin, age, gender, disability,
      marital  status,  partnership  status, sexual orientation or alienage or
      citizenship status or  that  the  patronage  or  custom  of  any  person
      belonging  to,  purporting  to be, or perceived to be, of any particular
      race, creed, color, national origin, age,  gender,  disability,  marital
      status,   partnership   status,   sexual   orientation  or  alienage  or
      citizenship  status  is  unwelcome,  objectionable  or  not  acceptable,
      desired or solicited.
        b.  Notwithstanding  the foregoing, the provisions of this subdivision
      shall not apply, with respect to age or gender, to places  or  providers
      of  public  accommodation where the commission grants an exemption based
      on bona fide considerations of public policy.
        c. The provisions of this subdivision relating  to  discrimination  on
      the  basis  of  gender  shall  not  prohibit any educational institution
      subject to this subdivision from making gender distinctions which  would
      be  permitted  (i)  for  educational  institutions  which are subject to
      section thirty-two hundred one-a of the education law or  any  rules  or
      regulations  promulgated by the state commissioner of education relating
      to gender or (ii)  under  sections  86.32,  86.33  and  86.34  of  title
      forty-five   of   the   code  of  federal  regulations  for  educational
      institutions covered thereunder.
        d. Nothing in this subdivision  shall  be  construed  to  preclude  an
      educational  institution  --  other than a publicly-operated educational
      institution -- which establishes or  maintains  a  policy  of  educating
      persons  of  one gender exclusively from limiting admissions to students
      of that gender.
        e. The provisions of this subdivision  relating  to  disparate  impact
      shall  not  apply to the use of standardized tests as defined by section
      three hundred forty of the education law by an  educational  institution
      subject  to  this  subdivision  provided  that  such test is used in the
      manner and for the purpose prescribed by the test agency which  designed
      the test.
        f.  The  provisions  of  this  subdivision  as they relate to unlawful
      discriminatory practices by educational institutions shall not apply  to
      matters that are strictly educational or pedagogic in nature.
    
        5.   Housing   accommodations,  land,  commercial  space  and  lending
      practices.    (a)  Housing  accommodations.  It  shall  be  an  unlawful
      discriminatory  practice  for  the  owner,  lessor,  lessee,  sublessee,

      sell,  rent  or  lease or approve the sale, rental or lease of a housing
      accommodation, constructed or to be constructed, or an interest therein,
      or any agent or employee thereof:
        (1) To refuse to sell, rent, lease, approve the sale, rental or  lease

      actual  or  perceived  race, creed, color, national origin, gender, age,
      disability, sexual orientation, marital status, partnership  status,  or
      alienage  or citizenship status of such person or persons, or because of
      any lawful source of income  of  such  person  or  persons,  or  because
      children are, may be or would be residing with such person or persons.
        (2) To discriminate against any person because of such person's actual
      or   perceived   race,  creed,  color,  national  origin,  gender,  age,
      disability, sexual orientation, marital status, partnership  status,  or
      alienage  or  citizenship  status,  or  because  of any lawful source of
      income of such person, or because children  are,  may  be  or  would  be
      residing with such person, in the terms, conditions or privileges of the
      sale,  rental  or lease of any such housing accommodation or an interest
      therein or in the furnishing of facilities  or  services  in  connection
      therewith.
        (3) To declare, print or circulate or cause to be declared, printed or
      circulated  any  statement,  advertisement or publication, or to use any
      form of application for the purchase, rental or lease of such a  housing
      accommodation or an interest therein or to make any record or inquiry in
      conjunction  with  the  prospective  purchase, rental or lease of such a
      housing accommodation or an interest therein which  expresses,  directly
      or  indirectly,  any  limitation,  specification or discrimination as to
      race, creed, color, national origin,  gender,  age,  disability,  sexual
      orientation,   marital   status,  partnership  status,  or  alienage  or
      citizenship status, or any lawful source of income, or whether  children
      are,  may  be, or would be residing with a person, or any intent to make
      such limitation, specification or discrimination.
        (4) The provisions of this paragraph (a) shall not apply:
        (1)  to  the  rental  of  a  housing  accommodation,  other   than   a
      publicly-assisted  housing  accommodation,  in a building which contains
      housing  accommodations  for  not  more   than   two   families   living
      independently  of  each  other,  if  the owner or members of the owner's

      with  applications  for such financial assistance, or in connection with
      the appraisal of any housing accommodation, land or commercial space  or
      an  interest  therein,  which  expresses,  directly  or  indirectly, any
      limitation, specification or discrimination as to  race,  creed,  color,
      national  origin,  gender,  disability, sexual orientation, age, marital
      status, partnership  status,  or  alienage  or  citizenship  status,  or
      whether children are, may be, or would be residing with a person.
        (e)  Real  estate  services.  It  shall  be an unlawful discriminatory
      practice to deny a person access to, or membership in  or  participation
      in,  a  multiple  listing service, real estate brokers' organization, or
      other service because of the actual or  perceived  race,  creed,  color,
      national  origin,  gender,  disability, sexual orientation, age, marital
      status, partnership status, or alienage or citizenship  status  of  such
      person  or  because  children are, may be or would be residing with such
      person.
        (f)  Real  estate  related  transactions.  It  shall  be  an  unlawful
      discriminatory  practice  for  any  person  whose  business includes the
      appraisal  of  housing  accommodations,  land  or  commercial  space  or
      interest  therein  or  an  employee  or agent thereof to discriminate in
      making available or in the terms or conditions of such appraisal on  the
      basis  of  the  actual or perceived race, creed, color, national origin,
    
      gender, disability, sexual orientation, age, marital status, partnership
      status, or alienage or citizenship  status  of  any  person  or  because
      children are, may be or would be residing with such person.
        (g) Applicability; persons under eighteen years of age. The provisions
      of this subdivision, as they relate to unlawful discriminatory practices
      in  housing  accommodations,  land  and  commercial space or an interest
      therein and lending practices on the basis of age, shall  not  apply  to
      unemancipated persons under the age of eighteen years.
        (h)  Applicability;  discrimination against persons with children. The
      provisions of this subdivision with respect  to  discrimination  against
      persons  with  whom  children are, may be or would be residing shall not
      apply to housing for older persons as  defined  in  paragraphs  two  and
      three  of  subdivision  (b) of section thirty-six hundred seven of title
      forty-two of the United States  code  and  any  regulations  promulgated
      thereunder.
        (i)  Applicability;  senior  citizen  housing.  The provisions of this
      subdivision with respect to discrimination on the basis of age shall not
      apply to the restriction of the sale, rental or  lease  of  any  housing
      accommodation,   land   or  commercial  space  or  an  interest  therein
      exclusively to persons fifty-five years of age or older. This  paragraph
      shall  not  be  construed  to permit discrimination against such persons
      fifty-five years of age or older on the basis of whether  children  are,
      may  be or would be residing in such housing accommodation or land or an
      interest therein  unless  such  discrimination  is  otherwise  permitted
      pursuant to paragraph (h) of this subdivision.
        (j)   Applicability;   dormitory  residence  operated  by  educational
      institution.  The   provisions   of   this   subdivision   relating   to
      discrimination  on  the  basis of gender in housing accommodations shall
      not prohibit any educational institution from making gender distinctions
      in dormitory residences which would be permitted  under  sections  86.32
      and  86.33  of  title  forty-five of the code of federal regulations for
      educational institutions covered thereunder.
        (k)  Applicability;   dormitory-type   housing   accommodations.   The
      provisions  of this subdivision which prohibit distinctions on the basis
      of gender and whether children are, may be or would be residing  with  a
      person   shall   not  apply  to  dormitory-type  housing  accommodations
      including, but not limited to, shelters  for  the  homeless  where  such
      distinctions  are  intended  to  recognize  generally accepted values of
      personal modesty and privacy or to protect the health, safety or welfare
      of families with children.
        (l)  Exemption  for  special  needs  of  particular   age   group   in
      publicly-assisted  housing  accommodations.  Nothing in this subdivision
      shall  restrict  the   consideration   of   age   in   the   rental   of
      publicly-assisted  housing accommodations if the state division of human
      rights grants an exemption pursuant to section two hundred ninety-six of
      the executive law based on bona fide considerations of public policy for
      the purpose of providing for the special needs of a particular age group
      without the intent of prejudicing other age  groups;  provided  however,
      that  this  paragraph shall not be construed to permit discrimination on
      the basis of whether children are, may be or would be residing  in  such
      housing accommodations unless such discrimination is otherwise permitted
      pursuant to paragraph (h) of this section.
        (m)    Applicability;   use   of   criteria   or   qualifications   in
      publicly-assisted  housing  accommodations.  The  provisions   of   this
      subdivision  shall  not  be construed to prohibit the use of criteria or
      qualifications of eligibility for the sale, rental, leasing or occupancy
      of publicly-assisted  housing  accommodations  where  such  criteria  or
      qualifications  are required to comply with federal or state law, or are
    
      necessary to obtain the benefits of a federal or state  program,  or  to
      prohibit   the   use   of   statements,   advertisements,  publications,
      applications or inquiries to the extent that they state such criteria or
      qualifications  or  request information necessary to determine or verify
      the eligibility of an applicant, tenant, purchaser, lessee or occupant.
        (n) Discrimination on the basis of occupation  prohibited  in  housing
      accommodations.  Where a housing accommodation or an interest therein is
      sought or occupied exclusively for residential purposes, the  provisions
      of this subdivision shall be construed to prohibit discrimination in the
      sale,  rental,  or  leasing  of  such  housing accommodation or interest
      therein and in the terms, conditions and privileges of the sale,  rental
      or  leasing of such housing accommodation or interest therein and in the
      furnishing of facilities or services in connection therewith, on account
      of a person's occupation.
        (o) Applicability; lawful source of income.  The  provisions  of  this
      subdivision,  as they relate to unlawful discriminatory practices on the
      basis  of  lawful  source  of  income,  shall  not  apply   to   housing
      accommodations  that  contain  a  total  of five or fewer housing units,
      provided, however:
        (i) the provisions of this subdivision shall apply to tenants  subject
      to rent control laws who reside in housing accommodations that contain a
      total  of five or fewer units at the time of the enactment of this local
      law; and provided, however
        (ii) the provisions of this subdivision shall  apply  to  all  housing
      accommodations,  regardless of the number of units contained in each, of
      any person who has the right to sell, rent or lease or approve the sale,
      rental or lease of at least one housing accommodation  within  New  York
      City  that  contains  six  or  more  housing units, constructed or to be
      constructed, or an interest therein.
        6. Aiding  and  abetting.  It  shall  be  an  unlawful  discriminatory
      practice for any person to aid, abet, incite, compel or coerce the doing
      of any of the acts forbidden under this chapter, or to attempt to do so.
        7.  Retaliation.  It  shall be an unlawful discriminatory practice for
      any person engaged in any activity to  which  this  chapter  applies  to
      retaliate  or discriminate in any manner against any person because such
      person has (i) opposed any practice forbidden under this  chapter,  (ii)
      filed  a  complaint,  testified or assisted in any proceeding under this
      chapter, (iii) commenced a civil action alleging the  commission  of  an
      act  which  would  be  an  unlawful  discriminatory  practice under this
      chapter, (iv) assisted the commission or the corporation counsel  in  an
      investigation  commenced  pursuant  to  this  title, or (v) provided any
      information to the commission pursuant to the terms  of  a  conciliation
      agreement   made   pursuant  to  section  8-115  of  this  chapter.  The
      retaliation or discrimination complained of under this subdivision  need
      not  result in an ultimate action with respect to employment, housing or
      a public accommodation or in a materially adverse change  in  the  terms
      and  conditions  of  employment,  housing,  or  a  public accommodation,
      provided, however, that the retaliatory or discriminatory  act  or  acts
      complained  of must be reasonably likely to deter a person from engaging
      in protected activity.
        8. Violation of  conciliation  agreement.  It  shall  be  an  unlawful
      discriminatory  practice  for any party to a conciliation agreement made
      pursuant to section 8-115 of this chapter to violate the terms  of  such
      agreement.
        9.  Licenses  and  permits.  It  shall  be  an unlawful discriminatory
      practice:
        (a) Except as otherwise provided  in  paragraph  (c),  for  an  agency
      authorized  to  issue  a  license  or  permit  or an employee thereof to
    
      discriminate against an applicant for a license or permit because of the
      actual or perceived race, creed, color, national  origin,  age,  gender,
      marital  status,  partnership  status, disability, sexual orientation or
      alienage or citizenship status of such applicant.
        (b)  Except  as  otherwise  provided  in  paragraph (c), for an agency
      authorized to issue a license  or  permit  or  an  employee  thereof  to
      declare,  print  or  circulate  or  cause  to  be  declared,  printed or
      circulated any statement, advertisement or publication, or  to  use  any
      form  of  application  for a license or permit or to make any inquiry in
      connection with any  such  application,  which  expresses,  directly  or
      indirectly,  any limitation, specification or discrimination as to race,
      creed, color, national origin, age, gender, marital status,  partnership
      status,  disability,  sexual  orientation  or  alienage  or  citizenship
      status, or any intent to make  any  such  limitation,  specification  or
      discrimination.
        (c) Nothing contained in this subdivision shall be construed to bar an
      agency  authorized  to  issue  a  license  or  permit  from using age or
      disability as a criterion for determining eligibility for a  license  or
      permit  when  specifically  required  to do so by any other provision of
      law.
        10. Criminal conviction.  (a)  It  shall  be  unlawful  discriminatory
      practice  for  any person to deny any license or permit or employment to
      any person by reason of his or her having been convicted of one or  more
      criminal  offenses,  or  by reason of a finding of a lack of "good moral
      character" which is based on his or her having been convicted of one  or
      more  criminal  offenses,  when  such  denial  is  in  violation  of the
      provisions of article twenty-three-a of the correction law.
        (b) Pursuant to section seven hundred  fifty-five  of  the  correction
      law,  the  provisions  of  this subdivision shall be enforceable against
      public  agencies  by  a   proceeding   brought   pursuant   to   article
      seventy-eight of the civil practice law and rules, and the provisions of
      this  subdivision  shall be enforceable against private employers by the
      commission through the administrative procedure  provided  for  in  this
      chapter  or  as  provided in chapter five of this title. For purposes of
      this paragraph only, the terms "public agency"  and  "private  employer"
      shall  have  the meaning given such terms in section seven hundred fifty
      of the correction law.
        11. Arrest record. It shall be an  unlawful  discriminatory  practice,
      unless  specifically  required  or  permitted  by any other law, for any
      person to make any inquiry about, whether in any form of application  or
      otherwise,  or  to act upon adversely to the person involved, any arrest
      or criminal accusation of such person  not  then  pending  against  that
      person  which  was  followed by a termination of that criminal action or
      proceeding in favor of such person, as defined  in  subdivision  two  of
      section  160.50  of  the  criminal procedure law, in connection with the
      licensing, employment or providing of credit to such  person;  provided,
      however,  that the prohibition of such inquiries or adverse action shall
      not apply to licensing activities in relation to the regulation of guns,
      firearms and other deadly weapons or in relation to an  application  for
      employment  as  a  police  officer  or  peace officer as those terms are
      defined in subdivisions thirty-three and thirty-four of section 1.20  of
      the criminal procedure law.
        12.  Religious  principles. Nothing contained in this section shall be
      construed  to  bar  any  religious  or  denominational  institution   or
      organization  or any organization operated for charitable or educational
      purposes,  which  is  operated,  supervised  or  controlled  by  or   in
      connection  with  a  religious organization, from limiting employment or
      sales or rental of housing accommodations  or  admission  to  or  giving
    
      preference  to  persons  of  the  same  religion or denomination or from
      making such selection as is calculated by such organization  to  promote
      the religious principles for which it is established or maintained.
        13.  Employer  liability for discriminatory conduct by employee, agent
      or independent contractor.  a.  An  employer  shall  be  liable  for  an
      unlawful  discriminatory  practice based upon the conduct of an employee
      or agent which is in violation of any provision of  this  section  other
      than subdivisions one and two of this section.
        b. An employer shall be liable for an unlawful discriminatory practice
      based  upon the conduct of an employee or agent which is in violation of
      subdivision one or two of this section only where:
        (1)  the  employee  or  agent  exercised  managerial  or   supervisory
      responsibility; or
        (2)  the  employer  knew  of  the employee's or agent's discriminatory
      conduct, and acquiesced in such conduct or failed to take immediate  and
      appropriate  corrective  action;  an  employer  shall  be deemed to have
      knowledge of an employee's or agent's discriminatory conduct where  that
      conduct  was known by another employee or agent who exercised managerial
      or supervisory responsibility; or
        (3) the employer should  have  known  of  the  employee's  or  agent's
      discriminatory  conduct  and  failed to exercise reasonable diligence to
      prevent such discriminatory conduct.
        c. An employer shall be liable for an unlawful discriminatory practice
      committed by a person employed as an independent contractor, other  than
      an  agent  of  such  employer,  to  carry out work in furtherance of the
      employer's business enterprise only where  such  discriminatory  conduct
      was  committed  in  the  course  of such employment and the employer had
      actual knowledge of and acquiesced in such conduct.
        d. Where liability of an employer has  been  established  pursuant  to
      this  section  and is based solely on the conduct of an employee, agent,
      or independent contractor, the employer shall be permitted to plead  and
      prove  that  prior  to the discriminatory conduct for which it was found
      liable it had:
        (1) Established and complied with policies,  programs  and  procedures
      for the prevention and detection of unlawful discriminatory practices by
      employees,  agents  and  persons  employed  as  independent contractors,
      including but not limited to:
        (i) A meaningful and responsive procedure for investigating complaints
      of discriminatory practices by employees, agents and persons employed as
      independent contractors and for taking appropriate action against  those
      persons who are found to have engaged in such practices;
        (ii)  A  firm  policy  against  such  practices  which  is effectively
      communicated to employees, agents and persons  employed  as  independent
      contractors;
        (iii)  A  program  to  educate  employees  and  agents  about unlawful
      discriminatory practices under local, state and federal law; and
        (iv) Procedures for the supervision of employees and  agents  and  for
      the   oversight   of   persons   employed   as  independent  contractors
      specifically directed at the prevention and detection of such practices;
      and
        (2)  A  record  of  no,  or  relatively  few,   prior   incidents   of
      discriminatory  conduct by such employee, agent or person employed as an
      independent contractor or other employees, agents or persons employed as
      independent contractors.
        e. The demonstration of any or all of  the  factors  listed  above  in
      addition to any other relevant factors shall be considered in mitigation
      of  the  amount  of  civil  penalties  to  be  imposed by the commission
      pursuant to this chapter or in mitigation of civil penalties or punitive
    
      damages which may be imposed pursuant to chapter four or  five  of  this
      title  and  shall  be  among  the  factors  considered in determining an
      employer's liability under subparagraph three of  paragraph  b  of  this
      subdivision.
        f.  The  commission  may  establish  by  rule  policies,  programs and
      procedures which may be implemented by employers for the prevention  and
      detection  of unlawful discriminatory practices by employees, agents and
      persons employed as independent contractors. Notwithstanding  any  other
      provision  of law to the contrary, an employer found to be liable for an
      unlawful discriminatory practice based  solely  on  the  conduct  of  an
      employee,  agent  or  person  employed  as an independent contractor who
      pleads and proves that such policies, programs and procedures  had  been
      implemented  and complied with at the time of the unlawful conduct shall
      not be liable for any civil penalties which may be imposed  pursuant  to
      this  chapter  or  any  civil penalties or punitive damages which may be
      imposed pursuant to chapter four or five of this title for such unlawful
      discriminatory practices.
        14. Applicability; alienage or citizenship status. Notwithstanding any
      other  provision  of  this  section,  it  shall  not  be   an   unlawful
      discriminatory  practice for any person to discriminate on the ground of
      alienage or citizenship status, or to make any inquiry as to a  person's
      alienage or citizenship status, or to give preference to a person who is
      a  citizen  or  national  of the United States over an equally qualified
      person who is an alien, when such discrimination  is  required  or  when
      such  preference  is expressly permitted by any law or regulation of the
      United States, the state of New York or the city of New York,  and  when
      such  law  or regulation does not provide that state or local law may be
      more protective of aliens; provided, however, that this provision  shall
      not   prohibit   inquiries   or  determinations  based  on  alienage  or
      citizenship status  when  such  actions  are  necessary  to  obtain  the
      benefits  of  a  federal  program.  An applicant for a license or permit
      issued by the city of New York may be required to be authorized to  work
      in  the  United States whenever by law or regulation there is a limit on
      the number of such licenses or permits which may be issued.
        15. Applicability; persons with disabilities.
        (a) Requirement to make  reasonable  accommodation  to  the  needs  of
      persons  with  disabilities.  Except  as  provided in paragraph (b), any
      person prohibited by the provisions of this section from  discriminating
      on the basis of disability shall make reasonable accommodation to enable
      a  person with a disability to satisfy the essential requisites of a job
      or enjoy the right or rights in question provided that the disability is
      known or should have been known by the covered entity.
        (b) Affirmative defense in disability cases. In  any  case  where  the
      need  for  reasonable  accommodation  is placed in issue, it shall be an
      affirmative  defense  that  the  person   aggrieved   by   the   alleged
      discriminatory   practice  could  not,  with  reasonable  accommodation,
      satisfy the essential requisites of the job or enjoy the right or rights
      in question.
        (c) Use of drugs or alcohol. Nothing contained in this  chapter  shall
      be  construed  to  prohibit  a  covered  entity from (i) prohibiting the
      illegal use of drugs or the use of alcohol at the workplace or  on  duty
      impairment  from the illegal use of drugs or the use of alcohol, or (ii)
      conducting drug testing which is otherwise lawful.
        16. Applicability; sexual orientation.
        Nothing in this chapter shall be construed to:
        a. Restrict an employer's right to insist that an employee  meet  bona
      fide job-related qualifications of employment;
    
        b.  Authorize  or  require  employers  to establish affirmative action
      quotas based on sexual orientation or to make  inquiries  regarding  the
      sexual orientation of current or prospective employees;
        c.  Limit  or override the present exemptions in the human rights law,
      including those relating to employment  concerns  employing  fewer  than
      four  persons,  as  provided  in  subdivision  five  of  section  8-102;
      owner-occupied dwellings, as provided in paragraph  (a)  of  subdivision
      five of section 8-107; or any religious or denominational institution or
      organization, or any organization operated for charitable or educational
      purposes,   which  is  operated,  supervised  or  controlled  by  or  in
      connection with a religious organization,  as  provided  in  subdivision
      twelve of section 8-107 of this chapter;
        d. Make lawful any act that violates the penal law of the state of New
      York; or
        e. Endorse any particular behavior or way of life.
        17. Disparate impact.
        a.  An unlawful discriminatory practice based upon disparate impact is
      established when:
        (1) the commission or a person who may bring an action  under  chapter
      four  or  five of this title demonstrates that a policy or practice of a
      covered entity or a group of policies or practices of a  covered  entity
      results in a disparate impact to the detriment of any group protected by
      the provisions of this chapter; and
        (2)  the  covered  entity  fails  to plead and prove as an affirmative
      defense  that  each  such  policy  or  practice  bears   a   significant
      relationship  to  a significant business objective of the covered entity
      or does not contribute to the disparate impact; provided, however,  that
      if  the  commission  or such person who may bring an action demonstrates
      that a group of policies or practices results in a disparate impact, the
      commission or such person shall not be  required  to  demonstrate  which
      specific  policies  or  practices  within  the  group  results  in  such
      disparate impact; provided further, that a policy or practice  or  group
      of  policies  or  practices demonstrated to result in a disparate impact
      shall be unlawful where the commission or such person who may  bring  an
      action  produces  substantial  evidence  that  an  alternative policy or
      practice with less disparate impact is available to the  covered  entity
      and  the  covered  entity fails to prove that such alternative policy or
      practice would not  serve  the  covered  entity  as  well.  "Significant
      business  objective"  shall  include,  but not be limited to, successful
      performance of the job.
        b. The mere existence of a statistical  imbalance  between  a  covered
      entity's  challenged  demographic composition and the general population
      is not alone sufficient to establish a prima  facie  case  of  disparate
      impact  violation  unless  the  general  population  is  shown to be the
      relevant pool for comparison, the imbalance is shown to be statistically
      significant and there is an identifiable policy or practice or group  of
      policies or practices that allegedly causes the imbalance.
        c. Nothing contained in this subdivision shall be construed to mandate
      or  endorse the use of quotas; provided, however, that nothing contained
      in this subdivision shall  be  construed  to  limit  the  scope  of  the
      commission's  authority  pursuant  to  sections  8-115 and 8-120 of this
      chapter or to affect court-ordered  remedies  or  settlements  that  are
      otherwise in accordance with law.
        18.   Unlawful   boycott   or  blacklist.  It  shall  be  an  unlawful
      discriminatory practice (i) for  any  person  to  discriminate  against,

      orientation or alienage or citizenship status of a person with whom such

      the circumstances  surrounding  an  applicant's  separation  from  prior
      employment.
        (2)  Nothing  set  forth  in  this  subdivision  shall be construed as
      prohibiting an employer,  employment  agency,  or  agent  thereof,  when
      making  employment decisions with regard to hiring, compensation, or the
      terms, conditions or privileges  of  employment,  from  considering  any

      respect   to   compensation   or  terms,  conditions  or  privileges  of

      city of New York, shall be deemed to have the same employer.
        c. Applicability of subdivision. (1) This subdivision shall not  apply
      to:  (a)  actions  taken  by  the  New  York city department of citywide
      administrative services in furtherance of its  responsibility  for  city
      personnel matters pursuant to chapter thirty-five of the charter or as a
      municipal  civil  service commission administering the civil service law
      and other applicable laws, or by the mayor in furtherance of the mayor's
      duties  relating  to  city  personnel  matters   pursuant   to   chapter
      thirty-five   of  the  charter,  including,  but  not  limited  to,  the
      administration  of  competitive  examinations,  the  establishment   and
      administration   of   eligible   lists,   and   the   establishment  and
      implementation of minimum qualifications for appointment to positions;
        (b) actions taken by officers or employees of other public agencies or
      entities charged with performing functions comparable to those performed
      by the department of citywide administrative services or  the  mayor  as
      described in paragraph one of this subdivision;
        (c)  agency  appointments to competitive positions from eligible lists
      pursuant to subsection one of  section  sixty-one  of  the  state  civil
      service law; or
        (d) the exercise of any right of an employer or employee pursuant to a
      collective bargaining agreement.
        (2)  This  subdivision shall apply to individual hiring decisions made
      by an agency or entity with respect to positions for which  appointments
      are  not  required  to  be  made  from an eligible list resulting from a
      competitive examination.
        d. Public education campaign. The commission shall develop courses  of
      instruction and conduct ongoing public education efforts as necessary to
      inform  employers,  employment  agencies, and job applicants about their
      rights and responsibilities under this subdivision.
        e. Disparate impact. An  unlawful  discriminatory  practice  based  on
      disparate  impact  under  this  subdivision is established when: (1) the
      commission or a person who may bring an action  under  chapter  four  or
      five  of  this  title  demonstrates  that  a  policy  or  practice of an
      employer, employment agency, or agent thereof, or a group of policies or
      practices of such an  entity  results  in  a  disparate  impact  to  the
      detriment  of any group protected by the provisions of this subdivision;
      and (2) such entity fails to plead and prove as an  affirmative  defense
      that  each  such  policy  or  practice  has as its basis a substantially
      job-related qualification  or  does  not  contribute  to  the  disparate
      impact; provided, however, that if the commission or such person who may
    
      bring  an  action  demonstrates  that  a  group of policies or practices
      results in a disparate impact, the commission or such person  shall  not
      be  required  to demonstrate which specific policies or practices within
      the  group  results  in  such disparate impact; provided further, that a
      policy or practice or group of policies  or  practices  demonstrated  to
      result  in  a disparate impact shall be unlawful where the commission or
      such person who may bring an action produces substantial  evidence  that
      an  alternative  policy  or  practice  with  less  disparate  impact  is
      available to such entity and  such  entity  fails  to  prove  that  such
      alternative  policy  or  practice would not serve such entity as well. A
      "substantially job-related qualification"  shall  include,  but  not  be
      limited  to, a current and valid professional or occupational license; a
      certificate, registration, permit, or other credential; a minimum  level
      of   education   or  training;  or  a  minimum  level  of  professional,
      occupational, or field experience.
        (22)  Employment;  Pregnancy,  childbirth,  or   a   related   medical
      condition.  (a)  It  shall be an unlawful discriminatory practice for an
      employer to refuse to provide a reasonable accommodation, as defined  in
      subdivision  eighteen  of section 8-102 of this chapter, to the needs of
      an employee for her pregnancy, childbirth, or related medical  condition
      that  will allow the employee to perform the essential requisites of the
      job, provided that such employee's  pregnancy,  childbirth,  or  related
      medical condition is known or should have been known by the employer. In
      any  case  pursuant  to  this  subdivision where the need for reasonable
      accommodation is placed in issue, it shall  be  an  affirmative  defense
      that  the  person aggrieved by the alleged discriminatory practice could
      not, with reasonable accommodation, satisfy the essential requisites  of
      the job.
        (b)  Notice of rights. (i) An employer shall provide written notice in
      a form and manner to be determined by the commission of the right to  be
      free  from  discrimination  in  relation  to  pregnancy, childbirth, and
      related medical conditions pursuant to  this  subdivision  to:  (1)  new
      employees  at the commencement of employment; and (2) existing employees
      within one hundred twenty days after the effective date of the local law
      that added this subdivision.  Such  notice  may  also  be  conspicuously
      posted  at  an  employer's  place  of  business in an area accessible to
      employees. (ii) The commission shall develop courses of instruction  and
      conduct   ongoing  public  education  efforts  as  necessary  to  inform
      employers, employees, employment  agencies,  and  job  applicants  about
      their rights and responsibilities under this subdivision.
        (c)  This  subdivision  shall  not  be  construed  to affect any other
      provision of law relating to sex discrimination or pregnancy, or in  any
      way  to  diminish  the  coverage  of pregnancy, childbirth, or a medical
      condition related to pregnancy or childbirth under any  other  provision
      of this section.

      is  cohabiting with or has cohabited with the victim, by a person who is
      or has been in  a  continuing  social  relationship  of  a  romantic  or

      or at regular intervals lived in the same household as the victim.
        c. "Victim of sex offenses or stalking" shall mean a  victim  of  acts
      which  would constitute violations of article 130 of the penal law, or a
      victim of acts which would constitute  violations  of  sections  120.45,

        d.  Practices  "based on," "because of," "on account of," "as to," "on

      include, but are not limited to, those based solely upon the actions  of
      a  person  who  has  perpetrated acts or threats of violence against the
      individual.
        2.  Unlawful  discriminatory  practices.  It  shall  be  an   unlawful
      discriminatory  practice for an employer, or an agent thereof, to refuse
      to hire or employ or to bar or  to  discharge  from  employment,  or  to
      discriminate  against  an  individual  in  compensation  or other terms,
      conditions, or  privileges  of  employment  because  of  the  actual  or
      perceived status of said individual as a victim of domestic violence, or
      as a victim of sex offenses or stalking.
        3.  Applicability;  actual  or perceived victims of domestic violence,
      sex offenses or stalking.
        (a) Requirement to make  reasonable  accommodation  to  the  needs  of
      victims  of  domestic  violence,  sex  offenses  or  stalking. Except as
      provided in paragraph (c), any person prohibited by this section 8-107.1
      from discriminating on the basis of actual  or  perceived  status  as  a

      shall make reasonable accommodation to enable a person who is  a  victim
      of domestic violence, or a victim of sex offenses or stalking to satisfy
      the  essential  requisites of a job provided that the status as a victim
      of domestic violence or a victim of sex offenses or stalking is known or

      The person requesting reasonable accommodation pursuant to paragraph (a)
      shall  provide a copy of such certification to the covered entity within
      a reasonable period after the request is made. A person may satisfy  the
      certification  requirement  of this paragraph by providing documentation
      from an employee, agent, or volunteer of a victim services organization,
      an attorney, a member of the clergy, or a medical or other  professional
      service   provider,  from  whom  the  individual  seeking  a  reasonable
      accommodation or that individual's family or household member has sought
      assistance in addressing domestic violence, sex offenses or stalking and
      the effects of the violence or stalking; a police or  court  record;  or
      other  corroborating  evidence.  All information provided to the covered
      entity pursuant to this paragraph, including a statement of  the  person
    
      requesting  a  reasonable  accommodation  or  any  other  documentation,
      record, or corroborating evidence, and the fact that the individual  has
      requested  or  obtained  a  reasonable  accommodation  pursuant  to this
      section,  shall  be  retained in the strictest confidence by the covered
      entity, except to the extent that disclosure is requested  or  consented
      to  in writing by the person requesting the reasonable accommodation; or
      otherwise required by applicable federal, state or local law.
        (c) Affirmative defense in domestic violence, sex offenses or stalking
      cases. In any case where the need for reasonable accommodation is placed
      in issue, it shall be an affirmative defense that the  person  aggrieved
      by  the  alleged  discriminatory  practice  could  not,  with reasonable
      accommodation, satisfy the essential requisites of the job or enjoy  the
      right or rights in question.

      thereby.
        b.  The  commission  shall  dismiss  a  complaint  for  administrative
      convenience  at  any  time  prior  to  the  filing  of  an answer by the

      discriminatory  harassment  or  violence  as set forth in chapter six of
      this title, the commission  shall  dismiss  the  complaint  as  to  such

        b. Where the commission has initiated its  own  investigation  or  has
      conducted  an investigation in connection with the filing of a complaint
      pursuant to this chapter, the commission may demand that any  person  or
      persons  who  are  the  subject of such investigation (i) preserve those
      records in the possession of such person or persons which  are  relevant

      orders   otherwise,  the  assertion  of  an  objection  shall  not  stay
      compliance with the demand. The commission shall make a determination on
      an objection to a demand within thirty days after such an  objection  is
      filed  with  the  commission,  unless  the  party  filing  the objection
      consents to an extension of time.
        d. Upon the expiration of the time set  pursuant  to  such  rules  for
      making  an  objection  to  such  demand, or upon a determination that an
      objection to the demand shall not be  sustained,  the  commission  shall

      their  peril. Any destruction, defacement, alteration or removal of such
      notice by the owner or the  owner's  agents  or  employees  shall  be  a
      misdemeanor  punishable on conviction thereof by a fine of not more than

        (d) An order that the noncomplying party may not be heard to object to
      the introduction and use of secondary evidence to show what the withheld

      shown; and
        (e)  Infer  that  the material or testimony is withheld or records not
      preserved, made, kept, produced or made available for inspection because
      such material, testimony or records would prove to be unfavorable to the
      noncomplying party and use such inference to establish facts in  support
      of a final determination pursuant to section 8-120 of this chapter.
