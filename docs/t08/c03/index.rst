Section 8-301 ::    
        
     
        ยง  8-301  Legislative  declaration. It is hereby found that the letter
      and spirit of the constitution of the United States are  being  violated
      in  some  jurisdictions  under color of law with the result that persons
      from this city and state, as  well  as  from  other  states,  are  being
      subjected   to   discriminatory  treatment  in  the  exercise  of  their
      constitutional rights because of race or because they seek  the  removal
      of  unconstitutional  barriers  to equal rights. Such persons, sometimes
      referred  to  as  freedom  riders  and  sit-ins,  intent  upon  peaceful
      resistance  to  discrimination,  segregation  and the achievement of the
      constitutional rights of all persons in all jurisdictions of the  United
      States,  have  suffered the stigma of criminal proceedings. It is hereby
      declared to be the policy of the city to  remove  or  to  neutralize  by
      affording  to  such  residents  appropriate relief to the fullest extent
      possible, the effect upon  residents  of  this  city  of  such  criminal
      proceedings,  resulting  from the attempted use of public transportation
      facilities and other places of public accommodation.
