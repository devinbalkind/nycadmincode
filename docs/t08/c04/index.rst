Chapter 4 - CIVIL ACTION TO ELIMINATE UNLAWFUL DISCRIMINATORY PRACTICES
=======================================================================

Section 8-401
-------------

Section 8-401 ::    
        
     
        ยง  8-401 Legislative declaration. The council finds that certain forms
      of  unlawful  discrimination  are  systemic  in  nature  rooted  in  the
      operating  conditions or policies of a business or industry. The council
      finds that the existence of systemic discrimination poses a  substantial
      threat  to,  and  inflicts  significant  injury  upon,  the city that is
      economic, social and moral in character, and is distinct from the injury
      sustained by individuals as an  incident  of  such  discrimination.  The
      council  finds  that the potential for systemic discrimination exists in
      all areas of  public  life  and  that  employment,  housing  and  public
      accommodations  are  among  the  areas  in which the economic effects of
      systemic discrimination  are  exemplified.  The  existence  of  systemic
      discrimination  impedes  the  optimal efficiency of the labor market by,
      among other things, causing decisions to employ,  promote  or  discharge
      persons   to  be  based  upon  reasons  other  than  qualifications  and
      competence. Such discrimination impedes the optimal  efficiency  of  the
      housing  market and retards private investments in certain neighborhoods
      by causing decisions to lease or sell housing accommodations to be based
      upon discriminatory factors and not  upon  ability  and  willingness  to
      lease  or purchase property. The council finds that the reduction in the
      efficiency  of  the  labor,  housing  and  commercial  markets   has   a
      detrimental  effect on the city's economy, thereby reducing revenues and
      increasing costs to the city.  The  council  finds  that  such  economic
      injury to the city severely diminishes its capacity to meet the needs of
      those persons living and working in, and visiting, the city. The council
      finds  further  that  the  social  and  moral  consequences  of systemic
      discrimination are similarly injurious to  the  city  in  that  systemic
      discrimination   polarizes   the  city's  communities,  demoralizes  its
      inhabitants and creates disrespect for the law, thereby frustrating  the
      city's  efforts  to  foster  mutual  respect  and  tolerance  among  its
      inhabitants and to promote a safe and secure  environment.  The  council
      finds  that  the  potential  consequences  to  the  city of this form of
      discrimination requires that the corporation counsel be expressly  given
      the  authority  to  institute a civil action to enforce the city's human
      rights law so as to supplement administrative means to prevent or remedy
      injury to the city.

Section 8-402 ::    
        
     
        ยง  8-402  Civil action to eliminate unlawful discriminatory practices.
      a.  Whenever there is reasonable cause to believe that a person or group
      of persons is engaged in a pattern  or  practice  that  results  in  the
      denial  to  any  person  of  the  full enjoyment of any right secured by
      chapter one of this title, a civil action on behalf of the commission or
      the city may be commenced in  a  court  of  competent  jurisdiction,  by
      filing  a  complaint  setting  forth facts pertaining to such pattern or
      practice and requesting such relief as may be deemed necessary to insure
      the full enjoyment of the rights described in such  chapter,  including,
      but  not  limited  to,  injunctive  relief,  damages, including punitive
      damages, and such other types of relief as are specified in  subdivision

      construed to prohibit (i) an aggrieved person from  filing  a  complaint
      pursuant  to  section  8-109  of  chapter  one  of  this  title  or from
      commencing a civil action pursuant to chapter five of this  title  based
      upon  the  same  facts  pertaining  to such a pattern or practice as are
      alleged in the civil action,  or  (ii)  the  commission  from  filing  a
      commission-initiated  complaint pursuant to section 8-109 of chapter one
      of this title alleging a pattern or practice of discrimination, provided
      that a civil action pursuant to this section shall not  have  previously
      been commenced.
        b.  A  civil  action  commenced  under  this section must be commenced
      within three years after the alleged discriminatory practice occurred.
        c. Such action may be instituted only by the corporation counsel, such
      attorneys employed by  the  city  commission  on  human  rights  as  are
      designated by the corporation counsel or other persons designated by the
      corporation counsel.

Section 8-403 ::    
        
     
        ยง  8-403  Investigation.  The  corporation  counsel  may  initiate any
      investigation to ascertain such  facts  as  may  be  necessary  for  the
      commencement  of  a  civil  action  pursuant  to  section  8-402 of this
      chapter, and in connection therewith  shall  have  the  power  to  issue

Section 8-404

Section 8-404 ::    
        
     
        ยง  8-404  Civil  penalty.  In  any  civil action commenced pursuant to
      section 8-402 of this chapter, the trier of fact may, to  vindicate  the
      public  interest, impose upon any person who is found to have engaged in
      a pattern or practice that results in the denial to any  person  of  the
      full enjoyment of any right secured by chapter one of this title a civil
      penalty of not more than two hundred fifty thousand dollars. In relation
      to  determining  the appropriate amount of civil penalties to be imposed
      pursuant to this section a liable party may plead and prove any relevant
      mitigating factor. Any civil penalties so  recovered  pursuant  to  this
      chapter shall be paid into the general fund of the city. Nothing in this
      section shall be construed to preclude the city from recovering damages,
      including  punitive  damages, and other relief pursuant to section 8-402
      of this chapter in addition to civil penalties.
