Section 11-623 ::    
        
     
        §  11-623 Imposition of tax. 1. Pursuant to the authority conferred by
      section fifty-two hundred nineteen of the United States revised statutes
      and in conformity with the provisions  contained  in  subdivision  c  of
      clause one of such section, every national banking association organized
      under  authority of the United States and located within the city, shall
      annually pay a tax, measured by its  net  income,  to  be  computed,  as
      provided  in  this  part,  at  the  rate of four and one-half per centum
      except  that  for  the  year  nineteen  hundred  seventy-one  and  those
      following  the  rate  shall  be  five and sixty-three one hundredths per
      centum, upon the basis of its net income  for  the  calendar  year  next
      preceding  the date when such tax becomes due. Such tax shall be for the
      calendar year next preceding the year in which it  becomes  due;  except
      that  with  respect  to national banking associations required to file a
      declaration of estimated tax and to make payments  on  account  of  such
      estimated  tax  in  accordance  with the provisions of section 11-636 of
      this subchapter, all payments of tax within  a  calendar  year,  whether
      computed  on the basis of net income for the current calendar year or on
      the basis of net income for the preceding calendar year,  shall  be  for
      the  calendar  year  in  which the payments are required to be made. If,
      however, such a national banking association shall be dissolved  between
      the  thirty-first  day  of  December  and  the  succeeding second day of
      September,  and  shall  not  become  merged  or  consolidated   with   a
      corporation  taxable  under  part one of this subchapter, it shall pay a
      tax for the period from the thirty-first day of December up to the  time
      of  dissolution  equal  to that which would have been payable had it not
      been dissolved, except that such tax shall be reduced by  one-third  and
      an  additional  one-twelfth  for  each  month, or major portion thereof,
      prior to such succeeding second day  of  September,  during  which  such
      corporation  was  so  dissolved.  If such dissolution occurs between the
      fifteenth day of March and the second day  of  September,  and  if  such
      corporation  shall  have filed its return on or before the fifteenth day
      of March as required by sections 11-630 and 11-633 of  this  subchapter,
      it  may  file  a  claim for refund as provided in section 11-678 of this
      chapter, showing any reduction in tax to which it  may  be  entitled  as
      provided  in  the  preceding sentence; and if it shall be made to appear
      that the amount of tax due is less than the amount as  computed  on  the
      basis  of  the original return, the commissioner of finance shall adjust
      the computation of tax accordingly. If the amount of tax as so  adjusted
      shall  be  less  than  the  amount theretofore paid, the excess shall be
      refunded by the commissioner of finance as provided in  subdivision  one
      of section 11-677 of this chapter.
        2.  In  the event that the taxes imposed by this part shall be finally
      determined to be unconstitutional or invalid for the reason that they do
      not conform with the provisions of section fifty-two hundred nineteen of
      the United States revised statutes, then, in lieu of the  taxes  imposed
      by  the  provisions of this part, every national banking association and
      every production credit  association  that  otherwise  would  have  been
      subject to tax under this part shall be subject to the tax imposed under
      subchapter  two  as  of July thirteenth, nineteen hundred sixty-six, and
      all of the provisions of subchapter two, unless  clearly  inappropriate,
      shall  be  applicable  except subdivision four of section 11-603 of this
      chapter; and, in such event, any payments made, reports or returns filed
      or any act of the commissioner of finance or of a  taxpayer  purportedly
      under  this  subchapter  shall  be treated as though made, filed or done
      pursuant to subchapter two.
        3. Cross reference. For years for which tax is  imposed,  see  section
      11-624 of this part.

Section 11-624 ::    
        
     
        § 11-624 Years for which imposed. 1. The tax imposed by section 11-623
      of  this  part  is  imposed  for  each calendar year included within the
      period beginning January first, nineteen hundred  sixty-six  and  ending
      December thirty-first, nineteen hundred seventy-two.
        2. Cross reference. For tax imposed for years or periods subsequent to
      nineteen hundred seventy-two, see part four of this subchapter.
    
    
    
    
    
    
    

Section 11-625
--------------

Section 11-625 ::    
        
     
        §  11-625  Ascertainment of gain or loss; exchange of property. 1. For
      the purpose of ascertaining the gain derived or loss sustained from  the
      sale  or  other  disposition  of  property, real, personal or mixed, the
      basis shall be the  cost  thereof,  or  the  inventoried  value  if  the
      inventory is made in accordance with section 11-626 of this part.
        2.  Notwithstanding  subdivision  one of this section, with respect to
      gain derived from the sale or other disposition of any property acquired
      prior to January first, nineteen  hundred  sixty-six,  except  stock  in
      trade  of  the taxpayer or other property of a kind which would properly
      be included in the inventory of the taxpayer if on hand at the close  of
      the taxable year, or property held by the taxpayer primarily for sale to
      customers  in  the ordinary course of its trade or business and accounts
      or notes receivable acquired in the ordinary course of trade or business
      from the sale of such stock  in  trade  or  property,  or  for  services
      rendered, net income shall not include:
        (a)  That  portion  of  the  gain  included  in determining net income
      pursuant to subdivision one of this section with respect  to  each  such
      property which exceeds:
        (b)  The amount of gain, if any, that would be included in determining
      net income pursuant to subdivision one of this section with  respect  to
      each  such property if the basis of such property on the date of sale or
      other disposition were equal to its fair market value on January  first,
      nineteen  hundred sixty-six, plus or minus all adjustments to basis made
      with respect to each such property in computing net income  for  periods
      on or after January first, nineteen hundred sixty-six; provided that the
      total  adjustment  to  net income provided by this subdivision shall not
      exceed the amount of the taxpayer's net gain  from  the  sale  or  other
      disposition  of all such property, as determined pursuant to subdivision
      one of this section.
        3. Upon the sale or exchange of property the amount  of  the  gain  or
      loss  shall  be determined in the manner prescribed by section 11-615 of
      this subchapter and the basis of such property shall  be  determined  in
      the manner prescribed by section 11-616 of this subchapter.
        4.  In  the  case  of  any bond, with respect to which a deduction for
      amortizable bond premium is allowable under paragraph (i) of subdivision
      one of section 11-629 of this part, the basis for  determining  gain  or
      loss  shall  be  reduced  by  the  total  amount  of  such deductions so
      allowable.
    
    
    
    
    
    
    

Section 11-626
--------------

Section 11-626 ::    
        
     
        §  11-626  Inventory.  Whenever  in the opinion of the commissioner of
      finance the  use  of  inventories  is  necessary  in  order  clearly  to
      determine  the  income of any taxpayer, inventory shall be taken by such
      taxpayer upon such basis as the commissioner of finance  may  prescribe,
      conforming  as  nearly  as may be to the best accounting practice in the
      banking business and most clearly reflecting the income.
    
    
    
    
    
    
    

Section 11-627
--------------

Section 11-627 ::    
        
     
        §  11-627 Net income defined; computation. The term "net income" means
      the gross income of a taxpayer less the deductions allowed by this part.
      The net income shall be  computed  in  accordance  with  the  method  of
      accounting regularly employed in keeping the books of such taxpayer; but
      if  no  such method of accounting has been so employed, or if the method
      employed does not clearly reflect the income, the computation  shall  be
      made  upon  such  basis  and  in  such  manner  as in the opinion of the
      commissioner of finance does clearly reflect the income. In  determining
      net  income,  war  losses,  taxation of property recovered, and basis of
      property shall be treated in  substantially  the  same  manner  as  such
      losses, recoveries and basis are treated under the applicable provisions
      of section thirteen hundred thirty-one of the internal revenue code.
    
    
    
    
    
    
    

Section 11-628
--------------

Section 11-628 ::    
        
     
        §  11-628  Gross  income  defined. 1. The term "gross income" includes
      gains, profit and income derived from the business, of whatever kind and
      in whatever form paid, including gains, profits or income from  dealings
      in  property,  whether  real  or  personal, or gains, profits, or income
      received as compensation for services, as interest, rents,  commissions,
      brokerage  or  other  fees,  or  otherwise in carrying on such business,
      including all dividends received on stocks  and  all  interest  received
      from federal, state, municipal or other bonds.
        2. If the gross income of such an association is derived from business
      carried  on  both within and without the city, "gross income" means that
      proportion thereof which is derived from business carried on within  the
      city, to be allocated and determined on the basis of separate accounting
      for  each  office  or  branch or, at the election of the taxpayer, under
      rules and regulations prescribed by the commissioner of finance.
    
    
    
    
    
    
    

Section 11-629
--------------

Section 11-629 ::    
        
     
        § 11-629 Deductions. 1. In computing net income there shall be allowed
      as deductions:
        (a)  All  the  ordinary and necessary expenses paid or incurred during
      the year in carrying on business, including a reasonable  allowance  for
      salaries  or other compensation for personal services actually rendered,
      and including rentals or  other  payments  required  to  be  made  as  a
      condition  to  the  continued use or possession for business purposes of
      property to which the taxpayer has not taken or is not taking  title  or
      in which such taxpayer has no equity;
        (b) All interest paid or accrued during the year on indebtedness;
        (c)  Taxes,  other  than  taxes  on  income or profits paid or accrued
      within the year, imposed, first, by the authority of the United  States,
      or of any of its possessions, or, second, by the authority of any state,
      or  territory,  or  any  county, school district, municipality, or other
      taxing subdivisions of any  state  or  territory,  not  including  those
      assessed  against local benefits of a kind tending to increase the value
      of the property assessed, or, third, by the  authority  of  any  foreign
      government;
        (d)  Losses  sustained  during  the  year  and  not compensated for by
      insurance or otherwise, if incurred in  business;  unless  in  order  to
      clearly  reflect  the  income  the  losses  should in the opinion of the
      commissioner of finance be accounted for as of a  different  period.  No
      deduction  shall  be allowed for any loss claimed to have been sustained
      in any sale or other disposition of shares of stock or securities  where
      it appears that within thirty days before or after the date of such sale
      or  other  disposition the taxpayer has acquired substantially identical
      property, and the property so acquired is held by the taxpayer  for  any
      period  after  such sale or other disposition, unless such claim is made
      with respect to a transaction made in the ordinary course  of  business.
      If  such  acquisition  is  to  the  extent of part only of substantially
      identical property, only a proportionate  part  of  the  loss  shall  be
      disallowed;
        (e) Debts ascertained to be worthless and charged off within the year;
      or  in  the  discretion  of  the  commissioner  of  finance a reasonable
      addition to a reserve for bad debts.  When  satisfied  that  a  debt  is
      recoverable  only  in  part,  the commissioner of finance may allow such
      debt to be charged off in part;
        (f) A reasonable allowance  for  the  exhaustion,  wear  and  tear  of
      property   used  in  business,  including  a  reasonable  allowance  for
      obsolescence. In the case of any such property acquired  before  January
      first, nineteen hundred sixty-six, the amount of such deduction shall be
      equal to the deduction properly taken for such property in reporting the
      tax  due  pursuant  to  article  nine-c  of the tax law. With respect to
      property such as described in paragraph (j) of  this  subdivision,  this
      deduction may be computed and allowed as provided therein;
        (g) If the gross income be derived from business carried on within and
      without  the  city,  the  deductions  allowed  by  this section shall be
      allocated and determined on the basis of separate  accounting  for  each
      office  or  branch  or, at the election of the taxpayer, under rules and
      regulations to be prescribed by the commissioner of finance;
        (h) In the case of  any  taxpayer,  who  establishes  or  maintains  a
      pension  trust  to provide for the payment of reasonable pensions to its
      employees, there shall be allowed as a deduction  (in  addition  to  the
      contributions  to  such  trust  during  the  taxable years, to cover the
      pension liability accruing during the year, allowed as a deduction under
      paragraph (a) of this subdivision) a reasonable  amount  transferred  or
      paid  into  such  trust  during  the  taxable  year  in  excess  of such
      contributions, but only if such amount: (1)  has  not  theretofore  been
    
      allowable  as  a deduction, and (2) is apportioned in equal parts over a
      period of ten consecutive years beginning with the  year  in  which  the
      transfer  of  payment  is  made;  provided  that said deduction shall be
      allowable  only  with respect to a taxable year (whether the year of the
      transfer or payment or a subsequent year) of the taxpayer ending  within
      or  with a taxable year of the trust with respect to which the trust, by
      reason of its purposes or activities is exempt from federal income tax;
        (i) The amount of the amortizable bond premium on a bond for the  year
      shall  be  allowed  as a deduction as hereinafter provided. In computing
      such deduction, (a) the amount of the bond premium shall  be  determined
      with  reference to the amount of the basis (for determining loss on sale
      or exchange) of such bond, and with reference to the amount  payable  on
      maturity  or  on  earlier  call date, with adjustments proper to reflect
      unamortized bond premium with respect to the bond, for the period  prior
      to  July  thirteenth,  nineteen  hundred  sixty-six  with respect to the
      taxpayer with respect to such bond, and (b) the amortizable bond premium
      of the year shall be the amount of the bond premium attributable to such
      year. The determinations required in the  preceding  sentence  shall  be
      made  in accordance with the method of amortizing bond premium regularly
      employed by the holder of such bond, if such method is  reasonable,  and
      in all other cases in accordance with regulations of the commissioner of
      finance  prescribing reasonable methods of amortizing bond premium. This
      paragraph shall apply only if the taxpayer shall so elect, in accordance
      with regulations of the commissioner of finance, and such election shall
      be made separately with respect to: (1) bonds, the interest of which  is
      wholly  taxable,  and  (2)  bonds,  the  interest  of which is wholly or
      partially tax exempt, for purposes of the income tax imposed by  chapter
      one  of the internal revenue code. If such election is made with respect
      to any bond of the taxpayer described in clauses one or two  hereof,  it
      shall  also apply to all bonds in the same class held by the taxpayer at
      the beginning of the first year to which the election applies and to all
      such bonds thereafter acquired by  it  and  shall  be  binding  for  all
      subsequent years with respect to all such bonds of the taxpayer, unless,
      upon  application  by  the taxpayer, the commissioner of finance permits
      the taxpayer, subject to such conditions as the commissioner of  finance
      deems necessary, to revoke such election. As used in this paragraph, the
      term  "bond"  means  any  bond, debenture, note, or certificate or other
      evidence of indebtedness, issued by any corporation and bearing interest
      (including any like obligation  issued  by  a  government  or  political
      subdivision  thereof),  with interest coupons or in registered form, but
      does not include any such obligation which constitutes stock in trade of
      the taxpayer or any such obligation of a kind which  would  properly  be
      included in the inventory of the taxpayer if on hand at the close of the
      year,  or any such obligation held by the taxpayer primarily for sale to
      customers in the ordinary course of its trade or business; and
        (j) (1) At the election of the taxpayer there shall be  deducted  from
      gross  income,  or  if  gross income is derived from business carried on
      within and without this city, from the portion thereof allocated  within
      the city, depreciation with respect to any property such as described in
      subparagraph (2) of this paragraph, not exceeding twice the depreciation
      allowed  with  respect  to  the  same  property  for  federal income tax
      purposes.
        (2) Such deduction shall be allowed  only  with  respect  to  tangible
      property   which   is   depreciable  pursuant  to  section  one  hundred
      sixty-seven of the internal revenue code, having a situs  in  this  city
      and  used  in the taxpayer's business, (i) constructed, reconstructed or
      erected  after  December  thirty-first,  nineteen  hundred   sixty-five,
      pursuant  to  a  contract which was, on or before December thirty-first,
    
      nineteen hundred sixty-seven, and at all times  thereafter,  binding  on
      the  taxpayer  or  pursuant  to  an  order  placed on or before December
      thirty-first, nineteen hundred sixty-seven, by purchase  as  defined  in
      section  one  hundred seventy-nine (d), of the internal revenue code, if
      the original use of such property commenced with the taxpayer, commenced
      in this city and commenced after December thirty-first, nineteen hundred
      sixty-five or (iii) acquired,  constructed,  reconstructed,  or  erected
      subsequent  to  December  thirty-first, nineteen hundred sixty-seven, if
      such acquisition, construction, reconstruction or erection  is  pursuant
      to  a plan of the taxpayer which was in existence December thirty-first,
      nineteen hundred sixty-seven and not thereafter substantially  modified,
      and  such  acquisition,  construction,  reconstruction or erection would
      qualify under the rules in paragraph four, five or six of subsection (h)
      of section  forty-eight  of  the  internal  revenue  code  provided  all
      references  in  such  paragraphs four, five and six to the dates October
      nine, nineteen hundred sixty-six,  and  October  ten,  nineteen  hundred
      sixty-six,   shall  read  as  December  thirty-first,  nineteen  hundred
      sixty-seven. A taxpayer shall be allowed a deduction under  clause  (i),
      (ii)  or  (iii) of this paragraph only if the tangible property shall be
      delivered or the  construction,  reconstruction  or  erection  shall  be
      completed   on   or   before  December  thirty-first,  nineteen  hundred
      sixty-nine, except in the case of tangible property which  is  acquired,
      constructed,  reconstructed or erected pursuant to a contract which was,
      on or before December thirty-first, nineteen hundred sixty-seven, and at
      all times thereafter, binding on the taxpayer.  Provided,  however,  for
      any  taxable  year beginning on or after January first, nineteen hundred
      sixty-eight, a taxpayer shall not be allowed a deduction under paragraph
      (a) hereof with respect to tangible personal property leased  by  it  to
      any other person or corporation. For purposes of the preceding sentence,
      any  contract or agreement to lease or rent or for a license to use such
      property shall be considered a lease. With respect to property which the
      taxpayer uses itself for purposes other  than  leasing  for  part  of  a
      taxable year and leases for a part of a taxable year, the taxpayer shall
      be  allowed a deduction under paragraph (a) in proportion to the part of
      the year it uses such property.
        (3) If the deduction allowable for any taxable year pursuant  to  this
      subdivision  exceeds  the  taxpayer's  net  income  computed without the
      allowance of such deduction and without the allowance of  any  deduction
      pursuant  to  paragraph  (f)  of this section with reference to the same
      property, the excess may be carried over to the following  taxable  year
      or  years  and  may be deducted in computing net income for such year or
      years.
        (4) In any taxable year when property is sold  or  otherwise  disposed
      of,  with respect to which a deduction has been allowed pursuant to this
      paragraph, the gain or loss thereon shall be computed by  adjusting  the
      basis  of such property to reflect the deductions so allowed, and if the
      taxpayer's gross income is derived from business carried on both  within
      and  without  the  city,  shall  be allocated within the city. Provided,
      however, that no loss shall be  recognized  for  the  purposes  of  this
      paragraph  with  respect to a sale or other disposition of property to a
      person whose acquisition thereof is not a purchase as defined in section
      one hundred seventy-nine (d) of the internal revenue code.
        2. In computing net income no deduction shall in any case  be  allowed
      in respect of:
        (a)   Any   amount  paid  out  for  new  buildings  or  for  permanent
      improvements or betterments made to increase the value of any property.
        (b) Any amount expended in restoring or in making good the  exhaustion
      thereof for which an allowance is or has been made.

      gain  or  loss  ascertained,   deductions   made,   apportionments   and
      allocations  determined,  at  the  same  time  and  subject  to the same

Section 11-631 ::    
        
     
        §  11-631  Tax  on  production  credit  associations.  Pursuant to the
      authority conferred by the federal farm credit act of  nineteen  hundred
      thirty-three,  every  production  credit association organized under the
      authority of the United States and located within  the  city  after  the
      stock  held  in it by the federal production credit corporation has been
      retired shall annually pay a tax measured by its net income, which shall
