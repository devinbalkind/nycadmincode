Section 11-633 ::    
        
     
        ยง  11-633  Taxpayer's  returns.  1. Every taxpayer, on or before March
      fifteenth of  each  year,  beginning  with  the  year  nineteen  hundred
      sixty-seven  and  ending  with  the year nineteen hundred seventy-three,
      shall make a return subscribed by  the  taxpayer  and  affirmed  by  the
      taxpayer  to  be true under the penalties of perjury to the commissioner
      of finance, for the calendar year next preceding, as to the business  or
      that  portion  of the business of such taxpayer the income from which is
      the basis of taxation under part one or two of this  subchapter,  except
      that   every   trust   company  and  savings  bank  which  shall  become
      incorporated between the thirty-first day of December and the succeeding
      first day of July, shall make its return for such period  on  or  before
      September  first,  and  every  taxpayer,  other than a trust company and
      savings bank, which shall commence to do business in the city or  become
      located  in  the  city,  shall  make its return for the calendar year in
      which it commences to do business or becomes located, on or  before  the
      twentieth  day of January of the year succeeding such calendar year, and
      except that every taxpayer, other than a trust company and savings bank,
      which shall be dissolved, cease to do business in the city or  cease  to
      be located in the city, between the thirty-first day of December and the
      succeeding  sixteenth  day  of  March  and  shall  not  become merged or
      consolidated with another corporation taxable under the same part, shall
      make its  return  for  such  period  on  or  before  the  date  of  such
      dissolution,  or  cessation  of  business,  and  every trust company and
      savings bank which shall be dissolved, and shall not  become  merged  or
      consolidated with another corporation taxable under the same part, shall
      make  its  return,  for  the  period  for  which  it  is  taxable  under
      subdivision six of section 11-612 of this subchapter on  or  before  the
      date  of such dissolution. Such return shall be in such form and contain
      such information as the commissioner of  finance  may  require  for  the
      purpose of making any computation or otherwise performing its duty under
      parts  one,  two,  and three of this subchapter. Such return shall state
      specifically the items of gross income derived from  such  business  and
      the  deductions  allowed  by the part for which the return is filed, the
      net income which is the basis of the tax, and the amount of tax due. The
      return shall be subscribed by the president, vice-president,  treasurer,
      assistant  treasurer,  chief  accounting officer or any other officer of
      the taxpayer duly authorized so to act. The fact  that  an  individual's
      name  is  signed  on  the return shall be prima facie evidence that such
      individual is authorized to subscribe and affirm the return on behalf of
      the corporation. Blank  forms  of  return  shall  be  furnished  by  the
      commissioner of finance upon application, but failure to secure the form
      shall  not relieve any taxpayer from the obligation of making any return
      herein required. An automatic extension of three months for  the  filing
      of  its  annual  return shall be allowed for any taxpayer if, within the
      time prescribed herein for the filing thereof, such taxpayer files  with
      the commissioner of finance an application for extension in such form as
      the  commissioner  of finance may prescribe by regulation and pays on or
      before the date of such filing the amount properly estimated as its tax.
      The commissioner of finance may grant a reasonable extension of time for
      filing a return, which may be in addition  to  any  automatic  extension
      allowed  under  the  preceding  sentence, whenever in the commissioner's
      judgment good cause exists  and  shall  keep  a  record  of  every  such
      extension and the reason therefor. No such extension or extensions shall
      aggregate more than three months, exclusive of any automatic extension.
        2.  If  the  amount  of taxable income for any year of any taxpayer as
      returned to the United States treasury department or the New York  state
      tax  department  is changed or corrected by the commissioner of internal
      revenue or other officer of the United States or the New York state  tax
    
      commission  or  other competent authority; or if a taxpayer, pursuant to
      subsection (d) of section sixty-two hundred  thirteen  of  the  internal
      revenue  code,  executes a notice of waiver of the restrictions provided
      in  subsection  (a)  of  such  section,  or  if  a taxpayer, pursuant to
      subdivision (f) of section one  thousand  eighty-one  of  the  tax  law,
      executes  a notice of waiver of the restrictions provided in subdivision
      (c) of such section, such taxpayer shall report such change or corrected
      taxable income or such execution  of  such  notice  of  waiver  and  the
      changes  or  corrections  of  such  taxpayer's federal or New York state
      taxable income on which it is  based,  within  ninety  days  after  such
      execution or the final determination of such change or correction, or as
      required  by the commissioner of finance, and shall concede the accuracy
      of such determination or state wherein it  is  erroneous.  Any  taxpayer
      filing  an  amended  return  with such department shall also file within
      ninety days thereafter  an  amended  return  with  the  commissioner  of
      finance which shall contain such information as it shall require.

Section 11-634 ::    
        
     
        ยง  11-634 Consolidated returns. Corporations which are affiliated may,
      if authorized, and shall, if required, by the commissioner  of  finance,
      under  regulations  prescribed  by  the  commissioner of finance, make a
      consolidated return for the purpose of parts one, two and three of  this
      subchapter.  The  commissioner of finance may, in his or her discretion,
      authorize bank holding companies as defined in article  three-a  of  the
      banking  law  to make a consolidated return with affiliated corporations
      taxable under part one and under part two in which case the consolidated
      tax will be computed in accordance with the provisions of part  one.  In
      all  other  cases  in which a corporation taxable under part two makes a
      consolidated return  with  corporations  taxable  under  part  one,  the
      consolidated  tax  will be computed in accordance with the provisions of
      part one. In any case in which a tax is assessed upon  the  basis  of  a
      consolidated  return,  the  total  tax  shall  be  computed in the first
      instance as a unit and  shall  then  be  assessed  upon  the  respective
      affiliated  corporations in such proportions as may be agreed upon among
      them, or in the absence of any such agreement, then on the basis of  the
      net income properly assignable to each.
    
    
    
    
    
    
    

Section 11-635
--------------

Section 11-635 ::    
        
     
        ยง  11-635  Payment  of tax. Each taxpayer shall, at the time of filing
      its return, pay to the commissioner of finance:
        (a) the amount of tax payable hereunder as the same shall appear  from
      the face of the return, or
        (b)  if  payments  of estimated tax have been made pursuant to section
      11-636 of this part, the balance, if any, of the tax payable  hereunder,
      as  the  same  shall  appear from the face of the return, after applying
      thereto any payments made pursuant to said section.
        If the time for filing the return  shall  be  extended,  the  taxpayer
      shall  pay  in addition interest at the rate of six per centum per annum
      from the time when the return was originally required to be filed to the
      time of payment upon the amount by which the tax, or the portion thereof
      payable when the return was required to be  filed,  exceeds  the  amount
      then paid:
        (1)  a  payment made on or before the date of filing of an application
      for an automatic extension shall be deemed  properly  estimated  if  its
      either:    (A)  not  less  than  ninety per centum of the tax as finally
      determined, or (B) not less than the tax shown on the taxpayer's  return
      for  the  preceding  taxable  year, if such preceding year was a taxable
      year of twelve months; and
        (2) the time when a return is required to be filed shall be determined
      without regard to any extension of time for filing such return.

Section 11-636 ::    
        
     
        ยง  11-636  Declaration  of  estimated  tax;  payments  on  account  of
      estimated tax. 1. Every taxpayer subject to the tax imposed by part  one
      or  two of this subchapter shall make a declaration of the estimated tax
      upon the basis  of  its  net  income  for  the  current  calendar  year,
      containing such information as the commissioner of finance may prescribe
      by  regulations or instructions, if such estimated tax can reasonably be
      expected to exceed one thousand dollars.
        2. The  term  "estimated  tax"  means  the  amount  which  a  taxpayer
      estimates  to  be  the  tax  imposed  upon it by part one or two of this
      subchapter upon the basis of its net income  for  the  current  calendar
      year,  less  the  amount which it estimates to be the sum of any credits
      allowable against the tax.
        3. A declaration of estimated tax shall be filed  on  or  before  June
      fifteenth  of  the calendar year upon the net income of which the tax is
      based, except that if the requirements of subdivision one are first met:
        (a) after June first and before October second of such calendar  year,
      the declaration shall be filed on or before October fifteenth, or
        (b)  after  October first of such calendar year, the declaration shall
      be filed on or before January fifteenth of the succeeding calendar year.
        Notwithstanding  any  other  provision   of   this   subdivision,   no
      declaration  need be filed prior to September eleventh, nineteen hundred
      sixty-six.
        4. A taxpayer  may  amend  a  declaration  under  regulations  of  the
      commissioner of finance.
        5.  If,  on  or  before  February  fifteenth of the succeeding year, a
      taxpayer files its return for the calendar year upon the net  income  of
      which  the  declaration  is required to be based, and pays therewith the
      balance, if any, of the full amount of the tax shown to be  due  on  the
      return,
        (a)  such  return  shall  be  considered  as  its  declaration  if  no
      declaration was required to be filed during such calendar year,  but  is
      otherwise  required  to  be  filed on or before January fifteenth of the
      succeeding year pursuant to subdivision three,
        (b) such return shall be  considered  as  an  amendment  permitted  by
      subdivision  four  to be filed on or before January fifteenth if the tax
      shown on the return is  greater  than  the  estimated  tax  shown  on  a
      declaration previously made.
        6.  The  commissioner  of  finance may grant a reasonable extension of
      time, not to exceed three months, for  the  filing  of  any  declaration
      required  pursuant  to this section, on such terms and conditions as the
      commissioner may require.
        7. Every taxpayer subject to the tax imposed by part  one  or  two  of
      this subchapter shall pay with the return of tax, if any, required to be
      filed  upon the basis of its net income for the preceding calendar year,
      or with an application for extension of the time for filing such return,
      an amount equal to twenty-five per centum of the preceding  year's  tax,
      if such preceding year's tax exceeded one thousand dollars.
        8.  The  estimated  tax  with  respect to which a declaration for such
      calendar year is required pursuant to this  section  shall  be  paid  as
      follows:
        (a)  If  the  declaration  is  filed  on or before June fifteenth, the
      estimated tax shown thereon, after applying thereto the amount  if  any,
      paid  during the same calendar year pursuant to subdivision seven, shall
      be paid in three equal installments. One of such installments  shall  be
      paid  at the time of the filing of the declaration, one shall be paid on
      the following October  fifteenth,  and  one  on  the  following  January
      fifteenth.
    
        (b)  If  the  declaration is filed after June fifteenth, and not after
      October fifteenth of such calendar year, and is not required to be filed
      on or before June fifteenth of such calendar  year,  the  estimated  tax
      shown  on  such  declaration, after applying thereto the amount, if any,
      paid  during the same calendar year pursuant to subdivision seven, shall
      be paid in two equal installments. One of  such  installments  shall  be
      paid  at the time of the filing of the declaration and one shall be paid
      on the following January fifteenth.
        (c) If the declaration  is  filed  after  October  fifteenth  of  such
      calendar  year,  and  is  not  required to be filed on or before October
      fifteenth of such  calendar  year,  the  estimated  tax  shown  on  such
      declaration,  after applying thereto the amount, if any, paid in respect
      of such calendar year pursuant to subdivision seven, shall  be  paid  in
      full at the time of the filing of the declaration.
        (d) If the declaration is filed after the time prescribed therefor, or
      after  the  expiration of any extension of time therefor, paragraphs (b)
      and (c) of this subdivision shall not apply, and there shall be paid  at
      the  time of such filing all installments of estimated tax payable at or
      before such time, and the remaining installments shall be  paid  at  the
      times  at  which,  and  in  the  amounts  in which, they would have been
      payable if the declaration had been filed when due.
        9.  If  any  amendment  of  a  declaration  is  filed,  the  remaining
      installments,  if  any,  shall be ratably increased or decreased (as the
      case may be) to reflect any increase or decrease in the estimated tax by
      reason of such amendment, and if any amendment  is  made  after  October
      fifteenth  of  the  calendar  year, any increase in the estimated tax by
      reason thereof shall be paid at the time of making such amendment.
        10. Any amount paid pursuant to subdivision  seven  shall  be  applied
      after  payment  as  a first installment against the estimated tax of the
      taxpayer shown on the declaration next required to be filed pursuant  to
      this  section  or,  if no declaration of estimated tax is required to be
      filed by the taxpayer pursuant to this section, any such amount shall be
      considered a payment on account of the tax shown on the  return  of  tax
      required  to  be  filed by the taxpayer upon the basis of its net income
      for the calendar year during which such amount was paid.
        11. Notwithstanding the provisions of section 11-679 of  this  chapter
      or  of  section three-a of the general municipal law, if any amount paid
      pursuant to subdivision seven, exceeds  the  tax  shown  on  the  return
      required  to  be  filed by the taxpayer upon the basis of its net income
      for the calendar year during which the amount was paid,  interest  shall
      be  allowed  and paid on the amount by which the amount so paid pursuant
      to such subdivision exceeds such tax, at the rate of six per centum  per
      annum  from  the  date of payment of the amount so paid pursuant to such
      subdivision  to  March  fifteenth  of  the  succeeding  calendar   year,
      provided,  however, that no interest shall be allowed or paid under this
      subdivision if the amount thereof is less than one dollar.
        12. As used in this section, "the preceding year's tax" means the  tax
      imposed upon the taxpayer by part one or two of this subchapter upon the
      basis  of  its  net  income  for  the  preceding  calendar year, or, for
      purposes of computing the first installment of  estimated  tax  when  an
      application  has  been filed for extension of time for filing the return
      required to be filed  for  such  preceding  calendar  year,  the  amount
      properly  estimated  pursuant  to section 11-635 of this part as the tax
      imposed upon the basis of its net income for such calendar year.
        13. This section shall apply to an income period of less  than  twelve
      months in accordance with regulations of the commissioner of finance.
        14.  The  commissioner  of finance may grant a reasonable extension of
      time, not to exceed six  months,  for  payment  of  any  installment  of
    
      estimated  tax  required  pursuant  to  this  section, on such terms and
      conditions as the commissioner may require, including the furnishing  of
      a  bond  or  other  security  by the taxpayer in an amount not exceeding
      twice the amount for which any extension of time for payment is granted,
      provided  however, that interest at the rate of six per centum per annum
      for the period of the extension shall be charged and  collected  on  the
      amount for which any extension of time for payment is granted under this
      subdivision.
        15. A taxpayer may elect to pay any installment of estimated tax prior
      to the date prescribed in this section for payment thereof.
