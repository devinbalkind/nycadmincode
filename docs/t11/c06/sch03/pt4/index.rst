      of  this  subdivision, provided the corporation whose voting stock is so
      owned or controlled is principally engaged in a business, regardless  of
      where  conducted, which (i) might be lawfully conducted by a corporation
      subject to article three of the banking law or  by  a  national  banking

      a  corporation  or association may be created to do under article three,
      three-B, five, five-A, six or ten of the banking  law  or  any  business
      which a corporation or association is authorized by such article to do.

        (g)   Transitional   provisions   relating   to   the   enactment  and
      implementation   of   the   federal   Gramm-Leach-Bliley   act.      (1)
      Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this section other
      than  subdivision  (m)  of  this  section,  a  corporation  that  was in
      existence before January first, two thousand  and  was  subject  to  tax
      under subchapter two of this chapter for its last taxable year beginning
      before  January  first, two thousand, shall continue to be taxable under
      subchapter two for all taxable  years  beginning  on  or  after  January
      first,  two  thousand  and  before  January first, two thousand one. The
      preceding sentence shall not apply to any taxable year during which such
    
      corporation is a banking corporation described in paragraphs one through
      eight of subdivision (a) of this section.  Notwithstanding  anything  to
      the  contrary  contained  in  this section other than subdivision (m) of
      this section, a banking corporation that was in existence before January
      first, two thousand and was subject to tax under this subchapter for its
      last  taxable  year  beginning before January first, two thousand, shall
      continue to be taxable under  this  subchapter  for  all  taxable  years
      beginning  on  or  after  January first, two thousand and before January
      first, two  thousand  one.  Provided,  however,  that  nothing  in  this
      subdivision  shall  prohibit  a  corporation  that  elected  pursuant to
      subdivision (d) of this section to be taxable under  subchapter  two  of
      this  chapter  from  revoking  that  election  in  accordance  with such
      subdivision (d).
        For purposes of this paragraph, a corporation shall be  considered  to
      be  subject  to  tax  under subchapter two of this chapter for a taxable
      year if such corporation was not a taxpayer but was properly included in
      a combined report filed pursuant to subdivision four of  section  11-605
      of  this  chapter  for  such  taxable  year  and  a corporation shall be
      considered to be subject to tax under this subchapter for a taxable year
      if such corporation was not a taxpayer but was properly  included  in  a
      combined  report  filed  pursuant  to  subdivision (f) or (g) of section
      11-646 of this chapter for such taxable year. A corporation that was  in
      existence  before  January  first,  two  thousand  but  first  becomes a
      taxpayer in a taxable year beginning on  or  after  January  first,  two
      thousand and before January first, two thousand one, shall be considered
      for  purposes  of  this  paragraph  to  have  been  subject to tax under
      subchapter two of this chapter  for  its  last  taxable  year  beginning
      before  January  first, two thousand if such corporation would have been
      subject to tax under such subchapter for such taxable  year  if  it  had
      been  a  taxpayer  during  such  taxable year. A corporation that was in
      existence before  January  first,  two  thousand  but  first  becomes  a
      taxpayer  in  a  taxable  year  beginning on or after January first, two
      thousand and before January first, two thousand one, shall be considered
      for purposes of this paragraph to have been subject to  tax  under  this
      subchapter for its last taxable year beginning before January first, two
      thousand  if  such corporation would have been subject to tax under this
      subchapter for such taxable year if it had been a taxpayer  during  such
      taxable year.
        (2) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this section
      other  than  subdivision (m) of this section, a corporation formed on or
      after January first, two thousand and before January first, two thousand
      one may elect to be subject  to  tax  under  this  subchapter  or  under
      subchapter  two  of this chapter for its first taxable year beginning on
      or after January first, two  thousand  and  before  January  first,  two
      thousand  one  in  which  either  (i)  sixty-five percent or more of its
      voting stock is  owned  or  controlled,  directly  or  indirectly  by  a
      financial  holding  company, provided the corporation whose voting stock
      is so owned or controlled is principally engaged in activities that  are
      described  in  section  4(k)(4)  or  4(k)(5) of the federal bank holding
      company  act  of  nineteen  hundred  fifty-six,  as  amended   and   the
      regulations  promulgated  pursuant  to  the authority of such section or
      (ii) it is a financial subsidiary. An election under this paragraph  may
      not  be  made by a corporation described in paragraphs one through eight
      of subdivision (a) of  this  section  or  in  subdivision  (e)  of  this
      section.  In  addition, an election under this paragraph may not be made
      by a corporation that is a party to  a  reorganization,  as  defined  in
      subsection  (a)  of section 368 of the internal revenue code of 1986, as
      amended, of a corporation described in paragraph one of this subdivision
    
      if  both  corporations  were  sixty-five  percent  or  more   owned   or
      controlled,  directly or indirectly by the same interests at the time of
      the reorganization.
        An  election  under  this paragraph must be made by the taxpayer on or
      before the due date for filing its return  (determined  with  regard  to
      extensions  of  time  for  filing)  for the applicable taxable year. The
      election to be taxed under subchapter two of this chapter shall be  made
      by  the  taxpayer  by filing the return required pursuant to subdivision
      one of section 11-605 of this chapter and the election to be taxed under
      this subchapter shall be made by  the  taxpayer  by  filing  the  return
      required  pursuant to subdivision (a) of section 11-646 of this chapter.
      Any election made pursuant to this paragraph two  shall  be  irrevocable
      and  shall  apply  to each subsequent taxable year beginning on or after
      January first, two thousand and before January first, two thousand  one,
      provided that the stock ownership requirements described in subparagraph
      (i)  of  this  paragraph  are  met  or  such  corporation  described  in
      subparagraph (ii) of this paragraph continues as a financial subsidiary.
        (3) For purposes of this  section,  a  financial  subsidiary  means  a
      corporation  (i)  sixty-five  percent  or  more of whose voting stock is
      owned or controlled, directly or indirectly  by  a  banking  corporation

      section and (ii)  is  described  in  section  5136A(g)  of  the  revised
      statutes  of  the  United  States  or  section 46 of the federal deposit
      insurance act. For  purposes  of  this  subchapter,  the  term  "banking
      corporation" shall include a corporation electing to be taxed under this
      subchapter  pursuant to paragraph two of this subdivision for so long as
      such election shall be in effect.
        (4) The provisions of this subdivision shall not apply  to  a  captive
      REIT or a captive RIC.
        (h)   Transitional   provisions   relating   to   the   enactment  and
      implementation   of   the   federal   Gramm-Leach-Bliley   act.      (1)
      Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this section other
      than  subdivision  (m)  of  this  section,  a  corporation  that  was in
      existence before January first, two thousand one and was subject to  tax
      under subchapter two of this chapter for its last taxable year beginning
      before  January  first,  two  thousand one, shall continue to be taxable
      under subchapter two for all taxable years beginning on or after January
      first, two thousand one and before January first,  two  thousand  three.
      The  preceding sentence shall not apply to any taxable year during which
      such corporation is a banking corporation described  in  paragraphs  one
      through  eight  of  subdivision  (a)  of  this  section. Notwithstanding
      anything  to  the  contrary  contained  in  this  section   other   than
      subdivision  (m)  of  this  section,  a  banking corporation that was in
      existence before January first, two thousand one and was subject to  tax
      under this subchapter for its last taxable year beginning before January
      first,  two  thousand  one,  shall  continue  to  be  taxable under this
      subchapter for all taxable years beginning on or  after  January  first,
      two thousand one and before January first, two thousand three. Provided,
      however,  that  nothing in this subdivision shall prohibit a corporation
      that elected pursuant to subdivision (d) of this section to  be  taxable
      under  subchapter  two  of  this  chapter from revoking that election in
      accordance with subdivision (d) of this section.
        For purposes of this paragraph, a corporation shall be  considered  to
      be  subject  to  tax  under subchapter two of this chapter for a taxable
      year if such corporation was not a taxpayer but was properly included in
      a combined report filed pursuant to subdivision four of  section  11-605
      of  this  chapter  for  such  taxable  year  and  a corporation shall be
      considered to be subject to tax under this subchapter for a taxable year
    
      if such corporation was not a taxpayer but was properly  included  in  a
      combined  report  filed  pursuant  to  subdivision (f) or (g) of section
      11-646 of this chapter for such taxable year. A corporation that was  in
      existence  before  January  first,  two thousand one but first becomes a
      taxpayer in a taxable year beginning on  or  after  January  first,  two
      thousand  one  and  before  January  first, two thousand three, shall be
      considered for purposes of this paragraph to have been  subject  to  tax
      under subchapter two of this chapter for its last taxable year beginning

      existence before January first, two thousand one  but  first  becomes  a

      considered  for  purposes  of this paragraph to have been subject to tax
      under this subchapter for its last taxable year beginning before January
      first, two thousand one if such corporation would have been  subject  to
      tax  under  this  subchapter  for  such  taxable  year  if it had been a
      taxpayer during such taxable year.
        (2) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this section
      other than subdivision (m) of this section, a corporation formed  on  or
      after  January  first,  two  thousand  one and before January first, two

      under  subchapter  two  of  this  chapter  for  its  first  taxable year
      beginning on or after January first, two thousand one and before January
      first, two thousand three in which either (i) sixty-five percent or more
      of its voting stock is owned or controlled, directly or indirectly by  a
      financial  holding  company, provided the corporation whose voting stock
      is so owned or controlled is principally engaged in activities that  are
      described  in  section  4(k)(4)  or  4(k)(5) of the federal bank holding
      company  act  of  nineteen  hundred  fifty-six,  as  amended   and   the
      regulations  promulgated  pursuant  to  the authority of such section or
      (ii) it is a financial subsidiary. An election under this paragraph  may
      not  be  made by a corporation described in paragraphs one through eight
      of subdivision (a) of  this  section  or  in  subdivision  (e)  of  this
      section.  In  addition, an election under this paragraph may not be made
      by a corporation that is a party to  a  reorganization,  as  defined  in
      subsection  (a)  of section 368 of the internal revenue code of 1986, as
      amended, of a corporation described in paragraph one of this subdivision
      if  both  corporations  were  sixty-five  percent  or  more   owned   or
      controlled,  directly or indirectly by the same interests at the time of
      the reorganization.
        An election under this paragraph must be made by the  taxpayer  on  or
      before  the  due  date  for filing its return (determined with regard to
      extensions of time for filing) for  the  applicable  taxable  year.  The
      election  to be taxed under subchapter two of this chapter shall be made
      by the taxpayer by filing the return required  pursuant  to  subdivision
      one of section 11-605 of this chapter and the election to be taxed under
      this  subchapter  shall  be  made  by  the taxpayer by filing the return
      required pursuant to subdivision (a) of section 11-646 of this  chapter.
      Any  election  made  pursuant to this paragraph shall be irrevocable and
      shall apply to each  subsequent  taxable  year  beginning  on  or  after
      January  first,  two thousand one and before January first, two thousand
      three, provided that  the  stock  ownership  requirements  described  in
      subparagraph (i) of this paragraph are met or such corporation described
      in  subparagraph  (ii)  of  this  paragraph  continues  as  a  financial
      subsidiary.
    
        (3) For purposes of this  section,  a  financial  subsidiary  means  a
      corporation  (i)  sixty-five  percent  or  more of whose voting stock is
      owned or controlled, directly or indirectly  by  a  banking  corporation
      described  in  paragraph  one,  two  or three of subdivision (a) of this
      section  and  (ii)  is  described  in  section  5136A(g)  of the revised
      statutes of the United States or  section  46  of  the  federal  deposit
      insurance  act.  For  purposes  of  this  subchapter,  the term "banking
      corporation" shall include a corporation electing to be taxed under this
      subchapter pursuant to paragraph two of this subdivision for so long  as
      such election shall be in effect.
        (i)   Transitional   provisions   relating   to   the   enactment  and
      implementation   of   the   federal   Gramm-Leach-Bliley   act.      (1)
      Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this section other
      than  subdivision  (m)  of  this  section,  a  corporation  that  was in
      existence before January first, two thousand three and  was  subject  to
      tax  under  subchapter  two  of  this  chapter for its last taxable year
      beginning before January first, two thousand three, shall continue to be
      taxable under subchapter two for all taxable years beginning on or after
      January first, two thousand three and before January first, two thousand
      four. The preceding sentence shall not apply to any taxable year  during
      which  such corporation is a banking corporation described in paragraphs
      one through eight of subdivision (a) of  this  section.  Notwithstanding
      anything   to   the  contrary  contained  in  this  section  other  than
      subdivision (m) of this section,  a  banking  corporation  that  was  in
      existence  before  January  first, two thousand three and was subject to
      tax under this subchapter for its last  taxable  year  beginning  before
      January  first,  two  thousand three, shall continue to be taxable under
      this subchapter for all taxable years  beginning  on  or  after  January
      first,  two  thousand three and before January first, two thousand four.
      Provided, however, that nothing in this  subdivision  shall  prohibit  a
      corporation  that elected pursuant to subdivision (d) of this section to
      be taxable under subchapter two  of  this  chapter  from  revoking  that
      election in accordance with subdivision (d) of this section.
        For  purposes  of this paragraph, a corporation shall be considered to
      be subject to tax under subchapter two of this  chapter  for  a  taxable
      year if such corporation was not a taxpayer but was properly included in
      a  combined  report filed pursuant to subdivision four of section 11-605
      of this chapter for  such  taxable  year  and  a  corporation  shall  be
      considered to be subject to tax under this subchapter for a taxable year
      if  such  corporation  was not a taxpayer but was properly included in a
      combined report filed pursuant to subdivision  (f)  or  (g)  of  section
      11-646  of this chapter for such taxable year. A corporation that was in
      existence before January first, two thousand three but first  becomes  a
      taxpayer  in  a  taxable  year  beginning on or after January first, two
      thousand three and before January first, two  thousand  four,  shall  be
      considered  for  purposes  of this paragraph to have been subject to tax
      under subchapter two of this chapter for its last taxable year beginning
      before January first, two thousand three if such corporation would  have
      been  subject  to  tax under such subchapter for such taxable year if it
      had been a taxpayer during such taxable year. A corporation that was  in
      existence  before  January first, two thousand three but first becomes a
      taxpayer in a taxable year beginning on  or  after  January  first,  two
      thousand  three  and  before  January first, two thousand four, shall be
      considered for purposes of this paragraph to have been  subject  to  tax
      under this subchapter for its last taxable year beginning before January
      first, two thousand three if such corporation would have been subject to
      tax  under  this  subchapter  for  such  taxable  year  if it had been a
      taxpayer during such taxable year.
    
        (2) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this section
      other than subdivision (m) of this section, a corporation formed  on  or
      after  January  first,  two thousand three and before January first, two
      thousand four may elect to be subject to tax under  this  subchapter  or
      under  subchapter  two  of  this  chapter  for  its  first  taxable year
      beginning on or after January  first,  two  thousand  three  and  before
      January  first, two thousand four in which either (i) sixty-five percent
      or more of  its  voting  stock  is  owned  or  controlled,  directly  or
      indirectly  by  a  financial  holding  company, provided the corporation
      whose voting stock is so owned or controlled is principally  engaged  in
      activities  that  are  described  in  section  4(k)(4) or 4(k)(5) of the
      federal bank holding company  act  of  nineteen  hundred  fifty-six,  as
      amended  and  the  regulations  promulgated pursuant to the authority of
      such section or (ii) it is a financial  subsidiary.  An  election  under
      this  paragraph may not be made by a corporation described in paragraphs
      one through eight of subdivision (a) of this section or  in  subdivision
      (e)  of  this section. In addition, an election under this paragraph may
      not be made by a corporation that is a party  to  a  reorganization,  as
      defined in subsection (a) of section 368 of the internal revenue code of
      1986,  as  amended,  of a corporation described in paragraph one of this
      subdivision if both corporations were sixty-five percent or  more  owned
      or  controlled, directly or indirectly by the same interests at the time
      of the reorganization.
        An election under this paragraph must be made by the  taxpayer  on  or
      before  the  due  date  for filing its return (determined with regard to
      extensions of time for filing) for  the  applicable  taxable  year.  The
      election  to be taxed under subchapter two of this chapter shall be made
      by the taxpayer by filing the return required  pursuant  to  subdivision
      one of section 11-605 of this chapter and the election to be taxed under
      this  subchapter  shall  be  made  by  the taxpayer by filing the return
      required pursuant to subdivision (a) of section 11-646 of this  chapter.
      Any  election  made  pursuant to this paragraph shall be irrevocable and
      shall apply to each  subsequent  taxable  year  beginning  on  or  after
      January first, two thousand three and before January first, two thousand
      four,  provided  that  the  stock  ownership  requirements  described in
      subparagraph (i) of this paragraph are met or such corporation described
      in  subparagraph  (ii)  of  this  paragraph  continues  as  a  financial
      subsidiary.
        (3)  For  purposes  of  this  section,  a financial subsidiary means a
      corporation (i) sixty-five percent or more  of  whose  voting  stock  is
      owned  or  controlled,  directly  or indirectly by a banking corporation
      described in paragraph one, two or three  of  subdivision  (a)  of  this
      section  and  (ii)  is  described  in  section  5136A(g)  of the revised
      statutes of the United States or  section  46  of  the  federal  deposit
      insurance  act.  For  purposes  of  this  subchapter,  the term "banking
      corporation" shall include a corporation electing to be taxed under this
      subchapter pursuant to paragraph two of this subdivision for so long  as
      such election shall be in effect.
        (j)   Transitional   provisions   relating   to   the   enactment  and
      implementation   of   the   federal   Gramm-Leach-Bliley   act.      (1)
      Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this section other
      than  subdivision  (m)  of  this  section,  a  corporation  that  was in
      existence before January first, two thousand four and was subject to tax
      under subchapter two of this chapter for its last taxable year beginning
      before January first, two thousand four, shall continue  to  be  taxable
      under subchapter two for all taxable years beginning on or after January
      first, two thousand four and before January first, two thousand six. The
      preceding sentence shall not apply to any taxable year during which such
    
      corporation is a banking corporation described in paragraphs one through
      eight  of  subdivision  (a) of this section. Notwithstanding anything to
      the contrary contained in this section other  than  subdivision  (m)  of
      this section, a banking corporation that was in existence before January
      first,  two  thousand  four and was subject to tax under this subchapter
      for its last taxable year beginning before January first,  two  thousand
      four, shall continue to be taxable under this subchapter for all taxable
      years  beginning on or after January first, two thousand four and before
      January first, two thousand six. Provided, however, that nothing in this
      subdivision shall  prohibit  a  corporation  that  elected  pursuant  to
      subdivision  (d)  of  this section to be taxable under subchapter two of
      this chapter from revoking that election in accordance with  subdivision
      (d) of this section.
        For  purposes  of this paragraph, a corporation shall be considered to
      be subject to tax under subchapter two of this  chapter  for  a  taxable
      year if such corporation was not a taxpayer but was properly included in
      a  combined  report filed pursuant to subdivision four of section 11-605
      of this chapter for  such  taxable  year  and  a  corporation  shall  be
      considered to be subject to tax under this subchapter for a taxable year
      if  such  corporation  was not a taxpayer but was properly included in a
      combined report filed pursuant to subdivision  (f)  or  (g)  of  section
      11-646  of this chapter for such taxable year. A corporation that was in
      existence before January first, two thousand four but  first  becomes  a
      taxpayer  in  a  taxable  year  beginning on or after January first, two
      thousand four and before January  first,  two  thousand  six,  shall  be
      considered  for  purposes  of this paragraph to have been subject to tax
      under subchapter two of this chapter for its last taxable year beginning
      before January first, two thousand four if such corporation  would  have
      been  subject  to  tax under such subchapter for such taxable year if it
      had been a taxpayer during such taxable year. A corporation that was  in
      existence  before  January  first, two thousand four but first becomes a
      taxpayer in a taxable year beginning on  or  after  January  first,  two
      thousand  four  and  before  January  first,  two thousand six, shall be
      considered for purposes of this paragraph to have been  subject  to  tax
      under this subchapter for its last taxable year beginning before January
      first,  two thousand four if such corporation would have been subject to
      tax under this subchapter for  such  taxable  year  if  it  had  been  a
      taxpayer during such taxable year.
        (2) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this section
      other  than  subdivision (m) of this section, a corporation formed on or
      after January first, two thousand four and  before  January  first,  two
      thousand  six  may  elect  to be subject to tax under this subchapter or
      under subchapter  two  of  this  chapter  for  its  first  taxable  year
      beginning  on  or  after  January  first,  two  thousand four and before
      January first, two thousand six in which either (i)  sixty-five  percent
      or  more  of  its  voting  stock  is  owned  or  controlled, directly or
      indirectly by a financial  holding  company,  provided  the  corporation
      whose  voting  stock is so owned or controlled is principally engaged in
      activities that are described in  section  4(k)(4)  or  4(k)(5)  of  the
      federal  bank  holding  company  act  of  nineteen hundred fifty-six, as
      amended and the regulations promulgated pursuant  to  the  authority  of
      such  section  or  (ii)  it is a financial subsidiary. An election under
      this paragraph may not be made by a corporation described in  paragraphs
      one  through  eight of subdivision (a) of this section or in subdivision
      (e) of this section. In addition, an election under this  paragraph  may

      internal  revenue  code of nineteen hundred eighty-six, as amended, of a
    
      corporation described in paragraph  one  of  this  subdivision  if  both
      corporations  were  sixty-five  percent  or  more  owned  or controlled,

      reorganization.
        An  election  under  this paragraph must be made by the taxpayer on or
      before the due date for filing its return  (determined  with  regard  to
      extensions  of  time  for  filing)  for the applicable taxable year. The

      by  the  taxpayer  by filing the return required pursuant to subdivision
      one of section 11-605 of this chapter and the election to be taxed under
      this subchapter shall be made by  the  taxpayer  by  filing  the  return
      required  pursuant to subdivision (a) of section 11-646 of this chapter.
      Any election made pursuant to this paragraph shall  be  irrevocable  and
      shall  apply  to  each  subsequent  taxable  year  beginning on or after
      January first, two thousand four and before January first, two  thousand
      six,  provided  that  the  stock  ownership  requirements  described  in
      subparagraph (i) of this paragraph are met or such corporation described

      "banking corporation" shall include a corporation electing to  be  taxed
      under  this subchapter pursuant to paragraph two of this subdivision for
      so long as such election shall be in effect.

      than   subdivision  (m)  of  this  section,  a  banking  corporation  or
      corporation that was in existence before  January  first,  two  thousand
      twelve and was subject to tax under this subchapter for its last taxable
      year beginning before January first, two thousand twelve, shall continue
      to  be  taxable under this subchapter for all taxable years beginning on
      or after January first, two thousand twelve and  before  January  first,
      two thousand fifteen only if the corporation is a banking corporation as
      defined  in subdivision (a) of this section or the corporation satisfies
      the requirements for a corporation to elect to  be  taxable  under  this
      subchapter.  Provided  further,  that  nothing in this subdivision shall
      prohibit a corporation that elected pursuant to subdivision (d) of  this
      section to be taxable under subchapter two of this chapter from revoking
      that  election  in  accordance with subdivision (d) of this section. For
      purposes of this paragraph, a corporation  shall  be  considered  to  be
      subject  to  tax under subchapter two of this chapter for a taxable year
      if such corporation was not a taxpayer but was properly  included  in  a
      combined  report filed pursuant to subdivision four of section 11-605 of
      this chapter for such taxable year and a corporation shall be considered
      to be subject to tax under this subchapter for a taxable  year  if  such
      corporation  was  not a taxpayer but was properly included in a combined
      report filed pursuant to subdivision (f) or (g)  of  section  11-646  of
      this  part  for  such  taxable year. A corporation that was in existence
      before January first, two thousand twelve but first becomes  a  taxpayer
      in  a  taxable  year  beginning  on or after January first, two thousand
      twelve  and  before  January  first,  two  thousand  fifteen,  shall  be
      considered  for  purposes  of this paragraph to have been subject to tax
      under subchapter two of this chapter for its last taxable year beginning
      before January first, two thousand twelve if such corporation would have
      been subject to tax under such subchapter for such taxable  year  if  it
      had  been a taxpayer during such taxable year. A corporation that was in
      existence before January first, two thousand twelve but first becomes  a
      taxpayer  in  a  taxable  year  beginning on or after January first, two
      thousand twelve and before January first, two thousand fifteen, shall be
      considered for purposes of this paragraph to have been  subject  to  tax
      under this subchapter for its last taxable year beginning before January
      first,  two  thousand twelve if such corporation would have been subject
    
      to tax under this subchapter for such taxable year  if  it  had  been  a
      taxpayer during such taxable year.
        (2) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this section
      other  than  subdivision (m) of this section, a corporation formed on or
      after January first, two thousand twelve and before January  first,  two
      thousand fifteen may elect to be subject to tax under this subchapter or
      under  subchapter  two  of  this  chapter  for  its  first  taxable year
      beginning on or after January first,  two  thousand  twelve  and  before
      January  first,  two  thousand  fifteen  in  which either (i) sixty-five
      percent or more of its voting stock is owned or controlled, directly  or
      indirectly  by  a  financial  holding  company, provided the corporation
      whose voting stock is so owned or controlled is principally  engaged  in
      activities  that  are  described  in  section  4(k)(4) or 4(k)(5) of the
      federal bank holding company  act  of  nineteen  hundred  fifty-six,  as
      amended  and  the  regulations  promulgated pursuant to the authority of
      such section or (ii) it is a financial  subsidiary.  An  election  under
      this  paragraph may not be made by a corporation described in paragraphs
      one through eight of subdivision (a) of this section or  in  subdivision
      (e)  of  this section. In addition, an election under this paragraph may
      not be made by a corporation that is a party  to  a  reorganization,  as
      defined in subsection (a) of section 368 of the internal revenue code of
      1986,  as  amended,  of a corporation described in paragraph one of this
      subdivision if both corporations were sixty-five percent or  more  owned
      or  controlled, directly or indirectly by the same interests at the time
      of the reorganization.
        An election under this paragraph must be made by the  taxpayer  on  or
      before  the  due  date  for filing its return (determined with regard to
      extensions of time for filing) for  the  applicable  taxable  year.  The
      election  to be taxed under subchapter two of this chapter shall be made
      by the taxpayer by filing the return required  pursuant  to  subdivision
      one of section 11-605 of this chapter and the election to be taxed under
      this  subchapter  shall  be  made  by  the taxpayer by filing the return
      required pursuant to subdivision (a) of section 11-646 of this part. Any
      election made pursuant to this paragraph shall be irrevocable and  shall
      apply  to  each  subsequent  taxable  year beginning on or after January
      first, two thousand  twelve  and  before  January  first,  two  thousand
      fifteen,  provided  that the stock ownership and activities requirements
      described in  subparagraph  (i)  of  this  paragraph  are  met  or  such
      corporation  described  in subparagraph (ii) of this paragraph continues
      as a financial subsidiary.
        (3) For purposes of this  section,  a  financial  subsidiary  means  a
      corporation  (i)  sixty-five  percent  or  more of whose voting stock is
      owned or controlled, directly or indirectly  by  a  banking  corporation
      described  in  paragraph  one,  two  or three of subdivision (a) of this
      section and (ii)  is  described  in  section  5136A(g)  of  the  revised
      statutes  of  the  United  States  or  section 46 of the federal deposit
      insurance act. For  purposes  of  this  subchapter,  the  term  "banking
      corporation" shall include a corporation electing to be taxed under this
      subchapter  pursuant to paragraph two of this subdivision for so long as
      such election shall be in effect.
        (m) (1) Notwithstanding anything in this part to the contrary, if  any
      of the conditions described in paragraph three of this subdivision apply
      to  a  corporation that has made either the election to be taxable under
      subchapter  two  of  chapter  six  of  this  title   pursuant   to   the
      Gramm-Leach-Bliley  transitional  provisions  in  this  section,  or the
      election pursuant to subdivision (d) of this section to continue  to  be
      taxable  under  subchapter two of chapter six of this title (hereinafter
      the "electing corporation"), then such corporation shall  be  deemed  to
    
      have  revoked  the  election  as of the first day of the taxable year in
      which such condition applied.
        (2)  Notwithstanding  anything in this part to the contrary, if any of
      the conditions described in paragraph three of this subdivision apply to
      a corporation required to be taxable under subchapter two of chapter six
      of this title pursuant to the Gramm-Leach-Bliley transitional provisions
      in this section  (hereinafter  the  "grandfathered  corporation"),  such
      corporation,  if  it  is  otherwise described in subdivision (a) of this
      section, shall be taxable under this part as of the  first  day  of  the
      taxable year in which such condition applied.
        (3)  The  provisions  of  paragraph  one  and  paragraph  two  of this
      subdivision shall apply if any of  the  following  conditions  exist  or
      occur  with  respect  to  the  electing corporation or the grandfathered
      corporation in  a  taxable  year  (including  any  short  taxable  year)

        (C) the corporation has no wages or receipts  allocable  to  New  York
      city pursuant to subdivision three of section 11-604 of this chapter, or
      is  otherwise  inactive; provided that this subparagraph shall not apply
      to a corporation which is engaged in the active conduct of  a  trade  or
      business,  or  substantially  all  of  the assets of which are stock and
      securities of corporations which are directly or  indirectly  controlled
      by it and are engaged in the active conduct of a trade or business;
        (D)  sixty-five percent or more of the voting stock of the corporation
      becomes owned or controlled directly by a corporation that acquired  the
      stock  in  a  transaction  (or  series  of  related  transactions)  that
      qualifies as a  purchase  within  the  meaning  of  paragraph  three  of
      subsection  (h)  of  section  three hundred thirty-eight of the internal
      revenue code unless the corporation whose stock  was  acquired  and  the
      corporation   acquiring  the  stock  were,  immediately  prior  to  such
      purchase, members of the same affiliated group (as such term is  defined
      in  section  fifteen  hundred  four of the internal revenue code without
      regard to  the  exclusions  provided  for  in  subsection  (b)  of  such
      section); or
        (E)   the   corporation,   in  a  transaction  or  series  of  related
      transactions, acquires assets, whether  by  contribution,  purchase,  or
      otherwise,  having  an  average  value  (determined  in  accordance with
      subdivision two of section 11-604 of this chapter,  or,  if  greater,  a
      total tax basis, in excess of forty percent of the average value, or, if
      greater,  the  total  tax  basis,  of  all the assets of the corporation
      immediately  prior  to  such  acquisition  and  as  a  result  of   such
      acquisition the corporation is principally engaged in a business that is
      different  from  the  business  immediately  prior  to such acquisition,
      provided that such different business is described in  subparagraph  (i)
      or (ii) of paragraph nine of subdivision (a) of this section.

      obligation does not preclude the taxation of such income by a state,  or

        (f) Provided the  taxpayer  has  not  made  an  election  pursuant  to
      paragraph  two  of subdivision (b) of section 11-642 of this part, there
      shall be allowed as a deduction in determining entire net income, to the
      extent  not  deductible  in  determining  federal  taxable  income,  the
      adjusted  eligible  net  income  of  an  international  banking facility
      determined as follows:
        (1) The eligible net income of an international banking facility shall
      be the amount remaining after subtracting from the eligible gross income
      the applicable expenses.
        (2) Eligible gross income shall be the  gross  income  derived  by  an
      international banking facility from:
        (A)  making,  arranging  for,  placing  or  servicing loans to foreign
      persons, provided, however, that in the case of a foreign  person  which
      is an individual, or which is a foreign branch of a domestic corporation
      (other  than  a  bank),  or  which  is  a foreign corporation or foreign
      partnership which is eighty per centum  or  more  owned  or  controlled,
      either  directly  or  indirectly,  by  one or more domestic corporations
      (other than  banks),  domestic  partnerships  or  resident  individuals,
      substantially  all the proceeds of the loan are intended for use outside
      of the United States;
        (B) making or placing deposits with foreign persons which are banks or
      foreign branches of banks (including  foreign  subsidiaries  or  foreign
      branches   of   the   taxpayer)  or  with  other  international  banking
      facilities; or
        (C) entering into foreign exchange  trading  or  hedging  transactions
      related to any of the transactions described in this paragraph.
        (3)  Applicable  expenses  shall  be  any expenses or other deductions
      attributable, directly or  indirectly,  to  the  eligible  gross  income
      described in paragraph two of this subdivision.
        (4)  Adjusted  eligible  net income shall be determined by subtracting
      from  eligible  net  income  the  ineligible  funding  amount,  and   by
      subtracting from the amount then remaining the floor amount.
        (5)  The  ineligible  funding  amount  shall  be  the  amount, if any,
      determined by  multiplying  eligible  net  income  by  a  fraction,  the
      numerator  of which is the average aggregate amount for the taxable year
      of all liabilities, including deposits, and other sources  of  funds  of
    
      the  international  banking  facility which were not owed to or received
      from foreign persons, and  the  denominator  of  which  is  the  average
      aggregate  amount  for  the  taxable  year of all liabilities, including
      deposits  and  other  sources  of  funds  of  the  international banking
      facility.
        (6) The floor amount shall  be  the  amount,  if  any,  determined  by
      multiplying  the  amount  remaining  after  subtracting  the  ineligible
      funding amount from the eligible net income by a fraction,  not  greater
      than one, which is determined as follows:
        (A) The numerator shall be
        (i)  the  percentage,  as  set  forth  in  subparagraph  (C)  of  this
      paragraph, of the average aggregate amount of the  taxpayer's  loans  to
      foreign  persons  and  deposits  with foreign persons which are banks or
      foreign branches of banks (including  foreign  subsidiaries  or  foreign
      branches of the taxpayer), which loans and deposits were recorded in the
      financial  accounts  of  the  taxpayer  for  its  branches, agencies and
      offices  within  the  state   for   taxable   years   nineteen   hundred
      seventy-five,   nineteen   hundred   seventy-six  and  nineteen  hundred
      seventy-seven, minus
        (ii) the average aggregate amount of such loans and such deposits  for
      the  taxable year of the taxpayer (other than such loans and deposits of
      an international banking facility), provided, however, that in  no  case
      shall  the amount determined in this clause exceed the amount determined
      in clause (i) of this subparagraph; and
        (B) The denominator shall be the average aggregate amount of the loans
      to foreign persons and deposits with foreign persons which are banks  or
      foreign  branches  of  banks  (including foreign subsidiaries or foreign
      branches of the taxpayer), which loans and deposits were recorded in the
      financial accounts of the taxpayer's international banking facility  for
      the taxable year.
        (C)  The percentage shall be one hundred percent for the first taxable
      year in which the taxpayer establishes an international banking facility
      and for the next succeeding four taxable years. The percentage shall  be
      eighty percent for the fifth, sixty percent for the sixth, forty percent
      for  the  seventh,  and  twenty percent for the eighth taxable year next
      succeeding the year such taxpayer establishes such international banking
      facility, and zero in the ninth succeeding year and thereafter.
        (7) In the event adjusted eligible net income is  a  loss,  such  loss
      shall be added to entire net income.
        (8) For purposes of this subdivision, the term "foreign person" means:
        (A) an individual who is not a resident of the United States,
        (B)  a  foreign corporation, a foreign partnership or a foreign trust,
      as defined in section seventy-seven hundred one of the internal  revenue
      code, other than a domestic branch thereof,
        (C)  a  foreign  branch  of  a  domestic  corporation  (including  the
      taxpayer),
        (D) a foreign government or an international organization or an agency
      of either, or
        (E) an international banking facility.
        For purposes of this paragraph, the  terms  "foreign"  and  "domestic"
      shall  have  the  same  meaning  as  set  forth in section seventy-seven
      hundred one of the internal revenue code.
        (g) Entire  net  income  shall  be  computed  without  regard  to  the
      reduction  in  the  basis  of property that is required by section three
      hundred sixty-two of the internal revenue code, because of any amount of
      money or other property received  from  the  federal  deposit  insurance
      corporation  pursuant  to  subsection  (c)  of  section  thirteen of the
      federal deposit insurance act, as amended, or from the  federal  savings
    
      and  loan insurance corporation pursuant to paragraph one, two, three or
      four of subsection (f) of  section  four  hundred  six  of  the  federal
      national housing act, as amended.
        (h)(1)  For  purposes of this subdivision, a "thrift institution" is a
      banking corporation which satisfies the  requirements  of  subparagraphs
      (A) and (B) of this paragraph.
        (A)  Such  banking  corporation  must  be (i) a banking corporation as

      regular  interest in a FASIT, as such term is defined in section 860L of
      the internal revenue code, but only in the proportion which  the  assets
      of  such  REMIC  or  FASIT  consist  of property described in any of the
      preceding clauses of  this  subparagraph,  except  that  if  ninety-five
      percent  or  more  of  the  assets  of  such  REMIC  or FASIT are assets
      described in clauses (i) through (v) of this  subparagraph,  the  entire
      interest  in the REMIC or FASIT shall qualify; (vii) any mortgage-backed
      security which represents ownership of a fractional  undivided  interest

      subdivision  (a)  of  section  11-640  of  this  part  or  a real estate

      census  in  the  most  recent  decennial  census;  and  (xv)   community

      not  been reported or collected by the taxpayer for consideration in the
      taxpayer's community reinvestment act evaluation pursuant to the federal
      community  reinvestment  act   of   1977,   as   amended,   or   section
      twenty-eight-b of the banking law as a mortgage loan described in clause
      (iv)  of this subparagraph or a small business loan, small farm loan, or
      consumer loan, (III) benefits the taxpayer's assessment  area  or  areas
      for  purposes  of  the  federal  community  reinvestment act of 1977, as
      amended or section twenty-eight-b  of  the  banking  law  or  a  broader
      statewide or regional area that includes the taxpayer's assessment area,
      and  (IV)  is  identified  in  the  taxpayer's  books  and  records as a
      community development loan for purposes of  its  community  reinvestment
      act  evaluation  pursuant  to  the federal community reinvestment act of
      1977, as amended or section  twenty-eight-b  of  the  banking  law.  For
      purposes  of  clause (xv) of this subparagraph, a "community development
      investment" is an investment in a security  which  has  as  its  primary
      purpose  community development and which is identified in the taxpayer's
      books and  records  as  a  qualified  investment  for  purposes  of  its
      community  reinvestment act evaluation pursuant to the federal community
      reinvestment act of 1977, as amended or section  twenty-eight-b  of  the

      administration's   development  company  or  small  business  investment
      company programs or have gross annual revenues of one million dollars or
      less;  (IV)  activities  that  revitalize  or  stabilize  low-income  or
      moderate-income census tracts or block numbering areas delineated by the
      United  States bureau of the census in the most recent decennial census;
    
      or (V) activities that seek to prevent defaults and/or  foreclosures  in
      loans included in items (I) and (III) of this sentence.
        (C)  At  the  election  of  the  taxpayer, the percentage specified in
      subparagraph (B) of this paragraph shall be applied on the basis of  the
      average assets outstanding during the taxable year, in lieu of the close
      of  the taxable year. For purposes of clause (iv) of subparagraph (B) of
      this paragraph, if a multifamily structure securing a loan  is  used  in
      part  for  nonresidential  use  purposes,  the  entire  loan is deemed a
      residential real property loan if the planned  residential  use  exceeds
      eighty  percent of the property's planned use (determined as of the time
      the loan is made). Also, for purposes of clause (iv) of subparagraph (B)
      of this paragraph, loans made to finance the acquisition or  development
      of  land  shall  be  deemed  to  be  loans  secured  by  an  interest in
      residential real property if there is a reasonable  assurance  that  the
      property  will become residential real property within a period of three
      years from the date of acquisition of such land; but this sentence shall
      not apply for any taxable year unless, within such  three  year  period,
      such land becomes residential real property. For purposes of determining
      whether  any  interest  in  a  REMIC  qualifies  under  clause  (vi)  of
      subparagraph (B) of this paragraph,  any  regular  interest  in  another
      REMIC  held  by  such  REMIC  shall  be treated as a loan described in a
      preceding clause under principles  similar  to  the  principle  of  such
      clause  (vi); except that if such REMICS are part of a tiered structure,
      they shall be treated as one REMIC for purposes of such clause (vi).
        (2) For taxable years beginning before  January  first,  two  thousand
      ten,  a  thrift  institution  must  exclude  from the computation of its
      entire net income any amount allowed as a deduction for  federal  income
      tax purposes pursuant to section 166, 585 or 593 of the internal revenue
      code.
        (3)  For  taxable  years  beginning before January first, two thousand
      ten, a thrift institution shall be allowed as a deduction  in  computing
      entire net income the amount of a reasonable addition to its reserve for
      bad debts. This amount shall be equal to the sum of
        (A)  the  amount determined to be a reasonable addition to the reserve
      for losses on nonqualifying loans, computed in the  same  manner  as  is
      provided  with  respect to additions to the reserves for losses on loans
      of banks under paragraph one of subdivision (i) of this section, plus
        (B) the amount determined by the taxpayer to be a reasonable  addition
      to  the  reserve  for losses on qualifying real property loans, but such
      amount shall not exceed the amount determined under  paragraph  four  or
      five  of  this  subdivision,  whichever  is  the  larger, but the amount
      determined under this subparagraph shall in no case be greater than  the
      larger of
        (i) the amount determined under paragraph five of this subdivision, or
        (ii)  the  amount  which,  when  added  to the amount determined under
      subparagraph (A) of this paragraph, equals the amount  by  which  twelve
      percent  of the total deposits or withdrawable accounts of depositors of
      the taxpayer at the close of such year exceeds the sum of  its  surplus,
      undivided  profits  and  reserves  at the beginning of such year (taking
      into account any portion thereof attributable to the period  before  the
      first  taxable  year  beginning  after  December  thirty-first, nineteen
      hundred fifty-one).
        The  taxpayer  must  include  in  its  tax  return  for  each  year  a
      computation  of  the  amount  of  the  addition  to the bad debt reserve
      determined under this subdivision. The use of a particular method in the
      return for a taxable year is not a binding election by the taxpayer.
        (4)(A) Subject to subparagraphs (B) and (C)  of  this  paragraph,  the
      amount  determined under this paragraph for the taxable year shall be an
    
      amount equal to thirty-two percent of the entire  net  income  for  such
      year.
        (B)  The  amount  determined  under subparagraph (A) of this paragraph
      shall be reduced (but not below zero) by  the  amount  determined  under
      subparagraph (A) of paragraph three of this subdivision.
        (C)  The  amount  determined under this paragraph shall not exceed the
      amount necessary to increase the balance at the  close  of  the  taxable
      year  of the reserve for losses on qualifying real property loans to six
      percent of such loans outstanding at such time.
        (D) For purposes  of  this  paragraph,  entire  net  income  shall  be
      computed
        (i)  by excluding from income any amount included therein by reason of
      subparagraph (B) of paragraph eight of this subdivision,
        (ii) without regard to any deduction allowable for any addition to the
      reserve for bad debts, and
        (iii) by excluding from income an amount equal to the net gain for the
      taxable year arising from the sale or exchange of stock of a corporation
      or of obligations the interest on which is excludable from gross  income
      under section 103 of the internal revenue code.
        (iv)  Whenever  a  thrift  institution  is  properly  includable  in a
      combined return, entire net income,  for  purposes  of  this  paragraph,
      shall  not  exceed  the  lesser  of  the thrift institution's separately
      computed entire net income as adjusted pursuant to clauses  (i)  through
      (iii)  of this subparagraph or the combined group's entire net income as
      adjusted pursuant to clauses (i) through (iii) of this subparagraph.
        (5) The amount determined under this paragraph for  the  taxable  year
      shall  be computed in the same manner as is provided under paragraph one
      of subdivision (i) of this section with respect to additions to reserves
      for losses on loans of banks. Provided, however, that  for  any  taxable
      year  beginning after nineteen hundred ninety-five, for purposes of such
      computation, the base year shall be the later of (A)  the  last  taxable
      year  beginning  in nineteen hundred ninety-five or (B) the last taxable
      year before the current year in which the amount  determined  under  the
      provisions  of  subparagraph  (B) of paragraph three of this subdivision
      exceeded the amount allowable under this paragraph.
        (6)  (A)  (i)  Each  taxpayer  described  in  paragraph  one  of  this
      subdivision  shall  establish and maintain a New York reserve for losses
      on qualifying real property loans, a New  York  reserve  for  losses  on
      nonqualifying loans and a supplemental reserve for losses on loans. Such
      reserves  shall be maintained for all subsequent taxable years that this
      subdivision applies to the taxpayer.
        (ii) For purposes of this subdivision, such reserves shall be  treated
      as  reserves  for  bad  debts, but no deduction shall be allowed for any
      addition to the supplemental reserve for losses on loans.
        (iii) Except as noted below, the balances of each such reserve at  the
      beginning  of  the  first  day of the first taxable year beginning after
      December thirty-first, nineteen hundred ninety-five shall be the same as
      the balances maintained for federal income tax  purposes  in  accordance
      with  section  593(c)(1) of the internal revenue code as in existence on
      December thirty-first, nineteen hundred ninety-five for the last day  of
      the  last  tax  year  beginning  before  January first, nineteen hundred
      ninety-six. A taxpayer which maintained a  New  York  reserve  for  loan
      losses  on qualifying real property loans in the last tax year beginning
      before  January  first,  nineteen  hundred  ninety-six  shall   have   a
      continuation  of  such  New  York  reserve balance in lieu of the amount
      determined under the preceding sentence.
        (iv) Notwithstanding clause (ii)  of  this  subparagraph,  any  amount
      allocated  to  the  reserve for losses on qualifying real property loans
    
      pursuant to section 593(c)(5) of the internal revenue code as in  effect
      immediately  prior  to the enactment of the Tax Reform Act of 1976 shall
      not be treated as a reserve for bad debts for  any  purpose  other  than
      determining  the  amount  referred  to  in subparagraph (B) of paragraph
      three of this subdivision, and for such purpose  such  amount  shall  be
      treated as remaining in such reserve.
        (B) Any debt becoming worthless or partially worthless in respect of a
      qualifying real property loan shall be charged to the reserve for losses
      on  such loans and any debt becoming worthless or partially worthless in
      respect of a nonqualifying loan shall be  charged  to  the  reserve  for
      losses  on  nonqualifying  loans,  except that any such debt may, at the
      election of the taxpayer,  be  charged  in  whole  or  in  part  to  the
      supplemental reserve for losses on loans.
        (C)  The New York reserve for losses on qualifying real property loans
      shall be increased by the amount determined under  subparagraph  (B)  of
      paragraph  three of this subdivision and the New York reserve for losses
      on nonqualifying loans shall be increased by the amount determined under
      subparagraph (A) of paragraph three of this subdivision.
        (7)(A) For purposes of this subdivision,  the  term  "qualifying  real
      property  loan"  shall  mean any loan secured by an interest in improved
      real property or secured by an interest in real property which is to  be
      improved  out  of  the proceeds of the loan. Such term shall include any
      mortgage-backed security which  represents  ownership  of  a  fractional
      undivided  interest in a trust, the assets of which consist primarily of
      mortgage loans, provided that the real property which serves as security
      for the loans is (or from the proceeds of the  loan,  will  become)  the
      type  of  property  described in clauses (i) through (v) of subparagraph
      (B) of paragraph one of this subdivision. However, such term  shall  not
      include:  (i)  any  loan  evidenced by a security (as defined in section
      165(g)(2)(C) of the internal revenue code); (ii) any  loan,  whether  or
      not  evidenced  by a security (as defined in such section 165(g)(2)(C)),
      the  primary  obligor  of  which  is  (I)  a  government  or   political
      subdivision  or  instrumentality thereof, (II) a banking corporation, or
      (III) any corporation sixty-five percent or more of whose  voting  stock
      is  owned or controlled, directly or indirectly, by the taxpayer or by a
      banking corporation or bank  holding  company  that  owns  or  controls,
      directly  or  indirectly, sixty-five percent or more of the voting stock
      of the taxpayer; (iii) any loan, to the extent secured by a  deposit  in
      or  share  of  the  taxpayer; or (iv) any loan which, within a sixty-day
      period beginning in one taxable year of the creditor and ending  in  its
      next  taxable  year, is made or acquired and then repaid or disposed of,
      unless the transactions by which such loan was made or acquired and then
      repaid or disposed of are established  to  be  for  bona  fide  business
      purposes.
        (B)  For  purposes  of this subdivision, the term "nonqualifying loan"
      shall mean any loan which is not a qualifying real property loan.
        (C) For purposes of this subdivision, the term "loan" shall mean debt,
      as the term "debt" is used in section 166 of the internal revenue code.
        (D) A regular or residual interest in a REMIC, as such term is defined
      in section 860D of the internal revenue code,  shall  be  treated  as  a
      qualifying  real  property  loan,  except that, if less than ninety-five
      percent of the assets of such REMIC are qualifying real  property  loans
      (determined  as  if  the  taxpayer  held  the assets of the REMIC), such
      interest shall be so treated only in the proportion which the assets  of
      such  REMIC  consist  of such loans. For purposes of determining whether
      any interest in a REMIC qualifies  under  the  preceding  sentence,  any
      interest  in  another  REMIC  held  by  such REMIC shall be treated as a
      qualifying real property loan under principles similar to the principles
    
      of the preceding sentence, except that if such  REMICS  are  part  of  a
      tiered  structure,  they  shall  be treated as one REMIC for purposes of
      this paragraph.
        (8)(A)  Any  distribution of property (as defined in section 317(a) of
      the internal revenue code) by a thrift institution to a shareholder with
      respect to its stock,  if  such  distribution  is  not  allowable  as  a
      deduction under section 591 of such code, shall be treated as made
        (i)  first  out  of  its  New York earnings and profits accumulated in
      taxable years beginning after December  thirty-first,  nineteen  hundred
      fifty-one, to the extent thereof,
        (ii)  then  out  of the New York reserve for losses on qualifying real
      property loans, to the extent  additions  to  such  reserve  exceed  the
      additions  which  would  have  been allowed under paragraph five of this
      subdivision,
        (iii) then out of the supplemental reserve for losses on loans, to the
      extent thereof,
        (iv) then out of such other accounts as may be proper.
      This subparagraph shall  apply  in  the  case  of  any  distribution  in
      redemption  of  stock  or in partial or complete liquidation of a thrift
      institution, except that any such distribution shall be treated as  made
      first out of the amount referred to in clause (ii) of this subparagraph,
      second   out  of  the  amount  referred  to  in  clause  (iii)  of  this
      subparagraph, third out of the amount referred to in clause (i) of  this
      subparagraph  and then out of such other accounts as may be proper. This
      subparagraph shall not apply to any transaction to which section 381  of
      such  code  (relating  to carryovers and certain corporate acquisitions)
      applies, or  to  any  distribution  to  the  federal  savings  and  loan
      insurance  corporation  or  the federal deposit insurance corporation in
      redemption of an interest in an  association  or  institution,  if  such
      interest  was  originally  received  by  the  federal  savings  and loan
      insurance corporation or the federal deposit  insurance  corporation  in
      exchange  for  financial  assistance  pursuant  to section 406(f) of the
      federal national housing act or pursuant to subsection  (c)  of  section
      thirteen of the federal deposit insurance act.
        (B)  If  any  distribution  is  treated under subparagraph (A) of this
      paragraph as having been made out of the reserves described  in  clauses
      (ii)  and  (iii)  of  such subparagraph, the amount charged against such
      reserve shall be the amount which, when reduced by  the  amount  of  tax
      imposed  under  the  internal  revenue  code  and  attributable  to  the
      inclusion of such amount in gross income, is equal to the amount of such
      distribution; and the amount so charged against such  reserve  shall  be
      included in the entire net income of the taxpayer.
        (C)  (i)  For  purposes  of  clause  (ii)  of subparagraph (A) of this
      paragraph, additions to the New York reserve for  losses  on  qualifying
      real  property  loans  for  the  taxable  year in which the distribution
      occurs shall be taken into account.
        (ii) For purposes of computing under this subdivision the amount of  a
      reasonable  addition  to  the  New York reserve for losses on qualifying
      real property loans for any taxable year, the amount charged during  any
      year  to  such reserve pursuant to the provisions of subparagraph (B) of
      this paragraph shall not be taken into account.
        (9) A taxpayer which maintains  a  New  York  reserve  for  losses  on
      qualifying  real  property loans and which ceases to meet the definition
      of a thrift institution as defined in paragraph one of this subdivision,
      must include in its entire net income for the  last  taxable  year  such
      paragraph  applied  the  excess  of  its  New York reserve for losses on
      qualifying real property loans over the greater of (A) its  reserve  for
      losses  on qualifying real property loans as of the last day of the last
    
      taxable year such reserve is maintained for federal income tax  purposes
      or (B) the balance of the New York reserve for losses on qualifying real
      property  loans  which  would  be allowable to the taxpayer for the last
      taxable  year  such taxpayer met such definition of a thrift institution
      if the taxpayer had computed its reserve balance pursuant to the  method
      described  in  subparagraph  (A)  of paragraph one of subdivision (i) of
      this section.
        (i) (1) For taxable years beginning before January first, two thousand
      ten, a taxpayer subject to the  provisions  of  section  585(c)  of  the
      internal revenue code and not subject to subdivision (h) of this section
      may,  in  computing entire net income, deduct an amount equal to or less
      than  the  amount  determined  pursuant  to  subparagraph  (A)  of  this
      paragraph  or  subparagraph (B) of this paragraph, whichever is greater.
      Provided, however, in no event shall the  deduction  be  less  than  the
      amount determined pursuant to such subparagraph (A).
        (A)  The  amount determined pursuant to this subparagraph shall be the
      amount necessary to increase the balance of its  New  York  reserve  for
      losses  on  loans (at the close of the taxable year) to the amount which
      bears the same ratio to loans outstanding at the close  of  the  taxable
      year  as  (i)  the total bad debts sustained during the taxable year and
      the  five  preceding  taxable  years  (or,  with  the  approval  of  the
      commissioner  of  finance, a shorter period), adjusted for recoveries of
      bad debts during such period,  bears  to  (ii)  the  sum  of  the  loans
      outstanding at the close of such six or fewer taxable years.
        (B)(i)  The  amount  determined pursuant to this subparagraph shall be
      the amount necessary to increase the balance of its New York reserve for
      losses on loans (at the close of the taxable year) to the lower of --
        (I) the balance of the reserve at the close of the base year, or
        (II) if the amount of loans outstanding at the close  of  the  taxable
      year  is  less  than the amount of loans outstanding at the close of the
      base year, the amount which bears the same ratio to loans outstanding at
      the close of the taxable year as the balance of the reserve at the close
      of the base year bears to the amount of loans outstanding at  the  close
      of the base year.
        (ii)  For  purposes  of this paragraph, the base year shall be (I) for
      taxable years beginning  in  nineteen  hundred  eighty-seven,  the  last
      taxable  year  before  the most recent adoption of the experience method
      for federal income tax purposes or for purposes of this part,  whichever
      is  earlier, and (II) for taxable years beginning after nineteen hundred
      eighty-seven, the last taxable year beginning  before  nineteen  hundred
      eighty-eight.
        (2) (A) For taxable years beginning before January first, two thousand
      ten,  each taxpayer described in paragraph one of this subdivision shall
      establish and maintain a New York reserve  for  losses  on  loans.  Such
      reserve  shall  be  maintained  for  all  subsequent  taxable years. The
      balance of the New York reserve for losses on loans at the beginning  of
      the  first day of the first taxable year the taxpayer becomes subject to
      this subdivision shall be the same as the balance at  the  beginning  of
      such  day  of  the  reserve  for  losses on loans maintained for federal
      income tax purposes. The New York reserve for losses on loans  shall  be
      reduced  by  an amount equal to the deduction allowed, but not more than
      the amount  allowable,  for  worthless  debts  for  federal  income  tax
      purposes  pursuant  to section 166 of the internal revenue code plus the
      amount, if any, charged against its reserve for losses on loans pursuant
      to section 585(c)(4) of such code.
        (B) For purposes of subparagraph (A) of  this  paragraph,  a  taxpayer
      which  had  previously been subject to the provisions of subdivision (h)
      of this section shall establish a New York reserve for losses  on  loans
    
      equal  to  the  sum of (i) the greater of (I) the balance of its federal
      reserve for losses on qualifying real property loans as of the first day
      of the first taxable year the taxpayer becomes subject to the provisions
      of  this subdivision or (II) the greater of the amounts determined under
      subparagraphs (A) and (B) of paragraph nine of subdivision (h)  of  this
      section  in  the  year  such paragraph applied to the taxpayer, (ii) the
      greater of (I)  the  balance  in  its  federal  reserve  for  losses  on
      nonqualifying  loans  as  of the first day of the first taxable year the
      taxpayer becomes subject to this subdivision or (II) the balance in  its
      New  York  reserve for losses on nonqualifying loans as of the last date
      the taxpayer was subject to the provisions of subdivision  (h)  of  this
      section, and (iii) the balance in its supplemental reserve for losses on
      loans  as of the last date the taxpayer was subject to the provisions of
      subdivision (h) of this section.
        (3) The determination and treatment of the New York  reserve  balance,
      including  any  additions  thereto, subtractions therefrom, or recapture
      thereof, for
        (A) any banking corporation which  was  subject  to  tax  for  federal
      income  tax  purposes  but  not subject to tax under this part for prior
      taxable years,
        (B) any taxpayer which ceases to be subject to tax under this part, or
        (C) any other unusual circumstances
        shall be determined by the commissioner of finance. Provided, however,
      any banking corporation which was subject to tax for federal income  tax
      purposes  but not subject to tax under this part for prior taxable years
      shall have as its opening New York  reserve  for  losses  on  loans  the
      amount  determined  by  applying  the  provisions of subparagraph (A) of
      paragraph one of this subdivision to loans outstanding at the  close  of
      its  last  taxable  year for federal income tax purposes ending prior to
      the first taxable year for which the taxpayer is subject  to  tax  under
      this part and provided, further, that the provisions of subparagraph (B)
      of paragraph one of this subdivision shall not apply.
        (j)   (1)   For   any  taxable  year  beginning  in  nineteen  hundred
      seventy-three or for any  period  for  which  a  tax  is  imposed  under
      subdivision  (b) of section 11-639 of this part, entire net income shall
      be computed without regard to the amount allowable as  a  deduction  for
      bad debts or an addition to a reserve for bad debts in computing federal
      taxable  income  for the taxable year, but, in lieu thereof, a deduction
      shall be  allowed  to  the  extent  and  in  the  manner  authorized  by
      subdivision  five of section 11-621 or subdivision (e) of section 11-629
      of this subchapter as if such provisions were set forth in full in  this
      part and by treating such provisions as applicable under this part.
        (2)  In the case of property placed in service prior to January first,
      nineteen hundred seventy-three, for which the taxpayer properly  adopted
      a  different  method  of  computing depreciation under section 11-621 or
      section 11-629 of this subchapter than was adopted  for  federal  income
      tax purposes with respect to such property, entire net income under this
      part  shall  be  computed  without  regard  to the amount allowable as a
      deduction for depreciation of such property in computing federal taxable
      income for the taxable year but, in lieu thereof, shall be  computed  as
      if  such deduction were determined by the method of depreciation adopted
      with respect to such property under section 11-621  or  11-629  of  this
      subchapter.
        (3)  In  computing  entire  net  income,  the  amount  allowable  as a
      deduction for charitable contributions for federal income  tax  purposes
      shall  be:  (a) increased for the first taxable year or period beginning
      in nineteen hundred seventy-three by the  amount  of  any  contributions
      made  during  such  taxable year or period which were not allowable as a
    
      deduction for charitable contributions for federal income  tax  purposes
      for  such  taxable  year  or  period  because of an election pursuant to
      paragraph two of subsection (a) of section one hundred  seventy  of  the
      internal revenue code and which were not deductible in computing the tax
      due under part one or two of this subchapter three, and (b) decreased by
      any  amount  allowed  as a deduction for federal income tax purposes for
      the taxable year under section  one  hundred  seventy  of  the  internal
      revenue  code  as a carryover of excess contributions which are not made
      in such taxable year and which were deductible in computing the tax  due
      under part one or two of this subchapter three.
        (4)  There shall be excluded from the computation of entire net income
      any amount allowed as a deduction for federal income  tax  purposes  for
      the  taxable  year  under  section twelve hundred twelve of the internal
      revenue code as a capital loss carry forward to the taxable year,  which
      was  deductible as a loss in computing the tax due under part one or two
      of this subchapter three.
        (5) There shall be excluded from the computation of entire net  income
      the  amount  of  any  income  or  gain from the sale of real or personal
      property which is includible in determining federal taxable  income  for
      the  taxable  year pursuant to the installment method under section four
      hundred fifty-three of the internal revenue code,  to  the  extent  that
      such  income  or  gain  was includible in the computation of the tax due
      under part one or two of this subchapter three.
        (6) To the extent not otherwise provided in this part, there shall  be
      excluded  from  entire  net  income  the amount necessary to prevent the
      taxation under this part of any other amount of income or gain which was
      properly included in income or gain and was taxable under  part  one  or
      two  of  this  subchapter  three  and  there  shall  be  disallowed as a
      deduction in computing entire net income any amount which was allowed as
      a deduction in computing the tax due under such parts.
        (k) (1) At the election of the taxpayer, there shall be deducted  from
      the  portion  of  its  entire  net  income  allocated  within  the city,
      depreciation with respect to any property such as described in paragraph
      two of this subdivision, not exceeding twice  the  depreciation  allowed
      with  respect to the same property for federal income tax purposes. Such
      deduction shall be allowed only upon condition that entire net income be
      computed without any deduction for depreciation or amortization  of  the
      same  property,  and the total of all deductions allowed under parts one
      and two of this subchapter three and this part in any  taxable  year  or
      years  with  respect  to  the depreciaton of any such property shall not
      exceed its cost or other basis.
        (2) Such deduction shall be allowed  only  with  respect  to  tangible
      property   which   is   depreciable  pursuant  to  section  one  hundred
      sixty-seven of the internal revenue code, having a situs  in  this  city
      and  used  in the taxpayer's business, (i) constructed, reconstructed or
      erected  after  December  thirty-first,  nineteen  hundred   sixty-five,
      pursuant  to  a  contract which was, on or before December thirty-first,
      nineteen hundred sixty-seven, and at all times  thereafter,  binding  on
      the  taxpayer or, property, the physical construction, reconstruction or
      erection of which began on or  before  December  thirty-first,  nineteen
      hundred  sixty-seven or which began after such date pursuant to an order
      placed on or before December thirty-first, nineteen hundred sixty-seven,
      and then only with respect to that portion of the basis thereof which is
      properly attributable to such construction, reconstruction  or  erection
      after  December  thirty-first,  nineteen  hundred  sixty-five,  or  (ii)
      acquired  after  December  thirty-first,  nineteen  hundred  sixty-five,
      pursuant  to  a  contract which was, on or before December thirty-first,
      nineteen hundred sixty-seven, and at all times  thereafter,  binding  on
    
      the  taxpayer  or  pursuant  to  an  order  placed on or before December
      thirty-first, nineteen hundred sixty-seven, by purchase  as  defined  in
      section  one  hundred  seventy-nine (d) of the internal revenue code, if
      the original use of such property commenced with the taxpayer, commenced
      in this city and commenced after December thirty-first, nineteen hundred
      sixty-five,  or  (iii)  acquired, constructed, reconstructed, or erected
      subsequent to December thirty-first, nineteen  hundred  sixty-seven,  if
      such  acquisition,  construction, reconstruction or erection is pursuant
      to a plan of the taxpayer which was in existence December  thirty-first,
      nineteen  hundred sixty-seven and not thereafter substantially modified,
      and such acquisition, construction,  reconstruction  or  erection  would
      qualify under the rules in paragraph four, five or six of subsection (h)
      of  section  forty-eight  of  the  internal  revenue  code  provided all
      references in such paragraphs four, five and six to  the  dates  October
      nine,  nineteen  hundred  sixty-six,  and  October ten, nineteen hundred
      sixty-six, shall be read  as  December  thirty-first,  nineteen  hundred
      sixty-seven.  A  taxpayer shall be allowed a deduction under clause (i),
      (ii) or (iii) of this paragraph only if the tangible property  shall  be
      delivered  or  the  construction,  reconstruction  or  erection shall be
      completed  on  or  before  December   thirty-first,   nineteen   hundred
      sixty-nine,  except  in the case of tangible property which is acquired,
      constructed, reconstructed or erected pursuant to a contract which  was,
      on or before December thirty-first, nineteen hundred sixty-seven, and at
      all  times  thereafter,  binding on the taxpayer. Provided, however, for
      any taxable year beginning on or after January first,  nineteen  hundred
      sixty-eight, a taxpayer shall not be allowed a deduction under paragraph
      one  hereof  with  respect to tangible personal property leased by it to
      any other person or corporation. For purposes of the preceding sentence,
      any contract or agreement to lease or rent or for a license to use  such
      property shall be considered a lease. With respect to property which the
      taxpayer  uses  itself  for  purposes  other  than leasing for part of a
      taxable year and leases for a part of a taxable year, the taxpayer shall
      be allowed a deduction under paragraph one in proportion to the part  of
      the year it uses such property.
        (3)  If  the deduction allowable for any taxable year pursuant to this
      subdivision exceeds the portion of  the  taxpayer's  entire  net  income
      allocated  to this city for such year, the excess may be carried over to
      the following taxable year or years and may be deducted from the portion
      of the taxpayer's entire net income allocated to this city for such year
      or years.
        (4) In any taxable year when property is sold  or  otherwise  disposed
      of,  with respect to which a deduction has been allowed pursuant to this
      subdivision, subdivision twelve of section 11-621 or subdivision (j)  of
      section  11-629  of  this subchapter, the gain or loss entering into the
      computation of federal taxable income shall be disregarded in  computing
      entire  net  income,  and  there  shall  be added or subtracted from the
      portion of entire net income allocated within the city the gain or  loss
      upon  such sale or other disposition. In computing such gain or loss the
      basis of the property sold or disposed of shall be adjusted  to  reflect
      the  deduction  allowed  with  respect  to  such  property  pursuant  to
      paragraph one of this subdivision. Provided, however, that no loss shall
      be recognized for the purposes of this paragraph with respect to a  sale
      or  other  disposition of property to a person whose acquisition thereof
      is not a purchase as defined in section one hundred seventy-nine (d)  of
      the internal revenue code.
        (k-1)  A  net operating loss deduction shall be allowed which shall be
      presumably the same as the net operating loss  deduction  allowed  under
      section  one  hundred  seventy-two  of the internal revenue code, except
    
      that in every instance  where  such  deduction  is  allowed  under  this
      subchapter:
        (1)  any  net  operating  loss  included in determining such deduction
      shall be adjusted to reflect the inclusions and exclusions  from  entire
      net income required by the other provisions of this section;
        (2)  such deduction shall not include any net operating loss sustained
      during any taxable year beginning prior to January first,  two  thousand
      nine,  or  during any taxable year in which the taxpayer was not subject
      to the tax imposed by this subchapter;
        (3) such deduction shall not exceed the deduction for the taxable year
      allowed under section one hundred seventy-two of  the  internal  revenue
      code  augmented  by  the  excess  of  the  amount allowed as a deduction
      pursuant to subdivision  (h)  or  (i)  of  this  section,  whichever  is
      applicable,  over  the amount allowed as a deduction pursuant to section
      one hundred sixty-six  or  five  hundred  eighty-five  of  the  internal
      revenue  code,  for  each  taxable  year in which the taxpayer had a net
      operating loss which is carried to the taxable  year  of  the  deduction
      under  this  provision,  in  the  aggregate,  (except to the extent such
      excess was previously deducted in computing entire net income); and
        (4) the net operating loss deduction allowed under section one hundred
      seventy-two of the internal revenue code  shall  for  purposes  of  this
      subdivision  be  determined  as  if  the taxpayer had elected under such
      section to relinquish the entire carryback period with  respect  to  net
      operating losses.
        (l)  If  the  period covered by a return under this part is other than
      the  period  covered  by  the  return  to  the  United  States  treasury
      department, entire net income and alternative entire net income shall be
      determined by multiplying the taxable income reported to such department
      (as  adjusted  pursuant to the provisions of this part) by the number of
      calendar months or major parts thereof covered by the return under  this
      part  and  dividing  by  the  number  of  calendar months or major parts
      thereof covered by the return to such department.  If  it  shall  appear
      that  such method of determining entire net income or alternative entire
      net income does not properly reflect the taxpayer's  income  during  the
      period  covered  by  the  return  under  this  part, the commissioner of
      finance shall be authorized in his or her discretion to  determine  such
      entire  net  income or alternative entire net income solely on the basis
      of the taxpayer's income during the period covered by its  return  under
      this part.
        (m)  The  commissioner  of  finance,  may, whenever necessary in order
      properly to reflect the entire net income of any taxpayer, determine the
      year or period in which  any  item  of  income  or  deduction  shall  be
      included,  without  regard  to  the method of accounting employed by the
      taxpayer.
        * (n) Notwithstanding any other  provision  of  this  subchapter,  for
      taxable  years  beginning on or after August first, two thousand two, in
      the case of a taxpayer that is a partner in a partnership subject to the
      tax imposed by chapter eleven of this title as a utility, as defined  in
      subdivision  six  of  section 11-1101 of such chapter, entire net income
      shall not include the taxpayer's distributive  or  pro  rata  share  for
      federal  income  tax  purposes  of  any  item  of  income, gain, loss or
      deduction of such partnership, or any item  of  income,  gain,  loss  or
      deduction of such partnership that the taxpayer is required to take into
      account separately for federal income tax purposes.
        * NB There are 2 sub (n)'s
        * (n)  for  taxable  years  ending after September tenth, two thousand
      one, in the case of qualified property described  in  paragraph  two  of
      subsection  k of section one hundred sixty-eight of the internal revenue
    
      code,  other  than  qualified  resurgence  zone  property  described  in
      subdivision  (p)  of  this  section,  and  other than qualified New York
      Liberty Zone property described in paragraph  two  of  subsection  b  of
      section  fourteen hundred L of the internal revenue code (without regard
      to clause (i) of subparagraph (C) of such paragraph), a  taxpayer  shall
      be  allowed  with  respect  to  such property the depreciation deduction
      allowable under section one hundred sixty-seven as  such  section  would
      have  applied  to  such property had it been acquired by the taxpayer on
      September tenth, two thousand one, provided, however, that  for  taxable
      years  beginning  on  or  after January first, two thousand four, in the
      case of a passenger motor vehicle or a sport utility vehicle subject  to
      the  provisions of subdivision (r) of this section, the limitation under
      clause (i) of subparagraph (A) of paragraph one of  subdivision  (a)  of
      section  two hundred eighty F of the internal revenue code applicable to
      the amount  allowed  as  a  deduction  under  this  paragraph  shall  be
      determined  as of the date such vehicle was placed in service and not as
      of September tenth, two thousand one.
        * NB There are 2 sub (n)'s
        (o) for taxable years ending after September tenth, two thousand  one,
      upon  the  disposition  of  property  to  which  subdivision (n) of this
      section applies, the amount of any gain or loss includible in entire net
      income shall be adjusted to reflect the inclusions and  exclusions  from
      entire  net income pursuant to paragraph thirteen of subdivision (b) and
      subdivision (n) of this section attributable to such property.
        (p) for  purposes  of  subdivisions  (n)  and  (o)  of  this  section,
      qualified   resurgence  zone  property  shall  mean  qualified  property
      described in paragraph two  of  subsection  k  of  section  one  hundred
      sixty-eight of the internal revenue code substantially all of the use of
      which  is in the resurgence zone, as defined below, and is in the active
      conduct of a trade or business by the taxpayer in  such  zone,  and  the
      original use of which in the resurgence zone commences with the taxpayer
      after  September tenth, two thousand one. The resurgence zone shall mean
      the area of New York county bounded on the south by a line running  from
      the  intersection  of  the  Hudson  River  with  the Holland Tunnel, and
      running thence east to Canal Street, then running along  the  centerline
      of  Canal  Street  to  the  intersection of the Bowery and Canal Street,
      running thence in a southeasterly direction diagonally across  Manhattan
      Bridge  Plaza,  to the Manhattan Bridge, and thence along the centerline
      of the Manhattan Bridge  to  the  point  where  the  centerline  of  the
      Manhattan  Bridge  would  intersect  with  the easterly bank of the East
      River, and bounded on the north by a line running from the  intersection
      of  the  Hudson  River  with the Holland Tunnel and running thence north
      along West Avenue to the intersection of Clarkson  Street  then  running
      east  along  the  centerline  of  Clarkson Street to the intersection of
      Washington Avenue, then running south along the centerline of Washington
      Avenue to the intersection of West Houston Street, then east  along  the
      centerline  of  West  Houston  Street,  then  at the intersection of the
      Avenue of the Americas continuing east  along  the  centerline  of  East
      Houston Street to the easterly bank of the East River.
        (q)  Related  members  expense  add back. (1) Definitions. (A) Related
      member.  "Related  member"  means  a  related  person  as   defined   in
      subparagraph  (c)  of  paragraph three of subsection (b) of section four
      hundred sixty-five of the internal  revenue  code,  except  that  "fifty
      percent" shall be substituted for "ten percent".
        (B)  Effective  rate  of tax. "Effective rate of tax" means, as to any
      city, the maximum statutory rate of  tax  imposed  by  the  city  on  or
      measured   by   a   related   member's  net  income  multiplied  by  the
      apportionment percentage, if any, applicable to the related member under
    
      the laws of said jurisdiction. For  purposes  of  this  definition,  the
      effective  rate of tax as to any city is zero where the related member's
      net income tax liability in said city  is  reported  on  a  combined  or
      consolidated  return  including both the taxpayer and the related member
      where the reported transactions between the  taxpayer  and  the  related
      member  are eliminated or offset. Also, for purposes of this definition,
      when computing the effective rate of tax for a city in which  a  related
      member's  net  income  is  eliminated  or  offset by a credit or similar
      adjustment that is dependent upon the related member either  maintaining
      or  managing  intangible  property or collecting interest income in that
      city, the maximum statutory rate of tax imposed by said  city  shall  be
      decreased  to  reflect  the  statutory  rate  of tax that applies to the
      related  member  as  effectively  reduced  by  such  credit  or  similar
      adjustment.
        (C) Royalty payments. Royalty payments are payments directly connected
      to  the  acquisition,  use,  maintenance or management, ownership, sale,
      exchange, or any other disposition of licenses, trademarks,  copyrights,
      trade  names,  trade  dress,  service  marks, mask works, trade secrets,
      patents and any other similar types of intangible assets  as  determined
      by  the  commissioner  of  finance,  and  include  amounts  allowable as
      interest  deductions  under  section  one  hundred  sixty-three  of  the
      internal  revenue  code  to  the  extent  such  amounts  are directly or
      indirectly for, related to or in connection with the  acquisition,  use,
      maintenance  or  management, ownership, sale, exchange or disposition of
      such intangible assets.
        (D) Valid business purpose. A valid business purpose is  one  or  more
      business  purposes,  other  than the avoidance or reduction of taxation,
      which alone or in combination constitute the primary motivation for some
      business activity or transaction, which activity or transaction  changes
      in  a  meaningful  way, apart from tax effects, the economic position of
      the taxpayer. The economic position of the taxpayer includes an increase
      in the market share of the taxpayer, or the entry by the  taxpayer  into
      new business markets.
        (2) Royalty expense add backs. (A) For the purpose of computing entire
      net  income,  a  taxpayer  must  add  back  royalty payments directly or
      indirectly paid, accrued, or incurred in connection  with  one  or  more
      direct  or indirect transactions with one or more related members during
      the taxable year to the extent deductible in calculating federal taxable
      income.
        (B) Exceptions. (i) The adjustment required in this subdivision  shall
      not  apply  to  the  portion  of  the  royalty payment that the taxpayer
      establishes, by clear and convincing evidence of the  type  and  in  the
      form  specified  by  the  commissioner  of  finance,  meets  all  of the
      following requirements: (I) the related member was  subject  to  tax  in
      this  city  or another city within the United States or a foreign nation
      or some combination thereof on a tax  base  that  included  the  royalty
      payment  paid,  accrued  or  incurred  by the taxpayer; (II) the related
      member during the same taxable year directly or indirectly paid, accrued
      or incurred such portion to a person that is not a related  member;  and
      (III)  the  transaction  giving  rise to the royalty payment between the
      taxpayer and the related member was  undertaken  for  a  valid  business
      purpose.
        (ii)  The  adjustment  required in this subdivision shall not apply if
      the taxpayer establishes, by clear and convincing evidence of  the  type
      and  in the form specified by the commissioner of finance, that: (I) the
      related member was subject to tax on or measured by its  net  income  in
      this  city or another city within the United States, or some combination
      thereof; (II) the tax base for said tax  included  the  royalty  payment
    
      paid,  accrued  or  incurred  by  the  taxpayer; and (III) the aggregate
      effective  rate  of  tax  applied  to  the  related  member   in   those
      jurisdictions  is  no  less than eighty percent of the statutory rate of
      tax that applied to the taxpayer under section 11-643.5 of this part for
      the taxable year.
        (iii)  The  adjustment required in this subdivision shall not apply if
      the taxpayer establishes, by clear and convincing evidence of  the  type
      and  in the form specified by the commissioner of finance, that: (I) the
      royalty payment was paid,  accrued  or  incurred  to  a  related  member
      organized under the laws of a country other than the United States; (II)
      the  related  member's  income  from  the  transaction  was subject to a
      comprehensive income tax treaty between  such  country  and  the  United
      States;  (III) the related member was subject to tax in a foreign nation
      on a tax base  that  included  the  royalty  payment  paid,  accrued  or
      incurred  by  the  taxpayer;  (IV)  the related member's income from the
      transaction was taxed in such country at an effective  rate  of  tax  at
      least  equal  to  that imposed by this city; and (V) the royalty payment
      was paid, accrued  or  incurred  pursuant  to  a  transaction  that  was
      undertaken  for a valid business purpose and using terms that reflect an
      arm's length relationship.
        (iv) The adjustment required in this subdivision shall  not  apply  if
      the  taxpayer  and  the  commissioner of finance agree in writing to the
      application or use  of  alternative  adjustments  or  computations.  The
      commissioner  of  finance  may,  in  his or her discretion, agree to the
      application or use of alternative adjustments or computations when he or
      she concludes that in the absence of such agreement the  income  of  the
      taxpayer would not be properly reflected.
        (r)  For  taxable  years  beginning  on  or  after  January first, two
      thousand four, in the case of a taxpayer that is not an eligible  farmer
      as  defined in subsection (n) of section six hundred six of the tax law,
      a taxpayer shall be allowed with respect to a sport utility vehicle that
      is not a passenger automobile as defined in paragraph five of subsection
      (d) of section two hundred eighty F of the internal  revenue  code,  the
      deductions  allowable  under  sections  one  hundred  seventy-nine,  one
      hundred sixty-seven and one hundred sixty-eight of the internal  revenue
      code,  determined  as  if  such  sport  utility vehicle were a passenger
      automobile as defined in such paragraph five.
        (s) Upon the disposition of property to which subdivision (r) of  this
      section applies, the amount of any gain or loss includible in entire net
      income  shall  be  adjusted to reflect the modification provided in such
      subdivision attributable to such property.

Section 11-642
--------------

Section 11-642 ::    
        
     
        * §  11-642  Allocation.  (a)  In  general. If a taxpayer's entire net
      income, alternative entire net income, or  taxable  assets  are  derived
      from business carried on within and without the city, the taxpayer shall
      for  purposes  of  computing  allocation  percentages  compute  payroll,
      receipts, and deposits percentages  in  accordance  with  the  following
      rules:
        (1)  The  taxpayer shall ascertain the percentage which eighty percent
      of the total wages, salaries and  other  personal  service  compensation
      during  the  taxable  year  of  employees within the city, except wages,
      salaries and other personal service compensation  of  general  executive
      officers,  bears to the total wages, salaries and other personal service
      compensation during the taxable year of  all  the  taxpayer's  employees
      within  and  without the city, except wages, salaries and other personal
      service compensation of general executive officers.
        (2) (A) The taxpayer shall ascertain the percentage which the receipts
      of the taxpayer arising during the taxable year from:
        (i) loans (including a taxpayer's portion  of  a  participation  in  a
      loan)  and  financing  leases  within  the  city, and all other business
      receipts earned within the city, bear to
        (ii) the total amount of the taxpayer's receipts from loans (including
      a taxpayer's portion of a participation in a loan) and financing  leases
      and all other business receipts within and without the city.
        (B)  All interest from loans and financing leases is located where the
      greater portion of income producing activity  related  to  the  loan  or
      financing lease occurred; provided, however:
        (i)  In the case of a taxpayer described in paragraph one, two, three,
      four, five or seven of subdivision (a) of section 11-640 of this part, a
      loan or financing lease attributed by such taxpayer to a branch  without
      the  city  shall  be presumed to be properly so attributed provided that
      such  presumption  may  be  rebutted  if  the  commissioner  of  finance
      demonstrates  that  the  greater  portion  of  income producing activity
      related to the loan or financing lease did not  occur  at  such  branch.
      Where  such  presumption  has been rebutted, the loan or financing lease
      shall be presumed to be within the city if the  taxpayer  had  a  branch
      within  the  city  at the time the loan or financing lease was made. The
      taxpayer may rebut such presumption by demonstrating  that  the  greater
      portion  of  income  producing activity related to the loan or financing
      lease did not occur within the city. In the case of a loan or  financing
      lease  which  is recorded on the books of a place without the city which
      is not a branch, it shall be presumed that the greater portion of income
      producing activity related to such  loan  or  financing  lease  occurred
      within the city if the taxpayer had a branch within the city at the time
      the  loan  or  financing  lease  was  made.  The taxpayer may rebut such
      presumption  by  demonstrating  that  the  greater  portion  of   income
      producing  activity related to the loan or financing lease did not occur
      within the city.
        (ii) In the case of a taxpayer described in paragraph six or  nine  of
      subdivision  (a)  of  section  11-640  of this part, a loan or financing
      lease attributed by such taxpayer to a bona fide office without the city
      shall be presumed to  be  properly  so  attributed  provided  that  such
      presumption  may be rebutted if the commissioner of finance demonstrates
      that the greater portion of income producing  activity  related  to  the
      loan or financing lease did not occur without the city.
        (C)  Receipts  from  lease  transactions  other  than financing leases
      referred to in subparagraph (B) are located where the  property  subject
      to the lease is located.
        (D)  (i)  Interest,  and fees and penalties in the nature of interest,
      from bank, credit, travel and entertainment card receivables are  earned
    
      within the city if the mailing address of the card holder in the records
      of the taxpayer is in the city; and
        (ii)  Service  charges  and fees from such cards are earned within the
      city if the card is serviced in the city; and
        (iii) Receipts from merchant discounts are earned within the  city  if
      the merchant is located within the city.
        (E)  The  portion  of  total  net  gains and other income from trading
      activities (including but not limited to foreign exchange,  options  and
      financial  futures),  and from investment activities which is attributed
      within the city shall be ascertained by multiplying such total net gains
      and other income by a fraction the numerator of  which  is  the  average
      value  of  the  trading assets and investment assets attributable to the
      city and the denominator of which is the average value  of  all  trading
      and   investment   assets.  A  trading  asset  or  investment  asset  is
      attributable to the city if the  greater  portion  of  income  producing
      activity  related  to  the  trading  asset  or investment asset occurred
      within the city.
        (F) Fees or charges from the issuance of letters of credit,  travelers
      checks  and  money  orders are earned within the city if such letters of
      credit, travelers checks or money orders are issued within the city.
        (G) Rules for receipts from certain services to investment  companies.
      (1)  For taxable years beginning on or after January first, two thousand
      one, the portion of receipts received from an investment company arising
      from the sale of management, administration or distribution services  to
      such investment company determined in accordance with clause two of this
      subparagraph shall be deemed to arise from services performed within the
      city (such portion referred to herein as the New York city portion).
        (2) The New York city portion shall be the product of (i) the total of
      such  receipts  from  the sale of such services and (ii) a fraction. The
      numerator of that fraction is the sum of  the  monthly  percentages  (as
      defined  hereinafter)  determined  for  each  month  of  the  investment
      company's taxable year for federal income  tax  purposes  which  taxable
      year  ends  within  the  taxable year of the taxpayer (but excluding any
      month during which the investment company had  no  outstanding  shares).
      The monthly percentage for each such month is determined by dividing (i)
      the  number  of  shares in the investment company which are owned on the
      last day of the month by shareholders that are domiciled in the city  by
      (ii) the total number of shares in the investment company outstanding on
      that date. The denominator of the fraction is the number of such monthly
      percentages.
        (3)(i)  For purposes of this subparagraph, the term "domicile", in the
      case of an individual, shall have  the  meaning  ascribed  to  it  under
      chapter  seventeen of this title; an estate or trust is domiciled in the
      city if it is a city resident estate or trust as  defined  in  paragraph
      three  of  subdivision  (b)  of section 11-1705 of this code; a business
      entity is domiciled in the city if the location of the  actual  seat  of
      management  or  control  is  in  the city. It shall be presumed that the
      domicile of a shareholder, with respect to any month, is his, her or its
      mailing address on the records of the investment company as of the  last

      paragraph for purposes of its alternative entire net  income  allocation
      percentage.
        (d) Allocation of taxable assets. If the taxpayer's taxable assets are
      derived  from  business carried on both within and without the city, the
      portion thereof which is derived from business  carried  on  within  the
      city  shall  be determined by multiplying its taxable assets by an asset
      allocation percentage determined  in  the  same  manner  as  the  income
      allocation   percentage   under  subdivision  (b)  of  this  section  is
      determined when the election provided  for  in  paragraph  two  of  such

      seventy-three,  the  tax imposed by section 11-639 of this part shall be
      the greater of the following computations:
        (a) Basic tax. Five and  sixty-three  one-hundredths  percent  of  the
      taxpayer's  entire  net income, or the portion thereof allocated to this
      city, for the taxable year or part thereof. (b) Alternative minimum tax.
      If the tax under subdivision (a) is  less  than  any  of  the  following
      amounts, the tax shall be the largest of the following amounts:
        (1)  Except  for  a savings bank and savings and loan association, one
      and one-quarter mills upon each dollar of such part  of  the  taxpayer's
      issued  capital  stock  on the last day of the taxable year, at its face
      value, but if such taxpayer has stock  without  par  value,  such  stock
      shall  be  taken  at  its actual or market value, and not less than five
      dollars per share, as may be determined by the commissioner of  finance,
      as  the  gross  income of such taxpayer derived from business carried on
      within the city, during such taxable year, bears  to  its  gross  income
      derived  from all business, both within and without the city during said
      year; except that if the period covered by  the  return  is  other  than

      percent of the taxpayer's entire net  income,  or  the  portion  thereof

      one-thousandths percent of the interest or dividends credited by it to a
      depositor  or  shareholder during such accounting period, provided that,
      in  determining  such  amount,  each  interest  or  dividend  credit  to
      depositors  or  shareholders  shall  be  deemed  to  be  the interest or
      dividend actually credited or the interest or dividend which would  have
      been  credited if it had been computed and credited at the rate of three

        (A) a savings bank to a depositor or shareholder which is attributable
      to an increase or a deemed increase in the gross earnings, surplus fund,
      or net worth of the savings bank, which increase  became  available  for
      interest   or   dividends   upon  the  prior  written  approval  of  the
      superintendent of banks pursuant to the provisions of  subdivision  four
      of section two hundred forty-four of the banking law; or
        (B) a savings and loan association to a depositor or shareholder which
      is  attributable  to  an  increase or a deemed increase in gross income,
      undivided profits, surplus account or net worth of the savings and  loan
      association,  which  increase became available for interest or dividends
      upon the prior written approval of the superintendent of banks  pursuant
      to   the   provisions  of  subdivision  two  of  section  three  hundred
      eighty-seven of the banking law; or
        (C) a federal savings bank or a federal savings and  loan  association
      to  a  depositor  or shareholder, which would have required and received
      prior written approval of the superintendent  of  banks  in  respect  to
      increases  in  gross  income, gross earnings, undivided profits, surplus
      funds, surplus accounts or net worth available for dividends pursuant to
      the provisions of subdivision four of section two hundred forty-four  of
      the   banking   law   and  subdivision  two  of  section  three  hundred
      eighty-seven of the banking law, respectively, were  the  provisions  of
      sections  two  hundred  forty-four and three hundred eighty-seven of the
      banking law applicable to federal savings banks and federal savings  and
      loan  associations  shall  not  be  considered  to have been credited to
      depositors or shareholders. Where the tax  computed  under  subparagraph
      (i)  of  this paragraph is computed as if the interest or dividends were
      computed and credited at the rate of  three  and  one-half  percent  per
      annum, the amount of interest or dividends which shall not be considered
      to  have  been credited to depositors or shareholders is an amount which
      bears the same ratio to the interest or dividends which would have  been
      credited  at  the  rate  of  three and one-half percent per annum as the
      amount of that portion of the interest or dividends paid or credited  on
      or  after  the  first  day  of  October, nineteen hundred eighty-one but
      before the first day of July,  nineteen  hundred  eighty-six,  which  is
      attributable  to  an  increase or deemed increase in gross income, gross
      earnings, undivided profits, surplus funds, surplus account or net worth
      available for dividends pursuant to the provisions of  subdivision  four
      of  section two hundred forty-four of the banking law or subdivision two
      of section three hundred eighty-seven of the banking law, bears  to  the
      amount  of interest or dividends actually credited. For purposes of this
      clause, the determination of whether a federal savings bank  or  federal
      savings  and  loan  association  would  have required and received prior
      written approval of the superintendent of banks shall  be  made  by  the
      superintendent  of  banks, upon application and upon such forms as he or
      she may require, by  applying  the  provision  of  subdivision  four  of
      section two hundred forty-four of the banking law, as if such provisions
    
      were applicable to federal savings banks, and subdivision two of section
      three  hundred  eighty-seven  of  the banking law, as if such provisions
      were applicable to  federal  savings  and  loan  associations,  and  the
      superintendent  of  banks may require and examine such information as he
      or she may deem necessary to make such determinations.
        (4) (i) Except for a savings bank and savings  and  loan  association,
      twenty-five dollars.
        (ii)  For  a  savings  bank  and  savings and loan association, twenty
      dollars.

      on or after January first, nineteen hundred eighty-five, the tax imposed
      by section 11-639 of this part shall be the  greater  of  the  following
      computations:
        (a)  Basic  tax.  Nine percent of the taxpayer's entire net income, or
      the portion thereof allocated to the city, for the taxable year or  part
      thereof.
        (b)  Alternative minimum tax. If the tax under subdivision (a) of this
      section is less than any of the following amounts, the tax shall be  the
      larger of the following amounts:
        (1)  For taxable years beginning before two thousand eleven, except in
      the case of a corporation organized under the laws of  a  country  other
      than  the United States, one-tenth of a mill upon each dollar of taxable
      assets, or the portion thereof allocated to the city. For taxable  years
      beginning  after  two  thousand  ten,  except  in the case of a taxpayer
      described in clause (i), (ii), or (iii) below, one-tenth of a mill  upon
      each  dollar  of taxable assets, or the portion thereof allocated to the
      city.
        (i) In the case of a taxpayer whose net worth ratio is less than  five
      percent but greater than or equal to four percent and whose total assets
      are   comprised   of   thirty-three   percent   or  more  of  mortgages,
      one-twenty-fifth of a mill upon each dollar of taxable  assets,  or  the
      portion thereof allocated to the city.
        (ii) In the case of a taxpayer whose net worth ratio is less than four
      percent  and whose total assets are comprised of thirty-three percent or
      more of mortgages, one-fiftieth of a mill upon each  dollar  of  taxable
      assets, or the portion thereof allocated to the city.
        (iii) A taxpayer (whether or not a qualified institution as defined in
      subparagraph  (B)  of  paragraph  five of subsection (f) of section four
      hundred six of the federal national  housing  act,  as  amended,  or  as
      defined  in  paragraph  two of subsection (i) of section thirteen of the
      federal deposit insurance act, as amended) shall not be subject  to  the
      provisions  of  this  paragraph  for that portion of the taxable year in
      which it had outstanding net worth  certificates  issued  in  accordance
      with paragraph five of subsection (f) of section four hundred six of the
      federal  national  housing act, as amended, or issued in accordance with
      subsection (i) of section thirteen of the federal deposit insurance act,
      as amended.
        (iv) For the purposes of this part:  (A)  the  term  "taxable  assets"
      shall  mean  the  average value of total assets reduced by any amount of
      money or  other  property  received  from  or  attributable  to  amounts
      received  from  the  federal  deposit  insurance corporation pursuant to
      subsection (c) of section thirteen of the federal deposit insurance act,
      as amended, or  the  federal  savings  and  loan  insurance  corporation
      pursuant  to  paragraph  one,  two,  three  or four of subsection (f) of
      section four hundred  six  of  the  federal  national  housing  act,  as
      amended. Total assets are those assets which are properly reflected on a
      balance sheet the income or expenses of which are properly reflected (or
      would  have been properly reflected if not fully depreciated or expensed
      or depreciated or expensed to a nominal amount) in  the  computation  of
      alternative entire net income for the taxable year or in the computation
      of  the  eligible  net  income  of  the taxpayer's international banking
      facility for the taxable year.
        (B) The term "net worth ratio" shall mean the percentage of net  worth
      to  assets  on  the  last  day of the taxable year. The term "net worth"
      means the  sum  of  preferred  stock,  common  stock,  surplus,  capital
      reserves,  undivided  profits,  mutual capital certificates, reserve for
    
      contingencies, reserve for loan losses and reserve for  security  losses
      minus  assets  classified  loss.  The  term  "assets"  means  the sum of
      mortgage loans, nonmortgage loans, repossessed assets, real estate  held
      for  development  or  investment  or  resale, cash, deposits, investment
      securities, fixed assets and other assets (such  as  financial  futures,
      goodwill  and  other intangible assets) minus assets classified loss. In
      no event shall assets be reduced by reserves for losses.
        (C) The term "mortgages" shall mean loans  secured  by  real  property
      within   or   without   the  state,  participations  in  and  securities
      collateralized by pools of residential mortgages, whether or not  issued
      or guaranteed by a United States government agency, and loans secured by
      stock  in  a  cooperative  housing  corporation. The percentage of total
      assets comprised of mortgages shall be an amount equal to the  ratio  of
      the  average  of  the  four  quarterly balances of such mortgages ending
      within the taxable year, to the average of the four  quarterly  balances
      of  all  assets  ending within the taxable year. Such quarterly balances
      shall be computed in the same manner as the report of condition required
      for federal deposit insurance corporation or federal  savings  and  loan
      insurance  corporation purposes, whether or not such report is required.
      For taxable periods of less than one year, the  taxpayer  shall  compute
      such  ratio  using  the  number of such quarterly balances ending within
      such taxable period.
        (2) For taxable years beginning before two  thousand  eleven,  in  the
      case  of  a corporation organized under the laws of a country other than
      the United States, (i) two and six-tenths mills upon each dollar of such
      part of the taxpayer's issued capital stock  on  the  last  day  of  the
      taxable  year, at its face value, but if such taxpayer has stock without
      par value, such stock shall be taken at its actual or market value,  and
      not  less  than  five  dollars  per  share,  as may be determined by the
      commissioner of finance, or (ii) if the taxpayer does  not  have  issued
      capital stock, two and six-tenths mills upon each dollar of such part of
      the  amount  by which its average total assets exceeds its average total
      liabilities, as the gross income of such taxpayer derived from  business
      carried  on  within the city during such taxable year bears to its gross
      income derived from all business,  both  within  and  without  the  city
      during  said  year;  except  that if the period covered by the return is
      other than twelve months, the tax shall be prorated on the basis of  the
      number  of  months or major portions thereof included in the return. For
      purposes of this paragraph, the term "gross income" shall have the  same
      meaning  as  it has in the laws of the United States relating to federal
      income taxes.
        (3) Three percent of the taxpayer's alternative entire net income,  or
      portion  thereof  allocated  to  the city, for the taxable year, or part
      thereof.
        (4) One hundred twenty-five dollars.

      and  before  July  first,  two thousand, one thousand dollars; provided,
      however, that no credit shall be  allowed  for  the  relocation  of  any
      retail  activity  or hotel services; and provided that in the case of an
      eligible business that has obtained pursuant to chapter  six-B  of  such
      title  twenty-two  certifications  of  eligibility  for  more  than  one
      relocation, the portion  of  the  total  amount  of  eligible  aggregate
      employment  shares  to  be  multiplied by the dollar amount specified in
      this subdivision for each such certification of a  relocation  shall  be
      the  number  of  total  attributed  eligible aggregate employment shares
      determined with respect to such relocation pursuant to  subdivision  (o)
      of  section  22-621 of the code. For purposes of this section, the terms
      "eligible aggregate employment shares,"  "relocate,"  "retail  activity"
      and  "hotel services" shall have the meanings ascribed by section 22-621
      of the code.
        (b) The credit allowed under this section  with  respect  to  eligible
      aggregate  employment  shares  maintained  with  respect  to  particular
      premises to which the taxpayer has relocated shall be  allowed  for  the
      first  taxable  year  during  which  such  eligible aggregate employment
      shares are maintained with respect to such premises and for any  of  the
      twelve   succeeding   taxable  years  during  which  eligible  aggregate
      employment shares are maintained with respect to such premises; provided
      that the credit allowed for the twelfth succeeding taxable year shall be
      calculated by multiplying the number of  eligible  aggregate  employment
      shares   maintained  with  respect  to  such  premises  in  the  twelfth
      succeeding taxable year  by  the  lesser  of  one  and  a  fraction  the
      numerator  of  which  is  such  number  of  days  in the taxable year of
    
      relocation less the number of  days  the  eligible  business  maintained
      employment  shares  in  the  eligible  premises  in  the taxable year of
      relocation and the denominator of which is the number of  days  in  such
      twelfth  succeeding  taxable  year  during which such eligible aggregate
      employment shares are maintained with respect to such  premises.  Except
      as  provided  in  subdivision  (d) of this section, if the amount of the
      credit allowable under this section for any taxable year exceeds the tax
      imposed for such year, the excess may be carried over, in order, to  the
      five  immediately  succeeding  taxable  years  and,  to  the  extent not
      previously deductible, may be deducted from the taxpayer's tax for  such
      years.
        (c)  The  credit  allowable under this section shall be deducted after
      the credit allowed by section 11-643.8, but prior to  the  deduction  of
      any other credit allowed by this part.
        (d)  In  the  case  of a taxpayer that has obtained a certification of
      eligibility pursuant to chapter six-B of title twenty-two  of  the  code
      dated  on or after July first, two thousand for a relocation to eligible
      premises located within the revitalization area defined  in  subdivision
      (n)  of  section  22-621  of  the  code,  the credits allowed under this
      section, or in the case of a taxpayer that has relocated more than once,
      the  portion  of  such  credits  attributed  to  such  certification  of
      eligibility pursuant to subdivision (a) of this section, against the tax
      imposed  by this chapter for the taxable year of such relocation and for
      the four taxable years immediately succeeding the taxable year  of  such
      relocation, shall be deemed to be overpayments of tax by the taxpayer to
      be  credited  or  refunded,  without  interest,  in  accordance with the
      provisions of section 11-677 of this chapter. For  such  taxable  years,
      such  credits  or  portions  thereof  may  not  be  carried  over to any
      succeeding taxable year; provided, however, that this subdivision  shall
      not apply to any relocation for which an application for a certification
      of  eligibility  was  not  submitted  prior  to July first, two thousand
      three, unless the date of such relocation is on or after July first, two
      thousand.

Section 11-643.8 ::    
        
     
        § 11-643.8 Credit relating to certain distributions from partnerships.
      (a)  If a banking corporation is a partner in an unincorporated business
      taxable under chapter five of this title, and is required to include  in
      entire  net  income  its  distributive  share  of income, gain, loss and
      deductions  of,  or  guaranteed  payments  from,   such   unincorporated
      business, such banking corporation shall be allowed a credit against the
      tax  imposed  by this part equal to the lesser of the amounts determined
      in paragraphs one and two of this subdivision:
        (1) The amount determined in this paragraph is the product of (A)  the
      sum  of  (i)  the  tax  imposed  by  chapter  five  of this title on the
      unincorporated business for its taxable year ending within or  with  the
      taxable  year  of the banking corporation and paid by the unincorporated
      business and (ii) the amount of any  credit  or  credits  taken  by  the
      unincorporated  business  under section 11-503 of this title (except the
      credit allowed by subdivision (b) of such section) for its taxable  year
      ending  within  or  with the taxable year of the banking corporation, to
      the  extent  that  such  credits  do  not  reduce  such   unincorporated
      business's tax below zero, and (B) a fraction, the numerator of which is
      the net total of the banking corporation's distributive share of income,
      gain,  loss  and  deductions  of,  and  guaranteed  payments  from,  the
      unincorporated business for such taxable year  and  the  denominator  of
      which  is  the sum, for such taxable year, of the net total distributive
      shares of income, gain, loss and deductions of, and guaranteed  payments
      to,  all  partners of the unincorporated business for whom or which such
      net total (as separately determined for each partner)  is  greater  than
      zero.
        (2)  The amount determined in this paragraph is the product of (A) the
      excess of (i) the basic tax computed  pursuant  to  subdivision  (a)  of
      section  11-643.5 of this part, without allowance of any credits allowed
      by this part, over (ii) the basic tax so computed, determined as if  the
      banking  corporation  had  no  such  distributive  share  or  guaranteed
      payments  with  respect  to  the  unincorporated  business,  and  (B)  a
      fraction, the numerator of which is four and the denominator of which is
      nine,  provided,  however,  that the amounts computed in clauses (i) and
      (ii)  of  this  paragraph  shall  be   computed   with   the   following
      modifications:
        (I)  if,  prior  to  taking  into  account  any  distributive share or
      guaranteed payments from any unincorporated  business,  the  entire  net
      income of the partner is less than zero, such entire net income shall be
      treated as zero; and
        (II)  if  such partner's net total distributive share of income, gain,
      loss and deductions of, and guaranteed payments from any  unincorporated
      business is less than zero, such net total shall be treated as zero.
        The amount determined in this paragraph shall not be less than zero.
        (b) (1) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in subdivision (a) of
      this  section,  in  the  case  of a banking corporation that, before the
      application of this section or any other credit allowed by this part, is
      liable for the basic tax  computed  under  subdivision  (a)  of  section
      11-643.5  of this part, the credit or the sum of the credits that may be
      taken by such banking corporation for a taxable year under this  section
      with  respect to an unincorporated business or unincorporated businesses
      in which it is a partner shall not exceed the tax so  computed,  without
      allowance  of any credits allowed by this part, multiplied by a fraction
      the numerator of which is four and the denominator of which is nine.  If
      the  credit  allowed  under  this subdivision or the sum of such credits
      exceeds the product of such tax and such fraction,  the  amount  of  the
      excess  may  be  carried  forward,  in  order,  to  each  of  the  seven
      immediately succeeding taxable years and, to the extent  not  previously
    
      taken,  shall  be allowed as a credit in each of such years. In applying
      the provisions of the preceding sentence, the credit determined for  the
      taxable year under subdivision (a) of this section shall be taken before
      taking any credit carryforward pursuant to this paragraph and the credit
      carryforward  attributable  to  the earliest taxable year shall be taken
      before taking a credit carryforward attributable to a subsequent taxable
      year.
        (2) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary  in  subdivision  (a)  of
      this  section,  in  the  case  of a banking corporation that, before the
      application of this section or any other credit allowed by this part, is
      liable for the alternative minimum tax on alternative entire net  income
      under  paragraph  three  of  subdivision (b) of section 11-643.5 of this
      part, the maximum credit that may be taken in any taxable  year  is  the
      amount  that  will  reduce the tax so computed, without allowance of any
      credits allowed by this part, to zero.  For purposes of  this  paragraph
      each  dollar  of  credit  shall  be  applied so as to reduce such tax by
      seventy-five cents. If the amount of credit allowed under  this  section
      or  the sum of such credits exceeds the amount that may be taken against
      such tax, the amount of the excess may be carried forward, in order,  to
      each  of  the  seven  immediately  succeeding  taxable years and, to the
      extent not previously taken, shall be allowed as a  credit  in  each  of
      such  years.  In  applying the provisions of the preceding sentence, the
      credit determined for the taxable year under  subdivision  (a)  of  this
      section shall be taken before taking any credit carryforward pursuant to
      this  subdivision  and  the  credit  carryforward  attributable  to  the
      earliest taxable year shall be taken before taking a credit carryforward
      attributable to a subsequent taxable year.
        (3) No credit under this section may be taken in a taxable year  by  a
      taxpayer  that,  in  the absence of such credit, would be liable for the
      tax computed on the basis of taxable assets under paragraph one, the tax
      computed on the basis of issued capital stock under paragraph two or the
      fixed-dollar minimum tax under paragraph  four  of  subdivision  (b)  of
      section 11-643.5 of this part.
        (c)  For  banking  corporations that file a report on a combined basis
      pursuant to subdivision (f) of section 11-646 of this part,  the  credit
      allowed  by this section shall be computed as if the combined group were
      the partner in each  unincorporated  business  from  which  any  of  the
      members  of  such group had a distributive share or guaranteed payments,
      provided, however, if more than one member of the combined  group  is  a
      partner  in  the  same  unincorporated  business,  for  purposes  of the
      calculation required  in  paragraph  one  of  subdivision  (a)  of  this
      section,  the numerator of the fraction described in subparagraph (B) of
      such paragraph one shall be the sum of the net total distributive shares
      of income, gain, loss and deductions of, and guaranteed  payments  from,
      the unincorporated business of all of the partners of the unincorporated
      business  within  the  combined  group  for  which  such  net  total (as
      separately determined for each partner) is greater than  zero,  and  the
      denominator  of  such  fraction  shall  be  the  sum  of  the  net total
      distributive shares  of  income,  gain,  loss  and  deductions  of,  and
      guaranteed payments from, the unincorporated business of all partners in
      the  unincorporated  business  for  whom  or  which  such  net total (as
      separately determined for each partner) is greater than zero.
        (d) The credit allowed by this section  shall  not  be  allowed  to  a
      partner  in  an  unincorporated business with respect to any tax paid by
      the unincorporated business under chapter five of  this  title  for  any
      taxable year beginning before July first, nineteen hundred ninety-four.
        (e)  Notwithstanding  any  other  provisions  of this part, the credit
      allowable under this section shall be taken prior to the taking  of  any
    
      other credit allowed by this part.  Notwithstanding any other provisions
      of this part, the application of this section shall not change the basis
      on  which the taxpayer's tax is computed under subdivision (a) or (b) of
      section 11-643.5 of this part.

Section 11-643.9 ::    
        
     
        §  11-643.9  Lower  Manhattan  relocation  and  employment  assistance
      credit.  (a) In addition to any other credit allowed  by  this  part,  a
      taxpayer  that has obtained the certifications required by chapter six-C
      of title twenty-two of the code shall be allowed a  credit  against  the
      tax  imposed  by this part. The amount of the credit shall be the amount
      determined by multiplying  three  thousand  dollars  by  the  number  of
      eligible  aggregate  employment shares maintained by the taxpayer during
      the taxable year with respect to eligible premises to which the taxpayer
      has relocated; provided, however, that no credit shall  be  allowed  for
      the  relocation  of  any  retail  activity  or hotel services; provided,
      further, that no credit shall be  allowed  under  this  section  to  any
      taxpayer  that has elected pursuant to subdivision (d) of section 22-624
      of the code to take such credit against a  gross  receipts  tax  imposed
      under  chapter  eleven  of this title. For purposes of this section, the
      terms  "eligible  aggregate  employment  shares",  "eligible  premises",
      "relocate",  "retail  activity"  and  "hotel  services"  shall  have the
      meanings ascribed by section 22-623 of the code.
        (b) The credit allowed under this section  with  respect  to  eligible
      aggregate employment shares maintained with respect to eligible premises
      to  which  the  taxpayer  has relocated shall be allowed for the taxable
      year of the relocation and for any  of  the  twelve  succeeding  taxable
      years  during  which eligible aggregate employment shares are maintained
      with respect to eligible premises; provided that the credit allowed  for
      the  twelfth  succeeding taxable year shall be calculated by multiplying
      the number of  eligible  aggregate  employment  shares  maintained  with
      respect  to  eligible premises in the twelfth succeeding taxable year by
      the lesser of one and a fraction the numerator of which is  such  number
      of  days  in  the taxable year of relocation less the number of days the
      taxpayer maintained  employment  shares  in  eligible  premises  in  the
      taxable year of relocation and the denominator of which is the number of
      days  in such twelfth succeeding taxable year during which such eligible
      aggregate  employment  shares  are  maintained  with  respect  to   such
      premises.
        (c)  Except  as  provided  in  subdivision (d) of this section, if the
      amount of the credit allowable under this section for any  taxable  year
      exceeds  the  tax imposed for such year, the excess may be carried over,
      in order, to the five immediately succeeding taxable years and,  to  the
      extent  not  previously  deductible, may be deducted from the taxpayer's
      tax for such years.
        (d) The credits allowed under this section, against the tax imposed by
      this chapter for the taxable year of the relocation  and  for  the  four
      taxable   years   immediately   succeeding  the  taxable  year  of  such
      relocation, shall be deemed to be overpayments of tax by the taxpayer to
      be credited or  refunded,  without  interest,  in  accordance  with  the
      provisions  of  section  11-677 of this chapter. For such taxable years,
      such credits or  portions  thereof  may  not  be  carried  over  to  any
      succeeding taxable year.
        (e)  The  credit  allowable under this section shall be deducted after
      the credit allowed by section 11-643.7 of this part, but  prior  to  the
      deduction of any other credit allowed by this part.
    
    
    
    
    
    
    

Section 11-644
--------------

Section 11-644 ::    
        
     
        §   11-644   Declarations   of  estimated  tax.  (a)  Requirements  of
      declaration.  Every taxpayer subject to the tax imposed  by  subdivision
      (a)  of  section  11-639  of  this  part shall make a declaration of its
      estimated tax for the current taxable year, containing such  information
      as   the  commissioner  of  finance  may  prescribe  by  regulations  or
      instructions, if such estimated tax can reasonably be expected to exceed
      one thousand dollars.
        (b) Definition of estimated tax. The term "estimated  tax"  means  the
      amount  which  a taxpayer estimates to be the tax imposed by subdivision
      (a) of section 11-639 of this part for the current  taxable  year,  less
      the  amount  which  it  estimates to be the sum of any credits allowable
      against the tax.
        (c) Time for filing declaration. A declaration of estimated tax  shall
      be  filed on or before June fifteenth of the current taxable year in the
      case of a taxpayer which reports on the basis of a calendar year, except
      that if the requirements of subdivision (a) of this  section  are  first
      met:
        (1)  after May thirty-first and before September first of such current
      taxable year, the declaration shall be  filed  on  or  before  September
      fifteenth, or
        (2)  after  August  thirty-first  and  before  December  first of such
      current taxable year, the  declaration  shall  be  filed  on  or  before
      December fifteenth.
        (d)  Amendments  of  declaration.  A  taxpayer may amend a declaration
      under regulations of the commissioner of finance.
        (e) Return as declaration. If, on or before February fifteenth of  the
      succeeding  year  in  the  case  of  a  taxpayer whose taxable year is a
      calendar year, a taxpayer files its return for the year  for  which  the
      declaration  is required, and pays therewith the balance, if any, of the
      full amount of the tax shown to be due on the return:
        (1)  such  return  shall  be  considered  as  its  declaration  if  no
      declaration  was  required to be filed during the taxable year for which
      the tax was imposed, but is otherwise required to be filed on or  before
      December  fifteenth pursuant to paragraph two of subdivision (c) of this
      section, and
        (2) such return shall be considered  as  the  amendment  permitted  by
      subdivision  (d)  of  this  section  to  be  filed on or before December
      fifteenth if the tax shown on the return is greater than  the  estimated
      tax shown on a declaration previously made.
        (f)  Fiscal  year. This section shall apply to taxable years of twelve
      months other than a calendar year by the substitutions of the months  of
      such fiscal year for the corresponding months specified in this section.
        (g)  Short  taxable  period.  If the taxable period for which a tax is
      imposed by subdivision (a) of section 11-639 of this part is  less  than
      twelve  months,  every  taxpayer  required  to  make  a  declaration  of
      estimated tax for such taxable period shall make such a  declaration  in
      accordance with regulations of the commissioner of finance.
        (h)  Extension  of  time.  The  commissioner  of  finance  may grant a
      reasonable extension of time, not to exceed three months, for the filing
      of any declaration required pursuant to this section, on such terms  and
      conditions as the commissioner may require.
    
    
    
    
    
    
    

Section 11-645
--------------

Section 11-645 ::    
        
     
        §  11-645 Payments of estimated tax. (a) Every taxpayer subject to the
      tax imposed by section 11-639 of this part shall pay an amount equal  to
      twenty-five  percent  of  the  preceding  year's  tax, if such preceding
      year's tax exceeded one thousand dollars. Such amount shall be paid with
      the return required to be filed for the preceding taxable year  or  with
      an  application  for  the  extension of the time for filing such return.
      Provided, however, that for the first taxable year or period  commencing
      on   or   after  January  first,  nineteen  hundred  seventy-three,  the
      installment required by this subdivision shall be paid with  the  return
      required  to be filed for the tax imposed pursuant to part one or two of
      this subchapter three computed on  the  basis  of  net  income  for  the
      calendar  year  nineteen  hundred  seventy-two, or under the minimum tax
      provisions of section 11-612 of this subchapter.
        (b) Other installments. The estimated tax for each taxable  year  with
      respect  to which a declaration of estimated tax is required to be filed
      under this part shall be paid, in the case of a taxpayer  which  reports
      on the basis of a calendar year, as follows:
        (1)  If  the  declaration  is  filed  on or before June fifteenth, the
      estimated tax shown thereon, after applying thereto the amount, if  any,
      paid  during  the  same taxable year pursuant to subdivision (a) of this
      section, shall  be  paid  in  three  equal  installments.  One  of  such
      installments shall be paid at the time of the filing of the declaration,
      one  shall  be paid on the following September fifteenth, and one on the
      following December fifteenth.
        (2) If the declaration is filed after June  fifteenth  and  not  after
      September  fifteenth  of  such  taxable  year, and is not required to be
      filed on or before June fifteenth of such year, the estimated tax  shown
      on  such  declaration,  after  applying thereto the amount, if any, paid
      during the same  taxable  year  pursuant  to  subdivision  (a)  of  this
      section,   shall  be  paid  in  two  equal  installments.  One  of  such
      installments shall be paid at the time of the filing of the  declaration
      and one shall be paid on the following December fifteenth.
        (3)  If  the  declaration  is  filed after September fifteenth of such
      taxable year, and is not required to be filed  on  or  before  September
      fifteenth  of  such  year,  the estimated tax shown on such declaration,
      after applying thereto the amount, if any, paid in respect of such  year
      pursuant  to  subdivision  (a) of this section, shall be paid in full at
      the time of the filing of the declaration.
        (4) If the declaration is filed after the time prescribed therefor, or
      after the expiration of any extension of time therefor,  paragraphs  two
      and three of this subdivision shall not apply and there shall be paid at
      the  time of such filing all installments of estimated tax payable at or
      before such time, and the remaining installments shall be  paid  at  the
      times  at  which,  and  in  the  amounts  in which, they would have been
      payable if the declaration had been filed when due.
        (c) Amendments of declarations. If any amendment of a  declaration  is
      filed, the remaining installments, if any, shall be ratably increased or
      decreased  (as  the  case may be) to reflect any increase or decrease in
      the estimated tax by reason of such amendment, and if any  amendment  is
      made  after September fifteenth of the taxable year, any increase in the
      estimated tax by reason thereof shall be paid at the time of making such
      amendment.
        (d) Application of installments based on the preceding year's tax. Any
      amount paid pursuant to subdivision (a) shall  be  applied  as  a  first
      installment  against  the  estimated tax of the taxpayer for the taxable
      year shown on the declaration required to be filed pursuant  to  section
      11-644, or if no declaration of estimated tax is required to be filed by
      the  taxpayer  pursuant  to  such  section,  any  such  amount  shall be
    
      considered a payment on account of the tax shown on the return  required
      to be filed by the taxpayer for such taxable year.
        (e)  Interest  on  certain  installments based on the preceding year's
      tax.  Notwithstanding the provisions of section 11-679 of  this  chapter
      or  of  section  three-a of the general municipal law, if an amount paid
      pursuant to subdivision (a) of this section exceeds the tax shown on the
      return required to be filed by the taxpayer for the taxable year  during
      which  the  amount  was  paid, interest shall be allowed and paid on the
      amount by which the amount so paid pursuant to such subdivision  exceeds
      such  tax,  at  the  overpayment rate set by the commissioner of finance
      pursuant to section 11-687 of this chapter, or, if no rate  is  set,  at
      the rate of six percent per annum from the date of payment of the amount
      so  paid  pursuant to such subdivision to the fifteenth day of the third
      month following the close of the taxable year, provided,  however,  that
      no  interest  shall  be  allowed  or  paid under this subdivision if the
      amount thereof is less than one dollar.
        (f) The preceding year's tax defined. As used in  this  section,  "the
      preceding  year's  tax"  means  the  tax  imposed  upon  the taxpayer by
      subdivision (a) of section 11-639 of this part for the preceding taxable
      year, or, for purposes of computing the first installment  of  estimated
      tax  when  an  application  has been filed for extension of the time for
      filing the return required to be filed for such preceding taxable  year,
      the amount properly estimated pursuant to paragraph one of subdivision b
      of  section 11-647 of this part as the tax imposed upon the taxpayer for
      such taxable year. Provided, however, that for the first taxable year or
      period  commencing  on  or  after  January   first,   nineteen   hundred
      seventy-three,  the  term "preceding year's tax" as used in this section
      shall mean the tax imposed upon the taxpayer pursuant to part one or two
      of this subchapter three which was computed on the basis of  net  income
      for the calendar year nineteen hundred seventy-two, or under the minimum
      tax  provisions of subdivision two of section 11-612 of this subchapter,
      or for purposes of computing the first installment of estimated tax  for
      such first taxable year or period when an application has been filed for
      an  extension of the time for filing the return required to be filed for
      the tax imposed pursuant to part one or two  of  this  subchapter  three
      which  was  computed  on  the  basis of net income for the calendar year
      nineteen hundred seventy-two, or under the  minimum  tax  provisions  of
      section  11-612 of this subchapter, the amount of tax properly estimated
      for purposes of such part one or two pursuant to section 11-635 of  this
      subchapter.
        (g) Application to short taxable period. This section shall apply to a
      taxable period of less than twelve months in accordance with regulations
      of the commissioner of finance.
        (h) Fiscal year. The provisions of this section shall apply to taxable
      years of twelve months other than a calendar year by the substitution of
      the months of such fiscal year for the corresponding months specified in
      such provisions.
        (i)  Extension  of  time.  The  commissioner  of  finance  may grant a
      reasonable extension of time, not to exceed six months, for  payment  of
      any  installment  of estimated tax required pursuant to this section, on
      such terms and conditions as the commissioner may require, including the
      furnishing of a bond or other security by the taxpayer in an amount  not
      exceeding  twice  the amount for which any extension of time for payment
      is granted, provided, however that interest at the underpayment rate set
      by the commissioner of  finance  pursuant  to  section  11-687  of  this
      chapter,  or,  if  no  rate  is  set,  at the rate of seven and one-half
      percent per annum for the period of the extension shall be  charged  and
    
      collected  on  the amount for which any extension of time for payment is
      granted under this subdivision.
        (j)  Payment  of  installments in advance. A taxpayer may elect to pay
      any installment of estimated tax prior to the date  prescribed  in  this
      section for payment thereof.

Section 11-646 ::    
        
     
        §  11-646  Returns. (a) Every taxpayer shall annually on or before the
      fifteenth day of the third month following the  close  of  each  of  its
      taxable years transmit to the commissioner of finance a return in a form
      prescribed  by  the  commissioner  setting forth such information as the
      commissioner of finance may prescribe and every taxpayer which ceases to
      exercise its franchise in the city or to be subject to the  tax  imposed
      by  this  part shall transmit to the commissioner of finance a return on
      the date of such cessation or at such other time as the commissioner  of
      finance may require covering each year or period for which no return was
      therefore filed.
        (b)  Every  taxpayer  shall  also transmit such other returns and such
      facts and information as the commissioner of finance may require in  the
      administration of this part.
        * (c)  The commissioner of finance may grant a reasonable extension of
      time for  filing  returns  whenever  good  cause  exists.  An  automatic
      extension  of  six  months  for the filing of its annual return shall be
      allowed any taxpayer, if within the time prescribed by subdivision  (a),
      such  taxpayer files with the commissioner of finance an application for
      extension in such form as said commissioner of finance may prescribe  by
      regulation  and  pays  on  or  before the date of such filing the amount
      properly estimated as its tax.
        * NB Amended L.L. 64/85 § 2, language juxtaposed per Ch. 907/85 § 14
        (d) Every return shall have annexed thereto  a  certification  by  the
      president,   vice   president,  treasurer,  assistant  treasurer,  chief
      accounting officer or any other officer of the taxpayer duly  authorized
      so  to act to the effect that the statements contained therein are true.
      The fact that an individual's name is signed on a certification  of  the
      return  shall be prima facie evidence that such individual is authorized
      to sign and certify the return on behalf of the corporation.
        (e) If the amount  of  taxable  income,  alternative  minimum  taxable
      income  or  other  basis  of tax for any year of any taxpayer, or of any
      shareholder  of  any  taxpayer  that  has  elected  to  be  taxed  under
      subchapter  s  of  chapter  one  of  the internal revenue code or of any
      shareholder of any taxpayer with respect to which an election  has  been
      made  to  be  treated  as  a  qualified  subchapter  s  subsidiary under
      paragraph three of subsection (b) of section thirteen hundred  sixty-one
      of  the  internal revenue code as returned to the United States treasury
      department or the New York state commissioner of taxation and finance is
      changed or corrected by the commissioner of internal  revenue  or  other
      officer  of  the  United  States  or  the New York state commissioner of
      taxation and finance or other competent authority, or if a  taxpayer  or
      such  shareholder  of  a taxpayer, pursuant to subsection (d) of section
      sixty-two hundred thirteen of the  internal  revenue  code,  executes  a
      notice  of waiver of the restrictions provided in subsection (a) of said
      section, or if a taxpayer or such shareholder of a taxpayer, pursuant to
      subsection (f) of section  one  thousand  eighty-one  of  the  tax  law,
      executes  a  notice of waiver of the restrictions provided in subsection
      (c) of  said  section,  such  taxpayer  shall  report  such  changed  or
      corrected  taxable  income,  alternative minimum taxable income or other
      basis of tax or such execution of such notice of waiver and the  changes
      or  corrections  of  the  taxpayer's  federal  or New York state taxable
      income, alternative minimum taxable income or  other  basis  of  tax  on
      which  it  is  based, within ninety days (or one hundred twenty days, in
      the case of a taxpayer making a combined return  under  this  subchapter
      for  such  year) after such execution or the final determination of such
      change or correction, or as required by the commissioner of finance, and
      shall concede the accuracy of such determination or state wherein it  is
      erroneous.  The allowance of a tentative carryback adjustment based upon
    
      a net capital loss carryback  pursuant  to  section  sixty-four  hundred
      eleven  of  the  internal  revenue  code,  shall  be  treated as a final
      determination for purposes of this subdivision. Any taxpayer  filing  an
      amended  return  with such department shall also file within ninety days
      (or one hundred twenty days, in the case of a taxpayer making a combined
      return under this subchapter for such year) thereafter an amended return
      with the commissioner of finance which shall contain such information as
      the commissioner shall require.
        (f) * (1) For purposes of this subdivision,  the  term  "bank  holding
      company" means any corporation subject to article three-A of the banking
      law,  or  registered  under  the  federal  bank  holding  company act of
      nineteen hundred fifty-six, as amended, or registered as a  savings  and
      loan  holding  company  (but  excluding  a  diversified savings and loan
      holding company) under the federal national housing act, as amended.
        * NB Amended Ch. 298/85 § 45, language juxtaposed per Ch. 907/85 § 14
        (2) * (i) Any banking corporation or bank  holding  company  which  is
      doing business in the city in a corporate or organized capacity, and
        (A)  which owns or controls, directly or indirectly, eighty percent or
      more of the voting stock of one or more  banking  corporations  or  bank
      holding companies, or
        (B)  whose voting stock is eighty percent or more owned or controlled,
      directly or indirectly, by a  banking  corporation  or  a  bank  holding
      company,
      shall  make a return on a combined basis under this part covering itself
      and such corporations described in clause (A) or (B) and shall set forth
      such information as the commissioner of finance may require  unless  the
      taxpayer or the commissioner of finance shows that the inclusion of such
      a  corporation  in the combined return fails to properly reflect the tax
      liability of such corporation under this part. Provided,  however,  that
      no  banking  corporation or bank holding company not a taxpayer shall be
      subject to the requirements of this subparagraph unless the commissioner
      of finance deems that the application of such requirements is  necessary
      in  order to properly reflect the tax liability under this part, because
      of  intercompany  transactions   or   some   agreement,   understanding,
      arrangement or transaction of the type referred to in subdivision (g) of
      this section.
        * NB Amended Ch. 298/85 § 45, language juxtaposed per Ch. 907/85 § 14
        * (ii)  In  the discretion of the commissioner of finance, any banking
      corporation or bank holding company which is doing business in the  city
      in a corporate or organized capacity, and
        (A) which owns or controls, directly or indirectly, sixty-five percent
      or  more of the voting stock of one or more banking corporations or bank
      holding companies, or
        (B) whose  voting  stock  is  sixty-five  percent  or  more  owned  or
      controlled,  directly  or indirectly, by a banking corporation or a bank
      holding company,
      may be required or permitted to make a return on a combined basis  under
      this  part covering itself and such corporations described in clause (A)
      or (B) and shall set forth  such  information  as  the  commissioner  of
      finance may require; provided, however, that no combined return shall be
      required  or  permitted  unless  the  commissioner of finance deems such
      report necessary in order to properly reflect the  tax  liability  under
      this  part  of  any  one  or  more  of such banking corporations or bank
      holding companies.
        * NB Amended Ch. 298/85 § 45, language juxtaposed per Ch. 907/85 § 14
        * (iii) In the discretion of  the  commissioner  of  finance,  banking
      corporations or bank holding companies which are each sixty-five percent
      or  more  owned  or  controlled,  directly  or  indirectly,  by the same
    
      interest may be permitted or required to make a  return  on  a  combined
      basis  under  this  part  and  shall  set  forth such information as the
      commissioner of finance may  require,  if  at  least  one  such  banking
      corporation  or  bank holding company is doing business in the city in a
      corporate or organized capacity. No combined return shall be required or
      permitted unless the commissioner of finance deems such report necessary
      in order to properly reflect the tax liability under this  part  of  any
      one or more of such banking corporations or bank holding companies.
        * NB Amended Ch. 298/85 § 45, language juxtaposed per Ch. 907/85 § 14
        * (iv)  (A)  Notwithstanding any provision of this paragraph, any bank
      holding company exercising its corporate franchise or doing business  in
      the  city  may  make  a  return  on a combined basis without seeking the
      permission of the commissioner with any banking  corporation  exercising
      its  corporate franchise or doing business in the city in a corporate or
      organized capacity sixty-five percent or more of whose voting  stock  is
      owned  or  controlled,  directly  or  indirectly,  by  such bank holding
      company, for the first taxable year beginning on or after January first,
      two thousand and before January first, two thousand fifteen during which
      such bank holding company registers for the first time under the federal
      bank holding company act, as amended, and also elects to be a  financial
      holding company. In addition, for each subsequent taxable year beginning
      after January first, two thousand and before January first, two thousand
      fifteen,  any  such  bank  holding  company may file on a combined basis
      without seeking the permission of  the  commissioner  with  any  banking
      corporation that is exercising its corporate franchise or doing business
      in  the  city  and  sixty-five  percent or more of whose voting stock is
      owned or controlled,  directly  or  indirectly,  by  such  bank  holding
      company  if  either such banking corporation is exercising its corporate
      franchise or doing business in the city  in  a  corporate  or  organized
      capacity  for  the  first  time  during such subsequent taxable year, or
      sixty-five  percent  or  more  of  the  voting  stock  of  such  banking
      corporation is owned or controlled, directly or indirectly, by such bank
      holding  company for the first time during such subsequent taxable year.
      Provided however, for  each  subsequent  taxable  year  beginning  after
      January  first,  two  thousand  and  before  January first, two thousand
      fifteen, a banking corporation described in either of the two  preceding
      sentences  which  filed  on  a combined basis with any such bank holding
      company in a previous taxable year, must continue to file on a  combined
      basis with such bank holding company if such banking corporation, during
      such  subsequent  taxable  year,  continues  to  exercise  its corporate
      franchise or do business  in  the  city  in  a  corporate  or  organized
      capacity  and  sixty-five  percent or more of such banking corporation's
      voting  stock  continues  to  be  owned  or  controlled,   directly   or
      indirectly,  by  such bank holding company, unless the permission of the
      commissioner has been obtained to file on  a  separate  basis  for  such
      subsequent  taxable year. Provided further, however, for each subsequent
      taxable year beginning after January  first,  two  thousand  and  before
      January  first, two thousand fifteen, a banking corporation described in
      either of the first two sentences of this clause which did not file on a
      combined basis with any such bank holding company in a previous  taxable
      year,  may  not  file on a combined basis with such bank holding company
      during any such subsequent taxable year unless  the  permission  of  the
      commissioner  has  been  obtained  to  file on a combined basis for such
      subsequent taxable year.
        (B) Notwithstanding any provision of this paragraph other than  clause
      (A)  of  this  subparagraph,  the  commissioner  may  not require a bank
      holding company which, during a  taxable  year  beginning  on  or  after
      January  first,  two  thousand  and  before  January first, two thousand
    
      fifteen, registers for the first time during such taxable year under the
      federal bank holding company act, as amended, and also elects  to  be  a
      financial  holding company, to make a return on a combined basis for any
      taxable  year  beginning  on  or  after  January first, two thousand and
      before January first, two thousand fifteen with  a  banking  corporation
      sixty-five percent or more of whose voting stock is owned or controlled,
      directly or indirectly, by such bank holding company.
        * NB There are 2 sbù (iv)'s
        * (iv)(A)  For  purposes  of  this  subparagraph,  the  term  "closest
      controlling stockholder" means the corporation that indirectly  owns  or
      controls  over  fifty  percent  of the voting stock of a captive REIT or
      captive RIC, is subject  to  tax  under  this  subchapter  or  otherwise
      required  to  be included in a combined return under this chapter and is
      the fewest tiers of corporations away in the  ownership  structure  from
      the  captive  REIT  or  captive  RIC.  The commissioner is authorized to
      prescribe  by  regulation  or  published  guidance  the   criteria   for
      determining the closest controlling stockholder.
        (B)  A  captive  REIT  or a captive RIC must be included in a combined
      return with  the  banking  corporation  or  bank  holding  company  that
      directly  owns or controls over fifty percent of the voting stock of the
      captive REIT or captive RIC if that banking corporation or bank  holding
      company  is  subject  to  tax  or  required to be included in a combined
      return under this subchapter.
        (C) If over fifty percent of the voting stock of  a  captive  REIT  or
      captive RIC is not directly owned or controlled by a banking corporation
      or  bank  holding  company  that  is  subject  to  tax or required to be
      included in a combined return under this subchapter,  then  the  captive
      REIT  or  captive  RIC  must  be  included in a combined return with the
      corporation that is the closest controlling stockholder of  the  captive
      REIT  or  captive  RIC.  If  the  closest controlling stockholder of the
      captive REIT or captive RIC is a banking  corporation  or  bank  holding
      company that is subject to tax or otherwise required to be included in a
      combined  return under this subchapter, then the captive REIT or captive
      RIC must be included in a combined return under this subchapter.
        (D) If the corporation which directly  owns  or  controls  the  voting
      stock  of  the  captive REIT or captive RIC is described in subparagraph
      (ii) of  paragraph  four  of  this  subdivision  as  a  corporation  not
      permitted  to  make a combined return, then the provisions in clause (C)
      of this subparagraph must be applied to  determine  the  corporation  in
      whose  combined  return  the  captive  REIT  or  captive  RIC  should be
      included. If, under clause (C) of  this  subparagraph,  the  corporation
      that  is  the  closest  controlling  stockholder  of the captive REIT or
      captive RIC is described in subparagraph (ii) or (iv) of paragraph  four
      of  this  subdivision  as a corporation not permitted to make a combined
      return, then that corporation is deemed  to  not  be  in  the  ownership
      structure   of  the  captive  REIT  or  captive  RIC,  and  the  closest
      controlling stockholder  will  be  determined  without  regard  to  that
      corporation.
        (E)  If  a  captive REIT owns the stock of a qualified REIT subsidiary
      (as defined in paragraph two of subsection (i) of section eight  hundred
      fifty-six  of  the  internal  revenue  code),  then  the  qualified REIT
      subsidiary must be included in any combined return required to  be  made
      by the captive REIT that owns its stock.
        (F)  If  a  captive  REIT  or  a  captive  RIC  is required under this
      subparagraph  to  be  included  in  a  combined  return   with   another
      corporation,  and that other corporation is required to be included in a
      combined return with another corporation under other provisions of  this
    
      subdivision,  the  captive  REIT or captive RIC must be included in that
      combined return with those corporations.
        (G)  If  the banking corporation or bank holding company that directly
      or indirectly owns or controls over fifty percent of the voting stock of
      the  captive  REIT  or  captive  RIC  and  is  the  closest  controlling
      stockholder  of  the  captive  REIT  or  captive  RIC  is a member of an
      affiliated group (1) that does  not  include  any  corporation  that  is
      engaged  in a business that a subsidiary of a bank holding company would
      not be permitted to engage in, unless such business is de  minimis,  and
      (2)  whose  members  own assets the combined average value of which does
      not exceed eight billion dollars, then the captive REIT or  captive  RIC
      must not be included in a combined return under this subchapter. In that
      instance,  the  captive REIT or captive RIC is subject to the provisions
      of subdivision seven or eight of section 11-603  of  this  chapter.  The
      term  "affiliated  group" means "affiliated group" as defined in section
      fifteen hundred four of the internal revenue code, but without regard to
      the exceptions provided for in subsection (b) of that section.
        * NB There are 2 sbù (iv)'s
        (v) For taxable years beginning on or after January first two thousand
      eleven, a banking corporation doing business in the city solely  because
      it  meets  one  or more of the tests in subparagraphs (i) through (v) of
      paragraph one of subdivision (c)  of  section  11-639  of  this  chapter
      (referred to in this subparagraph as the "credit card bank") will not be
      included  in  a  combined  return  pursuant  to subparagraph (i) of this
      paragraph with another banking corporation or bank holding company which
      is doing business in the  city  unless  the  credit  card  bank  or  the
      commissioner  shows  that  the  inclusion of the credit card bank in the
      combined return is necessary to properly reflect the  tax  liability  of
      the  credit  card  bank, the banking corporation or bank holding company
      under this subchapter. However, any banking corporation that  meets  one
      or  more  of the tests in subparagraphs (i) through (v) of paragraph one
      of subsection (c) of section 11-639 of this chapter and was included  in
      a  combined  return  for  its last taxable year beginning before January
      first, two thousand eleven may continue to be  included  in  a  combined
      return  for  future  taxable  years,  provided  that  once  that banking
      corporation has been included in a combined return for any taxable  year
      beginning  on  or  after  January  first,  two  thousand eleven, it must
      continue to be included in  a  combined  return  until  it  obtains  the
      consent of the commissioner to cease being included in a combined return
      because  the  combined  return  no  longer  properly  reflects  the  tax
      liability under this subchapter of any of the corporations  included  in
      the combined return. Further, the credit card bank will be included in a
      combined  return  with  (A)  any  banking corporation not subject to tax
      under this subchapter sixty-five percent or more of whose  voting  stock
      is owned or controlled, directly or indirectly, by the credit card bank,
      or  (B)  any  banking corporation or bank holding company not subject to
      tax  under  this  subchapter  which  owns  or  controls,   directly   or
      indirectly, sixty-five percent or more of the voting stock of the credit
      card  bank, or (C) any banking corporation not subject to tax under this
      subchapter sixty-five percent or more of the voting stock  of  which  is
      owned  or controlled, directly or indirectly, by the same corporation or
      corporations that own or control,  directly  or  indirectly,  sixty-five
      percent  or  more  of  the  voting stock of the credit card bank, if the
      corporation or corporations described in clauses (A),  (B)  and  (C)  of
      this  subparagraph  provide  services  for or support to the credit card
      bank's operations, unless the credit card bank or the commissioner shows
      that the inclusion of any of those corporations in the  combined  return
      fails to properly reflect the tax liability of the credit card bank. For
    
      purposes  of  this  subparagraph,  services for or support to the credit
      card bank's  operations  include  such  activities  as  billing,  credit
      investigation  and reporting, marketing, research, advertising, mailing,
      customer   service,   information   technology,  lending  and  financing
      services, and communications services, but will not include  accounting,
      legal or personnel services.
        (3) (i) In the case of a combined return, the tax shall be measured by
      the  combined  entire net income, combined alternative entire net income
      or combined assets of all  the  corporations  included  in  the  return,
      including  any  captive  REIT  or captive RIC. The allocation percentage
      shall be computed based on the combined factors with respect to all  the
      corporations  included  in  the  combined  return. In computing combined
      entire net income and  alternative  entire  net  income,  intercorporate
      dividends and all other intercorporate transactions shall be eliminated,
      and  in  computing  combined  assets,  intercorporate  stockholdings and
      intercorporate bills, notes and  accounts  receivable  and  payable  and
      other intercorporate indebtedness shall be eliminated.
        (ii)  In the case of a captive REIT required under this subdivision to
      be included in a combined return, "entire net income" means "real estate
      investment  trust  taxable  income"  as  defined  in  paragraph  two  of
      subdivision  (b)  of  section  eight hundred fifty-seven (as modified by
      section eight hundred fifty-eight) of the internal  revenue  code,  plus
      the  amount  taxable under paragraph three of subdivision (b) of section
      eight hundred fifty-seven of that code,  subject  to  the  modifications
      required by section 11-641 of this chapter. In the case of a captive RIC
      required  under  this  subdivision  to be included in a combined return,
      "entire net income" means "investment company taxable income" as defined
      in paragraph two of subdivision (b) of section eight  hundred  fifty-two
      (as  modified  by  section  eight  hundred  fifty-five)  of the internal
      revenue  code,  plus  the  amount  taxable  under  paragraph  three   of
      subdivision (b) of section eight hundred fifty-two of that code, subject
      to  the  modifications  required  by  section  11-641  of  this chapter.
      However, the deduction under the internal  revenue  code  for  dividends
      paid  by the captive REIT or captive RIC to any member of the affiliated
      group that includes the corporation that  directly  or  indirectly  owns
      over  fifty  percent  of the voting stock of the captive REIT or captive
      RIC shall be limited to twenty-five percent for taxable years  beginning
      on  or  after January first, two thousand nine and before January first,
      two thousand eleven and shall not be allowed for taxable years beginning
      on or after January first, two thousand  eleven.  The  term  "affiliated
      group"  means  "affiliated  group" as defined in section fifteen hundred
      four of the internal revenue code, but without regard to the  exceptions
      provided for in subsection (b) of that section.
        * (4)  (i)  In  no  event  shall  an  item  of  income or expense of a
      corporation organized under the laws of a country other than the  United
      States  be  included  in  a  combined  return unless it is includible in
      entire net income or alternative entire net income, as the case may  be,
      nor  shall  an  asset  of  such  a corporation be included in a combined
      return unless it is included in taxable assets.
        (ii) In no event shall a corporation organized under the laws  of  the
      United  States, this state or any other state, be included in a combined
      return with a corporation organized under the laws of  a  country  other
      than the United States.
        (iii)  In  no  event  shall  a  corporation which has made an election
      pursuant to subdivision (d) of section 11-640 of this part to be subject
      to the tax imposed by subchapter two of this chapter be  included  in  a
      combined  return  for those taxable years for which it is subject to the
      tax imposed by subchapter two of this chapter.
    
        * NB Amended Ch. 298/85 § 45, language juxtaposed per Ch. 907/85 § 14
        * (5)  Tax  liability  under  this part may be deemed to be improperly
      reflected  because  of  intercompany  transactions  or  some  agreement,
      understanding, arrangement or transaction referred to in subdivision (g)
      of this section.
        * NB Added Ch. 298/85 § 45, language juxtaposed per Ch. 907/85 § 14
        * (g)  In case it shall appear to the commissioner of finance that any
      agreement, understanding or arrangement exists between the taxpayer  and
      any  other  corporation  or  any  person  or firm, whereby the activity,
      business, income or assets of the taxpayer within the city is improperly
      or inaccurately reflected, the commissioner of finance is authorized and
      empowered, in his discretion and in such manner as he may determine,  to
      adjust  items  of income or deductions in computing entire net income or
      alternative entire net income and to adjust assets, and to adjust wages,
      salaries and other personal service compensation, receipts  or  deposits
      in  computing  any  allocation percentage, provided only that entire net
      income or alternative entire net income be adjusted accordingly and that
      any asset directly traceable  to  the  elimination  of  any  receipt  be
      eliminated  from  assets  so  as  to  accurately  determine  the tax. If
      however, in the determination  of  the  commissioner  of  finance,  such
      adjustments  do  not,  or  cannot  effectively  provide for the accurate
      determination  of  the  tax,  the  commissioner  of  finance  shall   be
      authorized  to  require  the filing of a combined report by the taxpayer
      and any such other corporations. Where (1)  any  taxpayer  conducts  its
      activity  or  business under any agreement, arrangement or understanding
      in such manner as either directly or indirectly to benefit  its  members
      or  stockholders,  or  any of them, or any person or persons directly or
      indirectly interested in such activity or business, by entering into any
      transaction at more or less than  a  fair  price  which,  but  for  such
      agreement,  arrangement  or  understanding,  might  have  been  paid  or
      received therefor, or (2) any taxpayer enters into any transaction  with
      another  corporation  on such terms as to create an improper loss or net
      income, the commissioner of finance may include in the entire net income
      or alternative entire net income of the taxpayer the fair profits which,
      but for such agreement, arrangement or understanding, the taxpayer might
      have derived from such transaction.

Section 11-647 ::    
        
     
        § 11-647 Payment of tax. (a) To the extent the tax imposed for section
      11-639  of  this  part  shall  not have been previously paid pursuant to
      section 11-645:
        (1) such tax,  or  the  balance  thereof,  shall  be  payable  to  the
      commissioner of finance in full at the time its return is required to be
      filed, and
        (2)  such  tax,  or the balance thereof, imposed on any taxpayer which
      ceased to exercise its franchise or to be subject to the tax imposed  by
      this  part  shall  be payable to the commissioner of finance at the time
      the return is required to be filed, provided  such  tax  of  a  domestic
      corporation which continues to possess its franchise shall be subject to
      adjustment as the circumstances may require; all other taxes of any such
      taxpayer, which pursuant to the foregoing provisions of this subdivision
      would  otherwise  be  payable  subsequent  to  the  time  such return is
      required to be filed, shall nevertheless be payable at such time.
        (b) If the taxpayer, within the time prescribed by subdivision (c)  of
      section  11-646  of  this  part,  shall  have  applied  for an automatic
      extension of time to file its annual return and shall have paid  to  the
      commissioner  of  finance  on  or before the date of such application is
      filed an amount properly estimated as provided by said  subdivision  the
      only  amount  payable  in  addition  to the tax shall be interest at the
      underpayment rate set by the commissioner of finance pursuant to section
      11-687 of this chapter, or, if no rate is set, at the rate of seven  and
      one-half  percent per annum upon the amount by which the tax, or portion
      thereof payable on or before the date the  return  was  required  to  be
      filed,  exceeds  the  amount  so paid. For the purposes of the preceding
      sentence:
        (1) an amount so paid shall be deemed  properly  estimated  if  it  is
      either:  (i)  not  less  than  ninety  per  cent  of  the tax as finally
      determined, or (ii) not less than the tax shown on the taxpayer's return
      for the preceding taxable year, if such preceding  year  was  a  taxable
      year of twelve months; and
        (2) the time when a return is required to be filed shall be determined
      without regard to any extension of time for filing such return.
        (c)  The  commissioner  of finance may grant a reasonable extension of
      time for payment of any tax imposed by this part under  such  conditions
      as the commissioner deems just and proper.
