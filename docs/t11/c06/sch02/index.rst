      to  the provisions of section eight hundred eighty-three of the internal
      revenue code, (ii) income without the United  States  which  is  derived
      from  the  operation  of  aircraft,  and (iii) income without the United
      States which is of a type described in subdivision (a) of section  eight
      hundred  eighty-one  of  the  internal  revenue  code  except that it is
      derived from sources without the United States. Entire net income  shall
      include  income  described  in  clauses  (i),  (ii)  and  (iii)  of this
      subparagraph in the case of taxpayers  not  described  in  the  previous
      sentence.
        (2)  A  taxpayer  is qualified under this subparagraph if air carriers
      organized in the United States and operating in the foreign  country  or
      countries  in which the taxpayer has its major base of operations and in
      which it is organized, resident or headquartered (if  not  in  the  same
      country  as  its major base of operations) are not subject to any income
      tax or other tax based on or measured by income or receipts  imposed  by
      such  foreign country or countries or any political subdivision thereof,
      or if so subject to such tax, are provided an exemption  from  such  tax
      equivalent to that provided for herein.
        (d)  The  commissioner  of  finance  may,  whenever necessary in order
      properly to reflect the entire net income of any taxpayer, determine the
      year or period in which  any  item  of  income  or  deduction  shall  be
      included,  without  regard  to  the method of accounting employed by the
      taxpayer;
        (e) The entire net income of any bridge commission created by  act  of
      congress  to  construct  a bridge across an international boundary means
      its gross income less the  expense  of  maintaining  and  operating  its
      properties,  the  annual  interest upon its bonds and other obligations,
      and the annual charge for the retirement of such bonds or obligations at
      maturity;
        (f) A net operating loss deduction shall be allowed which shall be the
      same as the net operating  loss  deduction  allowed  under  section  one
      hundred  seventy-two  of  the  internal revenue code or which would have
      been allowed if the taxpayer had not made an election under subchapter s
      of chapter one of the  internal  revenue  code,  except  that  in  every
      instance where such deduction is allowed under this subchapter:
        (1)  any  net  operating  loss  included in determining such deduction
      shall be adjusted to reflect the inclusions and exclusions  from  entire
      net income pursuant to paragraphs (a), (b), (g) and (h) hereof,
        (2) such deductions shall not include any net operating loss sustained
      during any taxable year in which the taxpayer was not subject to the tax
      imposed by this subchapter,
        (3) such deduction shall not exceed the deduction for the taxable year
      allowed  under  section  one hundred seventy-two of the internal revenue
      code, or the deduction for  the  taxable  year  which  would  have  been
      allowed  if  the taxpayer had not made an election under subchapter s of
      chapter one of the internal revenue code,
    
        (4) any net operating loss for a taxable year  beginning  in  nineteen
      hundred  eighty-one  shall  be  computed without regard to the deduction
      allowed with respect to recovery  property  under  section  one  hundred
      sixty-eight  of  the internal revenue code; in lieu of such deduction, a
      taxpayer  shall  be  allowed  for such taxable year with respect to such
      property the depreciation deduction allowable under section one  hundred
      sixty-seven of such code as such section was in full force and effect on
      December thirty-first, nineteen hundred eighty, and
        (5) the net operating loss deduction allowed under section one hundred
      seventy-two  of  the  internal  revenue  code shall for purposes of this
      paragraph be determined as  if  the  taxpayer  had  elected  under  such
      section  to  relinquish  the entire carryback period with respect to net
      operating losses, except with respect to the first ten thousand  dollars
      of each of such losses, sustained during taxable years ending after June
      thirtieth, nineteen hundred eighty-nine;
        (g)  At the election of the taxpayer, a deduction shall be allowed for
      expenditures  paid  or  incurred  during  the  taxable  year   for   the
      construction,  reconstruction,  erection  or  improvement  of industrial
      waste treatment facilities and air pollution control facilities.
        (1)(A) The term "industrial waste  treatment  facilities"  shall  mean
      facilities   for  the  treatment,  neutralization  or  stabilization  of
      industrial waste (as the term "industrial waste" is defined  in  section
      17-0105  of the environmental conservation law) from a point immediately
      preceding the point of such treatment, neutralization  or  stabilization
      to   the   point  of  disposal,  including  the  necessary  pumping  and
      transmitting facilities, but excluding such facilities installed for the
      primary  purpose  of  salvaging  materials  which  are  usable  in   the
      manufacturing process or are marketable.
        (B)  The term "air pollution control facilities" shall mean facilities
      which remove, reduce, or render less noxious  air  contaminants  emitted
      from  an  air  contamination  source (as the terms "air contaminant" and
      "air contamination  source"  are  defined  in  section  19-0107  of  the
      environmental  conservation  law) from a point immediately preceding the
      point of such removal, reduction or rendering to the point of  discharge
      of  air,  meeting emission standards as established by the air pollution
      control board, but excluding such facilities installed for  the  primary
      purpose  of  salvaging  materials  which are usable in the manufacturing
      process or are marketable and excluding those facilities which rely  for
      their   efficacy   on   dilution,  dispersion  or  assimilation  of  air
      contaminants in the ambient air after emission.
        (2) However, such deduction shall be allowed only (A) with respect  to
      tangible  property which is depreciable, pursuant to section one hundred
      sixty-seven of the internal revenue code, having a situs in the city and
      used  in  the  taxpayer's   trade   or   business,   the   construction,
      reconstruction,  erection  or  improvement  of  which,  in  the  case of
      industrial waste treatment facilities, is initiated on or after  January
      first,  nineteen  hundred  sixty-six,  and only for expenditures paid or
      incurred prior to January first, nineteen hundred seventy-two, or which,
      in the case of air pollution control  facilities,  is  initiated  on  or
      after January first, nineteen hundred sixty-six, and
        (B) on condition that such facilities have been certified by the state
      commissioner  of  environmental conservation or the state commissioner's
      designated representative, in the same manner as provided for in section
      17-0707 or 19-0309 of the environmental conservation law, as applicable,
      as  complying  with   applicable   provisions   of   the   environmental
      conservation  law,  the  state sanitary code and regulations, permits or
      orders issued pursuant thereto, and
    
        (C) on condition that entire net income for the taxable year  and  all
      succeeding  taxable  years  be  computed without any deductions for such
      expenditures or for depreciation of the same  property  other  than  the
      deductions  allowed  by this paragraph (g) except to the extent that the
      basis  of  the  property  may be attributable to factors other than such
      expenditures, or in case a  deduction  is  allowable  pursuant  to  this
      paragraph  for  only  a part of such expenditures, on condition that any
      deduction allowed for federal income tax purposes for such  expenditures
      or  for  depreciation of the same property be proportionately reduced in
      computing entire net income for the  taxable  year  and  all  succeeding
      taxable years, and
        (D)  where  the  election provided for in paragraph (d) of subdivision
      three of section 11-604 of this subchapter has  not  been  exercised  in
      respect to the same property.
        (3)(A)  If  expenditures  in  respect to an industrial waste treatment
      facility or an air pollution control  facility  have  been  deducted  as
      provided herein and if within ten (10) years from the end of the taxable
      year  in  which  such  deduction  was  allowed such property or any part
      thereof is used for the primary purpose of salvaging materials which are
      usable in the manufacturing process  or  are  marketable,  the  taxpayer
      shall report such change of use in its report for the first taxable year
      during  which  it  occurs, and the commissioner of finance may recompute
      the tax for the year or years for which such deduction was  allowed  and
      any  carryback  or  carryover  year,  and  may assess any additional tax
      resulting from such recomputation within the time fixed by paragraph (h)
      of subdivision three of section 11-674 of this chapter.
        (B) If a deduction is allowed as herein provided for expenditures paid
      or incurred during  any  taxable  year  on  the  basis  of  a  temporary
      certificate   of   compliance   issued  pursuant  to  the  environmental
      conservation law and  if  the  taxpayer  fails  to  obtain  a  permanent
      certificate of compliance upon completion of the facilities with respect
      to  which  such  temporary  certificate  was  issued, the taxpayer shall
      report such failure in its report for the taxable year during which such
      facilities are completed, and the commissioner of finance may  recompute
      the  tax  for the year or years for which such deduction was allowed and
      any carryback or carryover year,  and  may  assess  any  additional  tax
      resulting from such recomputation within the time fixed by paragraph (h)
      of subdivision three of section 11-674 of this chapter.
        (4)  In  any  taxable year when property is sold or otherwise disposed
      of, with respect to which a deduction has been allowed pursuant to  this
      paragraph,  such  deduction  shall  be  disregarded in computing gain or
      loss, and the gain or loss on the sale  or  other  disposition  of  such
      property  shall  be  the  gain  or loss entering into the computation of
      entire taxable income which the taxpayer is required to  report  to  the
      United States treasury for such taxable year;
        (h) With respect to gain derived from the sale or other disposition of
      any   property   acquired  prior  to  January  first,  nineteen  hundred
      sixty-six; which had a federal adjusted basis on such date  (or  on  the
      date  of  its sale or other disposition prior to January first, nineteen
      hundred sixty-six) lower than its fair market value  on  January  first,
      nineteen  hundred sixty-six or the date of its sale or other disposition
      prior thereto, except property described in subsections one and four  of
      section  twelve  hundred  twenty-one of the internal revenue code, there
      shall be deducted from entire net income, the difference between (1) the
      amount of the taxpayer's federal taxable income, and (2) the  amount  of
      the  taxpayer's  federal  taxable  income  (if  smaller  than the amount
      described in subparagraph one of  this  paragraph  computed  as  if  the
      federal  adjusted  basis  of  each  such  property (on the sale or other
    
      disposition of which gain was derived) on the date of the sale or  other
      disposition  had  been  equal  to  either  (A)  its fair market value on
      January first, nineteen hundred sixty-six or the date  of  its  sale  or
      other  disposition  prior  to January first, nineteen hundred sixty-six,
      plus or minus all  adjustments  to  basis  made  with  respect  to  such
      property  for  federal  income  tax  purposes  for  periods on and after
      January first, nineteen hundred sixty-six or  (B)  the  amount  realized
      from  its  sale  or  disposition, whichever is lower; provided, however,
      that the total modification provided by this  paragraph  (h)  shall  not
      exceed  the  amount  of  the  taxpayer's net gain from the sale or other
      disposition of all such property.
        (i) If the period covered by a report under this subchapter  is  other
      than  the  period  covered  by  the report of the United States treasury
      department, entire net income shall be  determined  by  multiplying  the
      federal  taxable  income (as adjusted pursuant to the provisions of this
      subchapter) by the number of calendar  months  or  major  parts  thereof
      covered  by  the report under this subchapter and dividing by the number
      of calendar months or major parts thereof covered by the report to  such
      department.
        If  it  shall appear that such method of determining entire net income
      does not properly  reflect  the  taxpayer's  income  during  the  period
      covered by the report under this subchapter, the commissioner of finance
      shall  be  authorized  in his or her discretion to determine such entire
      net income solely on the basis  of  the  taxpayer's  income  during  the
      period covered by its report under this subchapter.
        (j)  In  the  case  of  property  placed  in  service in taxable years
      beginning  before  nineteen  hundred  ninety-four,  for  taxable   years
      beginning  after  December  thirty-first,  nineteen  hundred eighty-one,
      except with respect to property subject to the provisions of section two
      hundred eighty-F of the internal revenue code and  property  subject  to
      the  provisions  of  section  one  hundred  sixty-eight  of the internal
      revenue code which is placed in service in this state in  taxable  years
      beginning after December thirty-first, nineteen hundred eighty-four, and
      provided  a  deduction  has  not  been  excluded  from entire net income
      pursuant to subparagraph nine of paragraph (b) of  this  subdivision,  a
      taxpayer  shall  be allowed with respect to property which is subject to
      the provisions of  section  one  hundred  sixty-eight  of  the  internal
      revenue  code  the  depreciation  deduction  allowable under section one
      hundred sixty-seven of the internal revenue code as such  section  would
      have  applied  to  property  placed in service on December thirty-first,
      nineteen hundred eighty. This paragraph shall not apply to property of a
      taxpayer principally engaged in the conduct of an  aviation,  steamboat,
      ferry  or  navigation business, or two or more of such businesses, which
      is placed in service before taxable years beginning in nineteen  hundred
      eighty-nine.
        (k)  for taxable years ending after September tenth, two thousand one,
      in the  case  of  qualified  property  described  in  paragraph  two  of
      subsection  k of section one hundred sixty-eight of the internal revenue
      code,  other  than  qualified  resurgence  zone  property  described  in
      paragraph  (m)  of  this  subdivision, and other than qualified New York
      Liberty Zone property described in paragraph  two  of  subsection  b  of
      section  fourteen hundred L of the internal revenue code (without regard
      to clause (i) of subparagraph (C) of such paragraph),  the  depreciation
      deduction  allowable  under  section  one  hundred  sixty-seven  as such
      section would have applied to such property had it been acquired by  the
      taxpayer  on  September tenth, two thousand one, provided, however, that
      for taxable years beginning on or  after  January  first,  two  thousand
      four,  in  the  case  of  a  passenger  motor vehicle or a sport utility
    
      vehicle subject to the provisions of paragraph (o) of this  subdivision,
      the  limitation under clause (i) of subparagraph (A) of paragraph one of
      subdivision (a) of section two hundred eighty F of the internal  revenue
      code  applicable  to  the  amount  allowed  as  a  deduction  under this
      paragraph shall be determined as of the date such vehicle was placed  in
      service and not as of September tenth, two thousand one.
        (l)  for taxable years ending after September tenth, two thousand one,
      upon the  disposition  of  property  to  which  paragraph  (k)  of  this
      subdivision applies, the amount of any gain or loss includible in entire
      net  income  shall  be adjusted to reflect the inclusions and exclusions
      from entire net income pursuant to subparagraph twelve of paragraph  (a)
      and   subparagraph   sixteen   of  paragraph  (b)  of  this  subdivision
      attributable to such property.
        (m) for purposes of  paragraphs  (l)  and  (m)  of  this  subdivision,
      qualified   resurgence  zone  property  shall  mean  qualified  property
      described in paragraph two  of  subsection  k  of  section  one  hundred
      sixty-eight of the internal revenue code substantially all of the use of
      which  is in the resurgence zone, as defined below, and is in the active
      conduct of a trade or business by the taxpayer in  such  zone,  and  the
      original use of which in the resurgence zone commences with the taxpayer
      after  September tenth, two thousand one. The resurgence zone shall mean
      the area of New York county bounded on the south by a line running  from
      the  intersection  of  the  Hudson  River  with  the Holland Tunnel, and
      running thence east to Canal Street, then running along  the  centerline
      of  Canal  Street  to  the  intersection of the Bowery and Canal Street,
      running thence in a southeasterly direction diagonally across  Manhattan
      Bridge  Plaza,  to the Manhattan Bridge, and thence along the centerline
      of the Manhattan Bridge  to  the  point  where  the  centerline  of  the
      Manhattan  Bridge  would  intersect  with  the easterly bank of the East
      River, and bounded on the north by a line running from the  intersection
      of  the  Hudson  River  with the Holland Tunnel and running thence north
      along West Avenue to the intersection of Clarkson  Street  then  running
      east  along  the  centerline  of  Clarkson Street to the intersection of
      Washington Avenue, then running south along the centerline of Washington
      Avenue to the intersection of West Houston Street, then east  along  the
      centerline  of  West  Houston  Street,  then  at the intersection of the
      Avenue of the Americas continuing east  along  the  centerline  of  East
      Houston Street to the easterly bank of the East River.
        (n)  Related  members  expense  add back. (1) Definitions. (A) Related
      member.  "Related  member"  means  a  related  person  as   defined   in
      subparagraph  (c)  of  paragraph three of subsection (b) of section four
      hundred sixty-five of the internal  revenue  code,  except  that  "fifty
      percent" shall be substituted for "ten percent".
        (B)  Effective  rate  of tax. "Effective rate of tax" means, as to any
      city, the maximum statutory rate of  tax  imposed  by  the  city  on  or
      measured   by   a   related   member's  net  income  multiplied  by  the
      apportionment percentage, if any, applicable to the related member under
      the laws of said jurisdiction. For  purposes  of  this  definition,  the
      effective  rate of tax as to any city is zero where the related member's
      net income tax liability in said city  is  reported  on  a  combined  or
      consolidated  return  including both the taxpayer and the related member
      where the reported transactions between the  taxpayer  and  the  related
      member  are eliminated or offset. Also, for purposes of this definition,
      when computing the effective rate of tax for a city in which  a  related
      member's  net  income  is  eliminated  or  offset by a credit or similar
      adjustment that is dependent upon the related member either  maintaining
      or  managing  intangible  property or collecting interest income in that
      city, the maximum statutory rate of tax imposed by said  city  shall  be
    
      decreased  to  reflect  the  statutory  rate  of tax that applies to the
      related  member  as  effectively  reduced  by  such  credit  or  similar
      adjustment.
        (C) Royalty payments. Royalty payments are payments directly connected
      to  the  acquisition,  use,  maintenance or management, ownership, sale,
      exchange, or any other disposition of licenses, trademarks,  copyrights,
      trade  names,  trade  dress,  service  marks, mask works, trade secrets,
      patents and any other similar types of intangible assets  as  determined
      by  the  commissioner  of  finance,  and  include  amounts  allowable as
      interest  deductions  under  section  one  hundred  sixty-three  of  the
      internal  revenue  code  to  the  extent  such  amounts  are directly or
      indirectly for, related to or in connection with the  acquisition,  use,
      maintenance  or  management, ownership, sale, exchange or disposition of
      such intangible assets.
        (D) Valid business purpose. A valid business purpose is  one  or  more
      business  purposes,  other  than the avoidance or reduction of taxation,
      which alone or in combination constitute the primary motivation for some
      business activity or transaction, which activity or transaction  changes
      in  a  meaningful  way, apart from tax effects, the economic position of
      the taxpayer. The economic position of the taxpayer includes an increase
      in the market share of the taxpayer, or the entry by the  taxpayer  into
      new business markets.
        (2) Royalty expense add backs. (A) For the purpose of computing entire
      net  income  or other applicable taxable basis, a taxpayer must add back
      royalty payments directly or indirectly paid, accrued,  or  incurred  in
      connection  with one or more direct or indirect transactions with one or
      more related members during the taxable year to the extent deductible in
      calculating federal taxable income.
        (B) Exceptions. (i) The adjustment required in  this  paragraph  shall
      not  apply  to  the  portion  of  the  royalty payment that the taxpayer
      establishes, by clear and convincing evidence of the  type  and  in  the
      form  specified  by  the  commissioner  of  finance,  meets  all  of the
      following requirements: (I) the related member was  subject  to  tax  in
      this  city  or another city within the United States or a foreign nation
      or some combination thereof on a tax  base  that  included  the  royalty
      payment  paid,  accrued  or  incurred  by the taxpayer; (II) the related
      member during the same taxable year directly or indirectly paid, accrued
      or incurred such portion to a person that is not a related  member;  and
      (III)  the  transaction  giving  rise to the royalty payment between the
      taxpayer and the related member was  undertaken  for  a  valid  business
      purpose.
        (ii)  The adjustment required in this paragraph shall not apply if the
      taxpayer establishes, by clear and convincing evidence of the  type  and
      in  the  form  specified  by  the commissioner of finance, that: (I) the
      related member was subject to tax on or measured by its  net  income  in
      this  city or another city within the United States, or some combination
      thereof; (II) the tax base for said tax  included  the  royalty  payment
      paid,  accrued  or  incurred  by  the  taxpayer; and (III) the aggregate
      effective  rate  of  tax  applied  to  the  related  member   in   those
      jurisdictions  is  no  less than eighty percent of the statutory rate of
      tax that applied to the taxpayer under section 11-604 of this subchapter
      for the taxable year.
        (iii) The adjustment required in this paragraph shall not apply if the
      taxpayer establishes, by clear and convincing evidence of the  type  and
      in  the  form  specified  by  the commissioner of finance, that: (I) the
      royalty payment was paid,  accrued  or  incurred  to  a  related  member
      organized under the laws of a country other than the United States; (II)
      the  related  member's  income  from  the  transaction  was subject to a
    
      comprehensive income tax treaty between  such  country  and  the  United
      States;  (III) the related member was subject to tax in a foreign nation
      on a tax base  that  included  the  royalty  payment  paid,  accrued  or
      incurred  by  the  taxpayer;  (IV)  the related member's income from the
      transaction was taxed in such country at an effective  rate  of  tax  at
      least  equal  to  that imposed by this city; and (V) the royalty payment
      was paid, accrued  or  incurred  pursuant  to  a  transaction  that  was
      undertaken  for a valid business purpose and using terms that reflect an
      arm's length relationship.
        (iv) The adjustment required in this paragraph shall not apply if  the
      taxpayer  and  the  commissioner  of  finance  agree  in  writing to the
      application or use  of  alternative  adjustments  or  computations.  The
      commissioner  of  finance  may,  in  his or her discretion, agree to the
      application or use of alternative adjustments or computations when he or
      she concludes that in the absence of such agreement the  income  of  the
      taxpayer would not be properly reflected.
        (o)  For  taxable  years  beginning  on  or  after  January first, two
      thousand four, in the case of a taxpayer that is not an eligible  farmer

      connection with such use of property, a corporation principally  engaged
      in  the  conduct  of  a  ferry business and operating between any of the

      capital stock of which is owned  by  a  municipal  corporation  of  this
      state,  shall  not  be  subject  to tax under this subchapter; provided,
      however, that any corporation, other  than  (1)  a  utility  corporation
      subject  to  the  supervision of the state department of public service,
      and (2) for taxable years  beginning  on  or  after  August  first,  two
      thousand two, a utility as defined in subdivision six of section 11-1101
      of  this  title,  which  is  subject to tax under chapter eleven of this
      title as a vendor of utility services shall be subject to tax under this
      subchapter, but in computing the tax imposed by this section pursuant to
      the provisions of clause one of  subparagraph  (a)  of  paragraph  A  of
      subdivision one of section 11-604, business income allocated to the city
      pursuant  to paragraph (a) of subdivision three of such section shall be
      reduced by the  percentage  which  such  corporation's  gross  operating
      income subject to tax under chapter eleven of this title is of its gross
      operating income.
        (b)  The  term "gross operating income", when used in paragraph (a) of
      this subdivision, means  receipts  received  in  or  by  reason  of  any
      transaction had and consummated in the city, including cash, credits and

      delivery costs or any other costs whatsoever, interest or discount  paid
      or any other expenses whatsoever.
        (c)  If  it  shall  appear  to  the  commissioner  of finance that the
      application of the proviso of paragraph (a) of  this  subdivision,  does
      not  fairly and equitably reflect the portion of the taxpayer's business
      income  allocable  to  the  city  which  is  attributable  to  its  city
      activities  which are not taxable under subchapter two of chapter eleven
      of this title, the commissioner may prescribe other means or methods  of
      determining  such portion, including the use of the books and records of
      the taxpayer, if the commissioner finds that such means or methods  used
      in keeping them fairly and equitably reflect such portion.
        5.  The  tax  imposed  by  subdivision  one  of this section, with the
      modifications provided by subdivision six of this  section,  is  imposed
      for each calendar or fiscal year beginning with calendar or fiscal years
      ending in or with the calendar year nineteen hundred sixty-six.
        6.  (a)  The  tax  for  any  taxable  year  ending  prior  to December
      thirty-first, nineteen hundred sixty-six shall be an amount equal to the
      tax imposed by subdivision one of this section for  such  taxable  year,
    
      multiplied  by  the number of months (or major portions thereof) in such
      taxable year which occur after December thirty-first,  nineteen  hundred
      sixty-five  and  divided  by  the  number  of  months (or major portions
      thereof) in such taxable year.
        (b)  In  lieu  of  the  method  of  computation  of  tax prescribed in
      paragraph (a) of this subdivision, if the taxpayer  maintained  adequate
      records  for  the  portion  of any taxable year ending prior to December
      thirty-first, nineteen hundred sixty-six, which portion falls within the
      calendar year nineteen hundred sixty-six, it may elect  to  compute  the
      tax  for such taxable year by determining entire net income on the basis
      of the entire taxable income which it would have  reported  for  federal
      income  tax  purposes  had  it  filed  a federal income tax return for a
      taxable year beginning January first,  nineteen  hundred  sixty-six  and
      ending  with  the close of its actual taxable year and such taxable year
      beginning January first, nineteen hundred sixty-six, shall be deemed  to
      be  the  period covered by its report, except that in computing such tax
      any portion of  a  capital  loss  which  results  from  a  capital  loss
      carryover  and any net operating loss deduction, as modified pursuant to
      paragraph (f) of subdivision eight of section 11-602 of this subchapter,
      shall be reduced by the same part of such portion of such  capital  loss
      or  of  such  net  operating  loss deduction (as the case may be) as the
      number of months  (or  major  portions  thereof)  in  the  taxable  year
      occurring  before  January  first,  nineteen hundred sixty-six is of the
      number of months (or major portions thereof) in such taxable year.
        7. For any taxable year of a real estate investment trust  as  defined
      in section eight hundred fifty-six of the internal revenue code in which
      such  trust  is  subject  to federal income taxation under section eight
      hundred fifty-seven of such code, such trust shall be subject to  a  tax
      computed  under  either clause one of subparagraph (a) of paragraph A of
      subdivision one of section 11-604 of this subchapter with respect to its

      be subject to any tax under subchapter three of this chapter, except for
      a  captive REIT required to file a combined return under subdivision (f)
      of section 11-646 of this chapter. In the case of  such  a  real  estate
      investment  trust, including a captive REIT as defined in section 11-601
      of this chapter,  the  term  "entire  net  income"  means  "real  estate
      investment  trust  taxable  income"  as  defined  in  paragraph  two  of
      subdivision (b) of section eight hundred  fifty-seven  (as  modified  by
      section eight hundred fifty-eight) of the internal revenue code plus the
      amount taxable under paragraph three of subdivision (b) of section eight
      hundred  fifty-seven  of such code, subject to the modification required
      by subdivision eight of section 11-602 of this  subchapter  (other  than
      the  modification  required  by  clause  two  of  paragraph  (a)  and by
      paragraph  (f)  thereof)  including  the   modifications   required   by
      paragraphs  (d)  and  (e) of subdivision three of section 11-604 of this
      subchapter.
        8. For any taxable year beginning on or after January first,  nineteen
      hundred  eighty-one  of  a  regulated  investment company, as defined in
      section eight hundred fifty-one of the internal revenue code,  in  which
      such  company  is subject to federal income taxation under section eight
      hundred fifty-two of such code, such company shall be subject to  a  tax
      computed  under clause one or four of subparagraph (a) of paragraph E of

      subchapter three of this chapter, except for a captive RIC  required  to

      "entire  net  income"  used  in  subdivision  one  of this section means

      subdivision  (b)  of  section  eight  hundred  fifty-two, as modified by
      section  eight hundred fifty-five, of the internal revenue code plus the
      amount taxable under paragraph three of subdivision (b) of section eight
      hundred fifty-two of such code subject to the modifications required  by
      subdivision  eight  of section 11-602 of this subchapter, other than the
      modification required by clause two of paragraph (a)  and  by  paragraph
      (f)  thereof,  including the modification required by paragraphs (d) and
      (e) of subdivision three of section 11-604 of this subchapter.
        9. For any taxable year beginning on or after January first,  nineteen
      hundred  eighty-seven,  an  organization  described  in paragraph two or
      twenty-five of subdivision (c)  of  section  five  hundred  one  of  the
      Internal  Revenue  Code  of  nineteen hundred eighty-six shall be exempt
      from all taxes imposed by this chapter.

      provided in paragraph B, and the tax for each such year shall be the sum
      of that proportion of each tentative tax which the  number  of  days  in
      nineteen hundred seventy-four and the number of days in nineteen hundred
      seventy-five,  respectively,  bears  to the number of days in the entire
      taxable year.
        D. For taxable years beginning on or  after  January  first,  nineteen
      hundred   seventy-seven  and  before  January  first,  nineteen  hundred
      seventy-eight, the tax imposed by subdivision one of section  11-603  of
      this  subchapter  shall  be, in the case of each taxpayer: (a) a tax (1)
      computed at the rate of nine and one-half per centum of its  entire  net
      income,  or  the  portion of such entire net income allocated within the
      city as hereinafter provided, subject to any  modification  required  by
      paragraphs  (d)  and  (e)  of  subdivision three of this section, or (2)
      computed at one and one-half mills for each dollar of its total business
      and investment capital, or the  portion  thereof  allocated  within  the
      city,  as hereinafter provided, except that in the case of a cooperative
      housing corporation  as  defined  in  the  internal  revenue  code,  the
    
      applicable rate shall be four-tenths of one mill, or (3) computed at the
      rate  of  nine  and  one-half  per  centum  on  thirty per centum of the
      taxpayer's entire net income plus salaries and other  compensation  paid
      to the taxpayer's elected or appointed officers and to every stockholder
      owning  in  excess  of five per centum of its issued capital stock minus
      fifteen thousand dollars (except as hereinafter provided)  and  any  net
      loss  for the reported year, or on the portion of any such sum allocated
      within the city as hereinafter provided for the allocation of entire net
      income, subject to any modification required by paragraphs (d)  and  (e)
      of  subdivision  three  of  this section, or (4) one hundred twenty-five
      dollars, whichever is greatest, plus (b) a tax computed at the  rate  of
      three-quarters  of  a  mill  for  each  dollar  of  the  portion  of its
      subsidiary capital allocated within the city as hereinafter provided. In
      the case of a taxpayer which is not subject to tax for an  entire  year,
      the exemption allowed in clause three of paragraph (a) shall be prorated
      according to the period such taxpayer was subject to tax.
        E.  For  taxable  years  beginning on or after January first, nineteen
      hundred seventy-eight but before January first,  two  thousand  fifteen,
      the  tax imposed by subdivision one of section 11-603 of this subchapter
      shall be, in the case of each taxpayer:
        (a) whichever of the following amounts is the greatest:
        (1) an amount computed, for taxable years  beginning  before  nineteen
      hundred  eighty-seven,  at  the rate of nine per centum, and for taxable
      years beginning after nineteen hundred eighty-six, at the rate of  eight
      and  eighty-five  one-hundredths per centum, of its entire net income or
      the portion of such entire net  income  allocated  within  the  city  as
      hereinafter provided, subject to any modification required by paragraphs
      (d) and (e) of subdivision three of this section,
        (2)  an  amount  computed at one and one-half mills for each dollar of
      its total business  and  investment  capital,  or  the  portion  thereof
      allocated  within  the city, as hereinafter provided, except that in the
      case of a cooperative housing corporation as  defined  in  the  internal
      revenue code, the applicable rate shall be four-tenths of one mill,
        (3)  an  amount  computed, for taxable years beginning before nineteen
      hundred eighty-seven, at the rate of nine per centum,  and  for  taxable
      years  beginning after nineteen hundred eighty-six, at the rate of eight
      and eighty-five one-hundredths per centum, on thirty per centum  of  the
      taxpayer's  entire  net income plus salaries and other compensation paid
      to the taxpayer's elected or appointed officers and to every stockholder
      owning in excess of five per centum of its issued  capital  stock  minus
      fifteen  thousand dollars (subject to proration as hereinafter provided)
      and any net loss for the reported year, or on the portion  of  any  such
      sum allocated within the city as hereinafter provided for the allocation
      of entire net income, subject to any modification required by paragraphs
      (d)  and  (e)  of  subdivision three of this section, provided, however,
      that for taxable years  beginning  on  or  after  July  first,  nineteen
      hundred  ninety-six,  the  provisions of paragraph H of this subdivision
      shall apply for purposes of the computation under this clause, or
        (4) for taxable years ending on or  before  June  thirtieth,  nineteen
      hundred  eighty-nine, one hundred twenty-five dollars, for taxable years
      ending after June thirtieth, nineteen hundred eighty-nine and  beginning
      before  two  thousand nine, three hundred dollars, and for taxable years
      beginning after two thousand eight:
          If New York city receipts are:          Fixed dollar minimum tax is:
        Not more than $100,000                              $25
        More than $100,000 but not over $250,000            $75
        More than $250,000 but not over $500,000            $175
        More than $500,000 but not over $1,000,000          $500
    
        More than $1,000,000 but not over $5,000,000        $1,500
        More than $5,000,000 but not over $25,000,000       $3,500
        Over $25,000,000                                    $5,000
      For  purposes  of  this  clause, New York city receipts are the receipts
      computed in  accordance  with  subparagraph  two  of  paragraph  (a)  of
      subdivision  three  of  this  section  for the taxable year. For taxable
      years beginning after two thousand eight, if the taxable  year  is  less
      than  twelve  months,  the  amount  prescribed  by  this clause shall be
      reduced by twenty-five percent if the period for which the  taxpayer  is
      subject to tax is more than six months but not more than nine months and
      by  fifty percent if the period for which the taxpayer is subject to tax
      is not more than six months. If the taxable year  is  less  than  twelve
      months, the amount of New York city receipts for purposes of this clause
      is  determined  by  dividing  the amount of the receipts for the taxable
      year by the number of months in the taxable  year  and  multiplying  the
      result by twelve, plus;
        (b)  an  amount  computed  at the rate of three-quarters of a mill for
      each dollar of the portion of its subsidiary  capital  allocated  within
      the city as hereinafter provided.
        In  the  case  of a taxpayer which is not subject to tax for an entire
      year, the exemption allowed in clause three of subparagraph (a) of  this
      paragraph  shall  be  prorated according to the period such taxpayer was
      subject to tax. Provided, however, that this paragraph shall  not  apply
      to  taxable  years  beginning  after December thirty-first, two thousand
      fourteen. For the taxable years specified in the preceding sentence, the
      tax imposed by subdivision one of  section  11-603  of  this  subchapter
      shall  be,  in  the  case  of  each taxpayer, determined as specified in
      paragraph A of this subdivision, provided, however, that the  provisions
      of  paragraphs  G  and H of this subdivision shall apply for purposes of
      the computation under clause three of subparagraph (a) of such paragraph
      A.
        F. Notwithstanding any other provision  of  this  subdivision  to  the
      contrary,   for   taxable   years   beginning   after  nineteen  hundred
      eighty-seven and before two thousand nine the amount of tax computed  on
      the  basis  of  the taxpayer's total business and investment capital, or
      the portion thereof allocated within the city, shall in no event  exceed
      three  hundred  fifty  thousand  dollars and for taxable years beginning
      after two thousand eight the amount of tax computed on the basis of  the
      taxpayer's total business and investment capital, or the portion thereof
      allocated within the city, shall in no event exceed one million dollars.
        G.  In  the  case  of  a  foreign  air  carrier described in the first
      sentence of subparagraph one of paragraph (c-1) of subdivision eight  of
      section  11-602  of  this  subchapter,  there shall be excluded from the
      computation of the  tax  under  clause  three  of  subparagraph  (a)  of
      paragraph   E  of  this  subdivision  salaries  and  other  compensation
      described therein which are directly attributable to the  generation  of
      income  excluded from entire net income for the taxable year pursuant to
      the provisions of paragraph (c-1) of subdivision eight of section 11-602
      of this subchapter.
        H. For taxable years  beginning  on  or  after  July  first,  nineteen
      hundred  ninety-six,  the computation under clause three of subparagraph
      (a) of paragraph E of this subdivision shall be subject to the following
      modifications:
        (a) (1) For taxable years beginning on or after July  first,  nineteen
      hundred ninety-six but before July first, nineteen hundred ninety-eight,
      only  seventy-five  percent of the total salaries and other compensation
      paid to the taxpayer's elected or appointed officers shall be  added  to
      the  entire net income entering into such computation; for taxable years
    
      beginning on or after July  first,  nineteen  hundred  ninety-eight  but
      before  July  first, nineteen hundred ninety-nine, only fifty percent of
      such salaries and other compensation shall be added to such  entire  net
      income; and for taxable years beginning on or after July first, nineteen
      hundred  ninety-nine,  no  part  of such salaries and other compensation
      shall be added to such entire net income.
        (2) Notwithstanding anything in clause one of this subparagraph to the
      contrary, the full amount of the salary or other  compensation  paid  to
      any  such  elected  or  appointed  officer  shall be added to entire net
      income as provided in clause three of subparagraph (a) of paragraph E of
      this subdivision if such officer was, at any  time  during  the  taxable
      year,  a  stockholder owning more than five percent of taxpayer's issued
      capital stock.
        (b) For taxable years beginning  on  or  after  July  first,  nineteen
      hundred   ninety-seven   but   before   July   first,  nineteen  hundred
      ninety-eight, the fixed dollar  amount  entering  into  the  computation
      under   clause  three  of  subparagraph  (a)  of  paragraph  E  of  this
      subdivision shall be thirty thousand dollars instead of fifteen thousand
      dollars; and for  taxable  years  beginning  on  or  after  July  first,
      nineteen  hundred  ninety-eight, such fixed dollar amount shall be forty
      thousand dollars.
        (c) For taxable  years  beginning  on  or  after  January  first,  two
      thousand  seven  and  before  January  first, two thousand eight the per
      centum entering into the computation under clause three of  subparagraph
      (a)  of  paragraph  E  of  this  subdivision  shall  be  twenty-six  and
      one-fourth per centum instead of thirty per centum,  for  taxable  years
      beginning  on  or  after  January  first,  two thousand eight and before
      January first, two thousand nine such per centum shall be twenty-two and
      one-half per centum, for taxable years beginning  on  or  after  January
      first, two thousand nine and before January first, two thousand ten such
      per  centum  shall  be  eighteen  and  three-fourths  per centum and for
      taxable years beginning on or after January first, two thousand ten such
      per centum shall be fifteen per centum.
        I. Notwithstanding any provision of this subdivision to the  contrary,
      for  taxable  years  beginning  on  or after January first, two thousand
      seven for any corporation that:
        (a) has a business allocation percentage  for  the  taxable  year,  as
      determined  under paragraph (a) of subdivision three of this section, of
      one hundred percent;
        (b) has no investment capital or income at any time during the taxable
      year;
        (c) has no subsidiary capital or income at any time during the taxable
      year; and
        (d) has gross income, as defined in section sixty-one of the  internal
      revenue  code,  less  than  two  hundred  fifty thousand dollars for the
      taxable year:
        the  tax  imposed  by  subdivision  one  of  section  11-603  of  this
      subchapter shall be the greater of the tax on entire net income computed
      under  clause one of subparagraph (a) of paragraph E of this subdivision
      and  the  fixed  dollar  minimum  tax  specified  in  clause   four   of
      subparagraph (a) of paragraph E of this subdivision.
        For  purposes of this paragraph, any corporation for which an election
      under subsection (a) of section six hundred sixty of the tax law is  not
      in  effect  for the taxable year may elect to treat as entire net income
      the sum of:
        (i) entire net income as determined under section two hundred eight of
      the tax law; and
    
        (ii) any deductions taken for the taxable year  in  computing  federal
      taxable  income  for  New  York  city  taxes  paid or accrued under this
      chapter.
        2.  The  amount of subsidiary capital, investment capital and business
      capital shall each be determined by taking  the  average  value  of  the
      gross  assets  included  therein  (less liabilities deductible therefrom
      pursuant to the provisions  of  subdivisions  three,  four  and  six  of
      section  11-602  of  this subchapter), and, if the period covered by the
      report is other than a period of twelve calendar months, by  multiplying
      such  value  by  the  number  of  calendar months or major parts thereof
      included in such period, and  dividing  the  product  thus  obtained  by
      twelve.  For  purposes of this subdivision, real property and marketable
      securities shall be valued  at  fair  market  value  and  the  value  of
      personal  property  other  than marketable securities shall be the value
      thereof shown on the books and records of  the  taxpayer  in  accordance
      with generally accepted accounting principles.
        3.  The portion of the entire net income of a taxpayer to be allocated
      within the city shall be determined as follows:
        (a) multiply its business income by a business  allocation  percentage
      to be determined by:
        (1)  ascertaining  the  percentage  which  the  average  value  of the
      taxpayer's real and tangible personal property, whether owned or  rented
      to  it, within the city during the period covered by its report bears to
      the average value of all  the  taxpayer's  real  and  tangible  personal
      property,  whether  owned or rented to it, wherever situated during such
      period. For the purpose of this subparagraph, the  term  "value  of  the
      taxpayer's  real and tangible personal property" shall mean the adjusted
      bases of such properties for federal income tax purposes (except that in
      the case of rented property such value shall mean  the  product  of  (A)
      eight  and  (B)  the gross rents payable for the rental of such property
      during the taxable year); provided, however, that the taxpayer may  make
      a  one-time,  revocable election, pursuant to regulations promulgated by
      the commissioner of finance to use fair market value as the value of all
      of its real and tangible personal property, provided that such  election
      is  made  on  or  before  the due date for filing a report under section
      11-605  of  this  subchapter  for  the  taxpayer's  first  taxable  year
      commencing  on or after January first, nineteen hundred eighty-eight and
      provided that such election shall not apply to  any  taxable  year  with
      respect  to  which  the taxpayer is included on a combined report unless
      each of the taxpayers included on such report has made such an  election
      which remains in effect for such year;
        (2)  ascertaining  the  percentage which the receipts of the taxpayer,
      computed on the cash  or  accrual  basis  according  to  the  method  of
      accounting  used  in  the  computation of its entire net income, arising
      during such period from:
        (A)  except  as  otherwise  provided  in  subparagraph  nine  of  this
      paragraph,  sales  of its tangible personal property where shipments are
      made to points within the city,
        (B) services performed within the city, provided, however, that (i) in
      the case of a taxpayer engaged in the business of publishing  newspapers
      or  periodicals, receipts arising from sales of advertising contained in
      such newspapers and periodicals shall be deemed to arise  from  services
      performed  within  the  city  to  the  extent  that  such newspapers and
      periodicals are delivered to  points  within  the  city,  (ii)  receipts
      received from an investment company arising from the sale of management,
      administration or distribution services to such investment company shall
      be deemed to arise from services performed within the city to the extent
      set  forth  in subparagraph five of this paragraph, (iii) in the case of
    
      taxpayers principally engaged in the activity of air freight  forwarding
      acting  as  principal  and  like indirect air carriage, receipts arising
      from such activity shall be deemed  to  arise  from  services  performed
      within the city as follows: one hundred percent of such receipts if both
      the  pickup  and  delivery associated with such receipts are made in the
      city and fifty percent of such receipts if either the pickup or delivery
      associated with such receipts is made in  the  city,  (iv)  for  taxable
      years beginning on or after January first, two thousand two, in the case
      of  a  taxpayer  engaged  in  the  business  of publishing newspapers or
      periodicals, or  broadcasting  radio  or  television  programs,  whether
      through  the  public  airwaves or by cable, direct or indirect satellite
      transmission, or any other means of transmission, receipts arising  from
      sales  of  subscriptions, advertising or broadcasting shall be deemed to
      arise from services performed within the city to the extent provided  in
      subparagraph nine of this paragraph, and (v) for taxable years beginning
      after  two  thousand  eight,  in  the  case  of  a  taxpayer  which is a
      registered securities or commodities  broker  or  dealer,  the  receipts
      specified in subparagraph ten of this paragraph shall be deemed to arise
      from  services performed within the city to the extent set forth in such
      subparagraph ten,
        (C) rentals from property situated  and  royalties  from  the  use  of
      patents or copyrights, within the city, and
        (D)  all  other  business receipts earned within the city, bear to the
      total amount of the taxpayer's  receipts,  similarly  computed,  arising
      during  such  period  from  all sales of its tangible personal property,
      services,  rentals,  royalties  and  all  other  business  transactions,
      whether within or without the city;
        (3) ascertaining the percentage of the total wages, salaries and other
      personal service compensation, similarly computed, during such period of
      employees  within  the  city,  except general executive officers, to the
      total wages, salaries and other personal service compensation, similarly
      computed, during such period of all the taxpayer's employees within  and
      without the city, except general executive officers, and
        (4)  adding  together  the  percentages so determined and dividing the
      result by the number of percentages; provided, however, that for taxable
      years beginning on or after July first, nineteen hundred  ninety-six,  a
      taxpayer   that   is   a  "manufacturing  corporation,"  as  defined  in
      subparagraph  eight  of  this  paragraph,  may  determine  its  business
      allocation  percentage  as  provided  in  such  subparagraph  eight; and
      provided, further, however, that for taxable years beginning before July
      first, nineteen hundred ninety-six, if the  taxpayer  does  not  have  a
      regular  place  of  business  outside  the  city  other than a statutory
      office, the business allocation percentage  shall  be  one  hundred  per
      centum.
        (5)  Rules for receipts from certain services to investment companies.
      (A) For purposes of subclause (ii) of clause (B) of subparagraph two  of
      this  paragraph,  the  portion  of  receipts received from an investment
      company  arising  from  the  sale  of  management,   administration   or
      distribution   services   to   such  investment  company  determined  in
      accordance with clause (B) of this subparagraph shall be deemed to arise
      from services performed within the city (such portion referred to herein
      as the New York city portion).
        (B) The New York city portion shall be the product of (a) the total of
      such receipts from the sale of such services and  (b)  a  fraction.  The
      numerator  of  that  fraction  is the sum of the monthly percentages (as
      defined  hereinafter)  determined  for  each  month  of  the  investment
      company's  taxable  year  for  federal income tax purposes which taxable
      year ends within the taxable year of the  taxpayer  (but  excluding  any
    
      month  during  which  the investment company had no outstanding shares).
      The monthly percentage for each such month is determined by dividing (a)
      the number of shares in the investment company which are  owned  on  the
      last day of the month by shareholders which are domiciled in the city by
      (b)  the total number of shares in the investment company outstanding on
      that date. The denominator of the fraction is the number of such monthly
      percentages.
        (C) (i) For purposes of this subparagraph, the term "domicile", in the
      case of an individual, shall have  the  meaning  ascribed  to  it  under
      chapter  seventeen of this title; an estate or trust is domiciled in the
      city if it is a city resident estate or trust as  defined  in  paragraph
      three  of  subdivision  (b)  of section 11-1705 of this code; a business
      entity is domiciled in the city if the location of the  actual  seat  of
      management  or  control  is  in  the city. It shall be presumed that the
      domicile of a shareholder, with respect to any month, is his, her or its
      mailing address on the records of the investment company as of the  last
      day of such month.
        (ii)  For purposes of this subparagraph, the term "investment company"
      means a regulated investment company, as defined in section 851  of  the
      internal revenue code, and a partnership to which section 7704(a) of the
      internal  revenue  code applies (by virtue of section 7704(c)(3) of such
      code) and that meets the requirements of section 851(b)  of  such  code.
      The  preceding sentence shall be applied to the taxable year for federal
      income  tax  purposes  of  the  business  entity  that  is  asserted  to
      constitute  an  investment  company that ends within the taxable year of
      the taxpayer.
        (iii) For purposes of this subparagraph, the term  "receipts  from  an
      investment   company"   includes   amounts  received  directly  from  an
      investment company as well as amounts received from the shareholders  in
      such investment company in their capacity as such.
        (iv) For purposes of this subparagraph, the term "management services"
      means  the  rendering  of  investment  advice  to an investment company,
      making determinations as to when sales and purchases of  securities  are
      to  be  made  on  behalf  of  an  investment  company, or the selling or
      purchasing of securities constituting assets of an  investment  company,
      and  related  activities, but only where such activity or activities are
      performed pursuant to a contract with  the  investment  company  entered
      into  pursuant to section 15(a) of the federal investment company act of
      nineteen hundred forty, as amended.
        (v)  For  purposes  of  this  subparagraph,  the  term   "distribution
      services" means the services of advertising, servicing investor accounts
      (including  redemptions),  marketing  shares  or  selling  shares  of an
      investment company, but, in the case of advertising, servicing  investor
      accounts  (including  redemptions)  or marketing shares, only where such
      service is performed by a person who is (or was, in the case of a closed
      end company) also engaged in the service of selling such shares. In  the
      case  of  an  open  end  company, such service of selling shares must be
      performed pursuant to a contract entered into pursuant to section  15(b)
      of  the  federal  investment  company  act of nineteen hundred forty, as
      amended.
        (vi) For purposes  of  this  subparagraph,  the  term  "administration
      services"   includes   (1)   clerical,   accounting,  bookkeeping,  data
      processing, internal auditing, legal and tax services performed  for  an
      investment  company  but  only  (2)  if  the provider of such service or
      services during the taxable year in which such service or  services  are
      sold   also  sells  management  or  distribution  services,  as  defined
      hereinabove, to such investment company.
    
        (6) (A)  Provided,  further,  however,  that  a  taxpayer  principally
      engaged in the conduct of aviation (other than as provided in clause (C)
      of this subparagraph) shall, notwithstanding the foregoing provisions of
      this  paragraph,  determine  the  portion  of  entire  net  income to be
      allocated  within  the  city  by  multiplying  its  business income by a
      business allocation percentage which is equal to the arithmetic  average
      of the following three percentages:
        (i)  the  percentage  determined  by  dividing  aircraft  arrivals and
      departures within the city by the taxpayer during the period covered  by
      its  report  by  the  total  aircraft arrivals and departures within and
      without the city during such period;  provided,  however,  arrivals  and
      departures  solely  for  maintenance  or  repair,  refueling  (where  no
      debarkation or embarkation of traffic occurs), arrivals  and  departures
      of  ferry  and  personnel training flights or arrivals and departures in
      the event of emergency situations shall not  be  included  in  computing
      such   arrival   and   departure   percentage;  provided,  further,  the
      commissioner of finance may also exempt from  such  percentage  aircraft
      arrivals  and  departures  of  all non-revenue flights including flights
      involving the transportation of  officers  or  employees  receiving  air
      transportation  to  perform maintenance or repair services or where such
      officers or employees are transported in conjunction with  an  emergency
      situation  or  the  investigation  of  an  air disaster (other than on a
      scheduled flight); provided, however, that arrivals  and  departures  of
      flights transporting officers and employees receiving air transportation
      for purposes other than specified above (without regard to remuneration)
      shall be included in computing such arrival and departure percentage;
        (ii) the percentage determined by dividing the revenue tons handled by
      the taxpayer at airports within the city during such period by the total
      revenue  tons  handled  by  it  at  airports within and without the city
      during such period; and
        (iii) the percentage determined by dividing the taxpayer's originating
      revenue within the city for such period by its total originating revenue
      within and without the city for such period.
        (B) As used herein, the term "aircraft arrivals and departures"  means
      the  number of landings and takeoffs of the aircraft of the taxpayer and
      the number of air  pickups  and  deliveries  by  the  aircraft  of  such
      taxpayer;  the  term "originating revenue" means revenue to the taxpayer
      from the transportation of revenue passengers and revenue property first
      received by the taxpayer either as originating or connecting traffic  at
      airports;  and  the  term  "revenue  tons  handled"  by  the taxpayer at
      airports means the weight in tons of revenue passengers (at two  hundred
      pounds  per  passenger)  and  revenue  cargo  first  received  either as
      originating or connecting traffic or finally discharged by the  taxpayer
      at airports;
        (C)  A  foreign  air  carrier  described  in  the  first  sentence  of
      subparagraph one of paragraph (c-1)  of  subdivision  eight  of  section
      11-602  of  this  subchapter  shall  determine  its  business allocation
      percentage pursuant to the provisions of subparagraphs one through  four
      of  this paragraph, except that the numerators and denominators involved
      in such computation shall exclude property to  the  extent  employed  in
      generating  income  excluded  from  entire  net  income  pursuant to the
      provisions of paragraph (c-1) of subdivision eight of section 11-602  of
      this  subchapter,  exclude such receipts as are excluded from entire net
      income for the taxable year pursuant  to  the  provisions  of  paragraph
      (c-1)  of  subdivision  eight  of section 11-602 of this subchapter, and
      exclude wages, salaries or other personal service compensation which are
      directly attributable to the generation of income excluded  from  entire
    
      net  income for the taxable year pursuant to the provisions of paragraph
      (c-1) of subdivision eight of section 11-602 of this subchapter.
        (7) Provided, further, however, that a taxpayer principally engaged in
      the operation of vessels shall, notwithstanding the foregoing provisions
      of  this  paragraph,  determine  the  portion of entire net income to be
      allocated within the city  by  multiplying  its  business  income  by  a
      business  allocation  percentage  determined  by  dividing the aggregate
      number of working days of the vessels it owns or leases  in  territorial
      waters  of  the  city  during  the  period  covered by its report by the
      aggregate number of working days of all the vessels it  owns  or  leases
      during such period.
        (8) (A)  For  taxable years beginning on or after July first, nineteen
      hundred ninety-six and before January  first,  two  thousand  eleven,  a
      manufacturing corporation may elect to determine its business allocation
      percentage   by   adding   together  the  percentages  determined  under
      subparagraphs one, two and three of this  paragraph  and  an  additional
      percentage  equal to the percentage determined under subparagraph two of
      this paragraph, and dividing the result by the number of percentages  so
      added together.
        (B) An election under this subparagraph must be made on a timely filed
      (determined  with  regard to extensions granted) original report for the
      taxable year. Once made for a  taxable  year,  such  election  shall  be
      irrevocable  for that taxable year. A separate election must be made for
      each taxable year. A manufacturing corporation that has failed  to  make
      an  election  as  provided in this clause shall be required to determine
      its business allocation percentage without regard to the  provisions  of
      this  subparagraph.  Notwithstanding  anything  in  this  clause  to the
      contrary,  the  commissioner  of  finance  may  permit  a  manufacturing
      corporation  to make or revoke an election under this subparagraph, upon
      such terms and conditions as the commissioner may prescribe,  where  the
      commissioner  determines  that  such permission should be granted in the
      interests of fairness and  equity  due  to  a  change  in  circumstances
      resulting from an audit adjustment.
        (C) As used in this subparagraph, the term "manufacturing corporation"
      means  a  corporation  primarily  engaged  in the manufacturing and sale
      thereof of tangible personal  property;  and  the  term  "manufacturing"
      includes the process (including the assembly process) (i) of working raw
      materials  into  wares  suitable for use or (ii) which gives new shapes,
      new qualities or new combinations  to  matter  which  already  has  gone
      through  some  artificial  process,  by  the  use  of  machinery, tools,
      appliances and other similar equipment. A corporation shall be deemed to
      be primarily engaged  in  the  activities  described  in  the  preceding
      sentence  if  more  than  fifty  percent  of  its gross receipts for the
      taxable year are attributable to such activities.
        (D) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary, if a  taxpayer  that  is
      otherwise  eligible to make the election authorized by this subparagraph
      is required or permitted to make a report on a combined basis  with  one
      or  more  other  corporations  pursuant  to  subdivision four of section
      11-605 of this chapter, the taxpayer  shall  be  permitted  to  make  an
      election  under  this  subparagraph only if such taxpayer and such other
      corporation or corporations would be a manufacturing corporation if they
      were treated as a single  corporation.  In  making  such  determination,
      intercorporate transactions shall be eliminated. Where such election has
      been  made  by  the  taxpayer  for  a  taxable  year,  each of the other
      corporations included in the combined report shall  also  be  deemed  to
      have  made  a  proper  election under this subparagraph for such taxable
      year.
    
        (9) Special rules for publishers and broadcasters. (A) Notwithstanding
      anything in subparagraph two of  this  paragraph  to  the  contrary  and
      except  as provided in clause (C) of this subparagraph, in the case of a
      taxpayer  engaged  in  the  business   of   publishing   newspapers   or
      periodicals,  there  shall  be  allocated  to  the city, for purposes of
      subparagraph two of this paragraph,  the  gross  sales  or  charges  for
      services  arising from sales of advertising contained in such newspapers
      or periodicals, to the extent that such newspapers  or  periodicals  are
      delivered to points within the city.
        (B)  Notwithstanding anything in subparagraph two of this paragraph to
      the contrary and except as provided in clause (C) of this  subparagraph,
      in  the case of a taxpayer engaged in the business of broadcasting radio
      or television programs, whether through the public airwaves or by cable,
      direct or  indirect  satellite  transmission,  or  any  other  means  of
      transmission,  there  shall  be  allocated  to the city, for purposes of
      subparagraph two of this paragraph, a portion  of  the  gross  sales  or
      charges  for services arising from the broadcasting of such programs and
      of commercial messages in  connection  therewith,  such  portion  to  be
      determined  according  to  the number of listeners or viewers within and
      without the city.
        (C) Notwithstanding anything in clause (A) or (B) of this subparagraph
      to the contrary, in the case of a taxpayer engaged in  the  business  of
      publishing   newspapers   or   periodicals,  or  broadcasting  radio  or
      television programs, whether through the public airwaves  or  by  cable,
      direct  or  indirect  satellite  transmission,  or  any  other  means of
      transmission, there shall be allocated to  the  city,  for  purposes  of
      subparagraph  two  of  this  paragraph,  the  gross  sales or charges to
      subscribers located in the city for subscriptions  to  such  newspapers,
      periodicals,  or  program  services.  For  purposes  of  this  clause, a
      subscriber shall be deemed located in  the  city  if,  in  the  case  of
      newspapers  and periodicals, the mailing address for the subscription is
      within the city and, in  the  case  of  program  services,  the  billing
      address  for  the  subscription is within the city. For purposes of this
      clause, "subscriber" shall mean a  member  of  the  general  public  who
      receives  such  newspapers, periodicals or program services and does not
      further distribute them.
        * (10)  Notwithstanding  subparagraphs  one  through  five   of   this
      paragraph,  but  subject  to  subparagraph  eight of this paragraph, the
      business allocation percentage, to the extent that  it  is  computed  by

        * NB There are 2 รน(10)'s
        * (10)  (A) In the case of a taxpayer which is a registered securities
      or commodities broker or dealer, the receipts  specified  in  items  (i)
      through  (vii)  of  this  clause  shall be deemed to arise from services
      performed within the city to the extent set forth in each of such items.
        (i) Receipts  constituting  brokerage  commissions  derived  from  the
      execution  of securities or commodities purchase or sales orders for the
      accounts of customers shall be deemed to arise from  services  performed
      at  the  mailing  address in the records of the taxpayer of the customer
      who is responsible for paying such commissions.
        (ii)  Receipts  constituting  margin  interest  earned  on  behalf  of
      brokerage  accounts  shall be deemed to arise from services performed at
      the mailing address in the records of the taxpayer of the  customer  who
      is responsible for paying such margin interest.
        (iii)  Gross income, including any accrued interest or dividends, from
      principal transactions for  the  purchase  or  sale  of  stocks,  bonds,
      foreign  exchange and other securities or commodities (including futures
      and  forward  contracts,  options  and  other  types  of  securities  or
      commodities  derivatives  contracts)  shall  be  deemed  to  arise  from
      services performed within  the  city  either  (I)  to  the  extent  that
      production  credits are awarded to branches, offices or employees of the
      taxpayer within the city as a result of such principal  transactions  or
      (II)  if  the  taxpayer so elects, to the extent that the gross proceeds
      from such principal transactions (determined without deduction  for  any
      cost  incurred by the taxpayer to acquire the securities or commodities)
      are generated from sales  of  securities  or  commodities  to  customers
      within  the  city  based upon the mailing addresses of such customers in
      the records of the  taxpayer.  For  purposes  of  subitem  (II)  of  the
      preceding  sentence,  the taxpayer shall separately calculate such gross
      income from principal transactions by type of security or commodity. For
      purposes of this item, gross income from principal transactions shall be
      determined after the deduction of any cost incurred by the  taxpayer  to
      acquire   the   securities   or   commodities.   For  purposes  of  this
      subparagraph,  the  term  "production  credits"  means  credits  granted
      pursuant  to  the  internal  accounting  system  used by the taxpayer to
      measure the amount of revenue that should be  awarded  to  a  particular
      branch or office or employee of the taxpayer which is based, at least in
      part,  on  the  branch's,  the  office's  or  the  employee's particular
      activities. Upon request, the taxpayer shall be required  to  furnish  a
      detailed   explanation   of  such  internal  accounting  system  to  the
      department.
    
        (iv) (I)  Receipts  constituting  fees  earned  by  the  taxpayer  for
      advisory  services  to a customer in connection with the underwriting of
      securities for such customer (such customer being the  entity  which  is
      contemplating  issuing  or  is issuing securities) or fees earned by the
      taxpayer  for  managing  an  underwriting  shall be deemed to arise from
      services performed at the mailing address in the records of the taxpayer
      of such customer who is responsible for paying such fees.
        (II) Receipts constituting the primary spread  or  selling  concession
      from  underwritten  securities  shall  be  deemed to arise from services
      performed within the city to the  extent  that  production  credits  are
      awarded  to  branches,  offices  or employees of the taxpayer within the
      city as a result of the sale of the underwritten securities.
        (III) The term "primary spread" means the difference between the price
      paid by the taxpayer to the issuer of the securities being marketed  and
      the  price  received  from  the  subsequent  sale  of  the  underwritten
      securities at the  initial  public  offering  price,  less  any  selling
      concession  and  any  fees paid to the taxpayer for advisory services or
      any manager's fees, if such fees are not paid by  the  customer  to  the
      taxpayer  separately.  The  term "public offering price" means the price
      agreed upon by the taxpayer and the issuer at which the  securities  are
      to  be  offered  to  the public. The term "selling concession" means the
      amount paid to the taxpayer for participating in the underwriting  of  a
      security where the taxpayer is not the lead underwriter.
        (v) Receipts constituting interest earned by the taxpayer on loans and
      advances  made  by  the  taxpayer  to  a corporation affiliated with the
      taxpayer but with which the taxpayer is not  permitted  or  required  to
      file a combined report pursuant to subdivision four of section 11-605 of
      this  subchapter shall be deemed to arise from services performed at the
      principal place of business of such affiliated corporation.
        (vi) Receipts constituting account maintenance fees shall be deemed to
      arise from services performed at the mailing address in the  records  of
      the  taxpayer of the customer who is responsible for paying such account
      maintenance fees.
        (vii) Receipts constituting fees for management or advisory  services,
      including   fees   for  advisory  services  in  relation  to  merger  or
      acquisition activities but excluding fees paid for services described in
      item (ii) of clause (B) of subparagraph two of this paragraph, shall  be
      deemed  to  arise  from services performed at the mailing address in the
      records of the taxpayer of the customer who is  responsible  for  paying
      such fees.
        (B)  For  purposes  of  this subparagraph, the term "securities" shall
      have the same meaning as in section 475(c)(2) of  the  internal  revenue
      code  and  the  term  "commodities"  shall  have  the same meaning as in
      section 475(e)(2) of the internal revenue  code.  The  term  "registered
      securities  or  commodities  broker  or dealer" means a broker or dealer
      registered as such by the securities  and  exchange  commission  or  the
      commodities   futures   trading   commission,   and   shall  include  an
      over-the-counter derivatives dealer as defined under regulations of  the
      securities  and exchange commission at title 17, part 240, section 3b-12
      of the code of federal regulations (17 CFR 240.3b-12).
        (C) If the taxpayer receives any of the receipts enumerated in  clause
      (A)  of  this  subparagraph  as  a  result of a securities correspondent
      relationship such taxpayer has with  another  registered  securities  or
      commodities   broker   or  dealer  with  the  taxpayer  acting  in  this
      relationship as the clearing firm, such  receipts  shall  be  deemed  to
      arise from services performed within the city to the extent set forth in
      each of the items of clause (A) of this subparagraph. The amount of such
      receipts shall exclude the amount the taxpayer is required to pay to the
    
      correspondent  firm for such correspondent relationship. If the taxpayer
      receives  any  of  the  receipts  enumerated  in  clause  (A)  of   this
      subparagraph as a result of a securities correspondent relationship such
      taxpayer has with another registered securities or commodities broker or
      dealer  with the taxpayer acting in this relationship as the introducing
      firm, such receipts shall be deemed to  arise  from  services  performed
      within  the  city to the extent set forth in each of the items of clause
      (A) of this subparagraph.
        (D) If, for purposes of item (i) or (ii), subitem (I) of item (iv), or
      item (vi), or (vii) of clause (A) of this subparagraph, the taxpayer  is
      unable  from  its  records  to  determine  the  mailing  address  of the
      customer, the receipts enumerated in any of such items shall  be  deemed
      to arise from services performed at the branch or office of the taxpayer
      that  generates  the  transaction  for  the customer that generated such
      receipts.

        (b)  multiply  its  investment  income  by  an  investment  allocation
      percentage to be determined by:
        (1)  multiplying the amount of its investment capital invested in each
      stock, bond or  other  security  (other  than  governmental  securities)
      during  the  period  covered  by  its  report by the issuer's allocation
      percentage of the issuer or obligor thereof.
        (i) In the case of an issuer or obligor  subject  to  tax  under  this
      subchapter  or  subchapter  four of this chapter, or subject to tax as a
      utility corporation under chapter eleven of  this  title,  the  issuer's
      allocation percentage shall be the percentage of the appropriate measure
      (as  defined  hereinafter)  which is required to be allocated within the
      city on the report or reports, if any, required of the issuer or obligor
      under this  title  for  the  preceding  year.  The  appropriate  measure
      referred to in the preceding sentence shall be: in the case of an issuer
      or obligor subject to this subchapter, entire capital; in the case of an
      issuer  or  obligor  subject  to subchapter four of this chapter, issued
      capital stock; in the case of an issuer or obligor  subject  to  chapter
      eleven of this title as a utility corporation, gross income.
        (ii)  In  the  case  of an issuer or obligor subject to tax under part
      four of subchapter  three  of  this  chapter,  the  issuer's  allocation
      percentage shall be determined as follows:
        (A)  In  the case of a banking corporation described in paragraphs one
      through eight of subdivision (a) of section 11-640 of this chapter which
      is organized under the laws of the United  States,  this  state  or  any
      other  state  of  the  United States, the issuer's allocation percentage
      shall be its alternative entire net  income  allocation  percentage,  as
      defined  in  subdivision  (c) of section 11-642 of this chapter, for the
      preceding year.  In  the  case  of  such  a  banking  corporation  whose
      alternative  entire  net  income  for  the  preceding  year  is  derived
      exclusively from business carried  on  within  the  city,  its  issuer's
      allocation percentage shall be one hundred percent.
        (B) In the case of a banking corporation described in paragraph two of
      subdivision  (a)  of  section  11-640 of this chapter which is organized
      under the laws of a country other than the United States,  the  issuer's
      allocation  percentage  shall  be  determined by dividing (I) the amount
      described in  clause  (i)  of  subparagraph  (A)  of  paragraph  two  of
      subdivision  (a)  of section 11-642 of this chapter with respect to such
      issuer or obligor for the preceding year, by (II) the  gross  income  of
      such  issuer  or  obligor from all sources within and without the United
      States, for such preceding year, whether or not included in  alternative
      entire net income for such year.
    
        (C) In the case of an issuer or obligor described in paragraph nine of
      subdivision (a) or in paragraph two of subdivision (d) of section 11-640
      of  this chapter, the issuer's allocation percentage shall be determined
      by dividing the portion of the entire capital of the issuer  or  obligor
      allocable  to  the  city  for  the preceding year by the entire capital,
      wherever located, of the issuer or obligor for the preceding year.
        (iii) Provided, however, that if a report or reports for the preceding
      year are not filed, or if filed do not contain information  which  would
      permit  the  determination  of such issuer's allocation percentage, then
      the issuer's allocation percentage to be used shall, at  the  discretion
      of  the  commissioner  of finance, be either (A) the issuer's allocation
      percentage derived from the most recently filed report or reports of the
      issuer or obligor or (B) a percentage calculated, by the commissioner of
      finance, reasonably to indicate the degree of economic presence  in  the
      city of the issuer or obligor during the preceding year.
        (2) adding together the sum so obtained, and
        (3)  dividing  the  result  so obtained by the total of its investment
      capital  invested  during  such  period  in  stocks,  bonds  and   other
      securities;  provided,  however,  that in case any investment capital is
      invested in any stock, bond or other security during only a  portion  of
      the  period  covered  by  the  report, only such portion of such capital
      shall be taken into account; and provided further, that if a  taxpayer's
      investment  allocation  percentage  is  zero,  interest received on bank
      accounts shall be multiplied by its business allocation percentage; and
        (c) add the products so obtained.
        (d) Except as provided in subparagraph three of this paragraph  or  in
      paragraph (e) of this subdivision, at the election of the taxpayer there
      shall  be  deducted  from the portion of its entire net income allocated
      within the city either or both of the items set forth  in  subparagraphs
      one  and  two of this paragraph, except that only one of such deductions
      shall be allowed with respect to any one item of property.
        (1) Depreciation with respect to any property  such  as  described  in
      subparagraph   three   of   this  paragraph,  not  exceeding  twice  the
      depreciation allowed with respect  to  the  same  property  for  federal
      income tax purposes. Such deduction shall be allowed only upon condition
      that  entire  net  income  be  computed  without  any  deduction for the
      depreciation of the same property,  and  the  total  of  all  deductions
      allowed in any taxable year or years with respect to the depreciation of
      any such property shall not exceed its cost or other basis.
        (2)  Expenditures  paid  or  incurred  during the taxable year for the
      construction, reconstruction, erection or acquisition  of  any  property
      such  as described in subparagraph three of this paragraph which is used
      or  to  be  used  for  purposes  of  research  and  development  in  the
      experimental  or  laboratory sense. Such purposes shall not be deemed to
      include the ordinary testing or inspection of materials or products  for
      quality   control,  efficiency  surveys,  management  studies,  consumer
      surveys,  advertising,  promotions  or  research  in   connection   with
      literary,  historical  or  similar  projects.  Such  deduction  shall be
      allowed only on condition that entire net income for  the  taxable  year
      and  all  succeeding  taxable years be computed without the deduction of
      any such expenditures and without any deduction for depreciation of  the
      same  property,  except to the extent that its basis may be attributable
      to factors other than such expenditures,  or  in  case  a  deduction  is
      allowable  pursuant  to  this  subparagraph  for  only  a  part  of such
      expenditures, on condition that any deduction allowed for federal income
      tax  purposes  on  account  of  such  expenditures  or  on  account   of
      depreciation   of  the  same  property  be  proportionately  reduced  in
      computing entire net income for the  taxable  year  and  all  succeeding
    
      taxable  years. With respect to property which is used or to be used for
      research and development only in part, or during only part of its useful
      life, a proportionate part of such expenditures shall be deductible.  If
      all or part of such expenditures with respect to any property shall have
      been deducted as provided herein, and such property is used for purposes
      other  than research and development to a greater extent than originally
      reported, the taxpayer shall report such use in its report for the first
      taxable year during which it occurs, and the commissioner of finance may
      recompute the tax for the year or years for  which  such  deduction  was
      allowed,   and  may  assess  any  additional  tax  resulting  from  such
      recomputation regardless of the time limitations set  forth  in  section
      11-674 of this chapter.
        (3)  Such  deductions  shall  be allowed only with respect to tangible
      property  which  is  depreciable  pursuant  to   section   one   hundred
      sixty-seven of the internal revenue code, having a situs in the city and
      used in the taxpayer's trade or business, (A) constructed, reconstructed
      or  erected  after  December  thirty-first, nineteen hundred sixty-five,
      pursuant to a contract which was, on or  before  December  thirty-first,
      nineteen  hundred  sixty-seven,  and at all times thereafter, binding on
      the taxpayer or, property, the physical construction, reconstruction  or
      erection  of  which  began  on or before December thirty-first, nineteen
      hundred sixty-seven or which began after such date pursuant to an  order
      placed on or before December thirty-first, nineteen hundred sixty-seven,
      and  then  only with respect to that portion of the basis thereof or the
      expenditures relating thereto which is  properly  attributable  to  such
      construction,  reconstruction  or  erection after December thirty-first,
      nineteen  hundred   sixty-five,   or   (B)   acquired   after   December
      thirty-first,  nineteen hundred sixty-five, pursuant to a contract which
      was, on or before December thirty-first, nineteen  hundred  sixty-seven,
      and  at  all times thereafter, binding on the taxpayer or pursuant to an
      order placed  on  or  before  December  thirty-first,  nineteen  hundred
      sixty-seven,  by purchase as defined in section one hundred seventy-nine
      (d) of the internal revenue code, if the original use of  such  property
      commenced  with  the taxpayer, commenced in the city and commenced after
      December thirty-first, nineteen hundred  sixty-five,  or  (C)  acquired,
      constructed,   reconstructed,   or   erected   subsequent   to  December
      thirty-first  nineteen  hundred  sixty-seven,   if   such   acquisition,
      construction,  reconstruction  or  erection is pursuant to a plan of the
      taxpayer which was in existence December thirty-first, nineteen  hundred
      sixty-seven   and   not  thereafter  substantially  modified,  and  such
      acquisition, construction,  reconstruction  or  erection  would  qualify
      under  the  rules  in  paragraphs four, five or six of subsection (h) of
      section forty-eight of the internal revenue code provided all references
      in such paragraphs four,  five  and  six  to  the  dates  October  nine,
      nineteen hundred sixty-six, and October ten, nineteen hundred sixty-six,
      shall  be read as December thirty-first, nineteen hundred sixty-seven. A
      taxpayer shall be allowed a deduction under clauses (A), (B) or  (C)  of
      this  subparagraph  only  if the tangible property shall be delivered or
      the construction, reconstruction or erection shall be  completed  on  or
      before December thirty-first, nineteen hundred sixty-nine, except in the
      case  of tangible property which is acquired, constructed, reconstructed
      or erected pursuant to a contract  which  was,  on  or  before  December
      thirty-first, nineteen hundred sixty-seven, and at all times thereafter,
      binding  on  the  taxpayer.  Provided,  however,  for  any  taxable year
      beginning on or after January first,  nineteen  hundred  sixty-eight,  a
      taxpayer  shall  not  be  allowed a deduction under paragraph (d) hereof
      with respect to tangible personal property leased by  it  to  any  other
      person  or  corporation.  For  purposes  of  the preceding sentence, any
    
      contract or agreement to lease or rent or for  a  license  to  use  such
      property shall be considered a lease. With respect to property which the
      taxpayer  uses  itself  for  purposes  other  than leasing for part of a
      taxable year and leases for a part of a taxable year, the taxpayer shall
      be  allowed a deduction under paragraph (d) in proportion to the part of
      the year it uses such property.
        (4) If the deductions allowable for any taxable year, pursuant to this
      subdivision, exceed the portion of  the  taxpayer's  entire  net  income
      allocated  to  the city for such year, the excess may be carried over to
      the following taxable year or years and may be deducted from the portion
      of the taxpayer's entire net income allocated to the city for such  year
      or years.
        (5)  In  any  taxable year when property is sold or otherwise disposed
      of, with respect to which a  deduction  has  been  allowed  pursuant  to
      subparagraph  one  or  two  of  this paragraph, the gain or loss thereon
      entering into  the  computation  of  federal  taxable  income  shall  be
      disregarded  in computing entire net income, and there shall be added to
      or subtracted from the portion of entire net income allocated within the
      city the gain or loss upon such sale or other disposition. In  computing
      such gain or loss the basis of the property sold or disposed of shall be
      adjusted  to reflect the deduction allowed with respect to such property
      pursuant to  subparagraph  one  or  two  of  this  paragraph.  Provided,
      however,  that  no  loss  shall  be  recognized for the purposes of this
      subparagraph with respect to a sale or other disposition of property  to
      a  person  whose  acquisition  thereof  is  not a purchase as defined in
      section one hundred seventy-nine (d) of the internal revenue code.
        (e) At the election of the taxpayer there shall be deducted  from  the
      portion  of  its  entire  net income allocated within the city either or
      both of the items set  forth  in  subparagraphs  one  and  two  of  this
      paragraph, except that only one of such deductions shall be allowed with
      respect to any one item of property.
        (1)  Depreciation  with  respect  to any property such as described in
      subparagraphs three and four of this paragraph, not exceeding twice  the
      depreciation  allowed  with  respect  to  the  same property for federal
      income tax purposes. Such deduction shall be allowed only upon condition
      that entire net  income  be  computed  without  any  deduction  for  the
      depreciation  of  the  same  property,  and  the total of all deductions
      allowed in any taxable year or years with respect to the depreciation of
      any such property shall not exceed its cost or other basis multiplied by
      the taxpayer's business  allocation  percentage  determined  under  this
      subdivision  for  the first year it deducts such depreciation under this
      paragraph.
        (2) Expenditures paid or incurred during  the  taxable  year  for  the
      construction,  reconstruction,  erection  or acquisition of any property
      such as described in subparagraph three of this paragraph which is  used
      or  to  be  used  for  purposes  of  research  and  development  in  the
      experimental or laboratory sense. Such purposes shall not be  deemed  to
      include  the ordinary testing or inspection of materials or products for
      quality  control,  efficiency  surveys,  management  studies,   consumer
      surveys,   advertising,   promotions  or  research  in  connection  with
      literary, historical or  similar  projects.  Such  deductions  shall  be
      allowed  only  on  condition  that  it does not exceed the amount of the
      expenditures multiplied by the taxpayer's business allocation percentage
      determined under this subdivision for the year the expenditures are paid
      or incurred and that entire net income for  the  taxable  year  and  all
      succeeding  taxable  years be computed without the deduction of any such
      expenditures and without any deduction  for  depreciation  of  the  same
      property,  except  to  the  extent that its basis may be attributable to
    
      factors other  than  such  expenditures,  or  in  case  a  deduction  is
      allowable  pursuant  to  this  subparagraph  for  only  a  part  of such
      expenditures, on condition that any deduction allowed for federal income
      tax   purposes  on  account  of  such  expenditures  or  on  account  of
      depreciation  of  the  same  property  be  proportionately  reduced   in
      computing  entire  net  income  for  the taxable year and all succeeding
      taxable years. With respect to property which is used or to be used  for
      research and development only in part, or during only part of its useful
      life,  a proportionate part of such expenditures shall be deductible. If
      all or part of such expenditures with respect to any property shall have
      been deducted as provided herein, and such property is used for purposes
      other than research and development to a greater extent than  originally
      reported, the taxpayer shall report such use in its report for the first
      taxable year during which it occurs, and the commissioner of finance may
      recompute  the  tax  for  the year or years for which such deduction was
      allowed,  and  may  assess  any  additional  tax  resulting  from   such
      recomputation  regardless  of  the time limitations set forth in section
      11-674 of this chapter.
        (3) Such deduction shall be allowed  only  with  respect  to  tangible
      property   which   is   depreciable  pursuant  to  section  one  hundred
      sixty-seven of the internal revenue code, having a situs in the city and
      used  in  the  taxpayer's  trade  or  business  (A)  the   construction,
      reconstruction   or  erection  of  which  is  completed  after  December
      thirty-first, nineteen hundred sixty-seven, and then only  with  respect
      to  that  portion  of  the  basis  thereof  or the expenditures relating
      thereto  which  is   properly   attributable   to   such   construction,
      reconstruction or erection after December thirty-first, nineteen hundred
      sixty-five,  or  (B)  acquired  after  December  thirty-first,  nineteen
      hundred sixty-seven by  purchase  or  defined  in  section  one  hundred
      seventy-nine  (d)  of  the internal revenue code, if the original use of
      such property commenced with the taxpayer, commenced in this  state  and
      commenced  after  December  thirty-first  nineteen  hundred  sixty-five.
      Provided, however, for any taxable year beginning on  or  after  January
      first,  nineteen  hundred sixty-eight, a taxpayer shall not be allowed a
      deduction under paragraph (e) hereof with respect to  tangible  personal
      property  leased  by it to any other person or corporation. For purposes
      of the preceding sentence, any contract or agreement to lease or rent or
      for a license to use such property shall be  considered  a  lease.  With
      respect  to  property  which the taxpayer uses itself for purposes other
      than leasing for part of a taxable year and  leases  for  a  part  of  a
      taxable  year, the taxpayer shall be allowed a deduction under paragraph
      (e) in proportion to the part of the year it uses such property.
        (4) A deduction under subparagraph one  of  this  paragraph  shall  be
      allowed  with  respect  to  tangible  property described in subparagraph
      three only if such property is principally used by the taxpayer  in  the
      production  of goods by manufacturing; processing; assembling; refining;
      mining; extracting; farming;  agriculture;  horticulture;  floriculture;
      viticulture  or  commercial  fishing. For purposes of this subparagraph,
      manufacturing shall mean the process of working raw materials into wares
      suitable for use or  which  gives  new  shapes,  new  qualities  or  new
      combinations  to  matter  which already has gone through some artificial
      process by the use of machinery, tools,  appliances  and  other  similar
      equipment.  Property  used  in  the  production  of  goods shall include
      machinery, equipment or other tangible  property  which  is  principally
      used  in  the  repair and service of other machinery, equipment or other
      tangible property used principally in the production of goods and  shall
      include  all  facilities  used in the manufacturing operation, including
      storage of material to be used in manufacturing and of the products that
    
      are manufactured. At the option of the taxpayer, air and water pollution
      control facilities which qualify for elective deductions under paragraph
      (g) of subdivision eight of section 11-602 of  this  subchapter  may  be
      treated,   for   purposes   of  this  paragraph,  as  tangible  property
      principally  used  in  the  production  of   goods   by   manufacturing;
      processing;   assembling;   refining;   mining;   extracting;   farming;
      agriculture;  horticulture;  floriculture;  viticulture;  or  commercial
      fishing,  in  which  event,  a deduction shall not be allowed under such
      paragraph (g).
        (5) Subject to the limitation imposed by  subparagraphs  one  and  two
      hereof,  if  the  deductions allowable for any taxable year, pursuant to
      this subdivision, exceed the portion of the taxpayer's entire net income
      allocated to the city for such year, the excess may be carried  over  to
      the following taxable year or years and may be deducted from the portion
      of  the taxpayer's entire net income allocated to the city for such year
      or years.
        (6) In any taxable year when property is sold  or  otherwise  disposed
      of,  with  respect  to  which  a  deduction has been allowed pursuant to
      subparagraph one or two of this paragraph,  the  gain  or  loss  thereon
      entering  into  the  computation  of  federal  taxable  income  shall be
      disregarded in computing entire net income, and there shall be added  to
      or subtracted from the portion of entire net income allocated within the
      city  the gain or loss upon such sale or other disposition. In computing
      such gain or loss the basis of the property sold or disposed of shall be
      adjusted to reflect the deduction allowed with respect to such  property
      pursuant  to  subparagraph  one  or  two  of  this  paragraph. Provided,
      however, that no loss shall be  recognized  for  the  purposes  of  this
      subparagraph  with respect to a sale or other disposition of property to
      a person whose acquisition thereof is  not  a  purchase  as  defined  in
      section one hundred seventy-nine (d) of the internal revenue code.
        4.  The  portion of the business capital of a taxpayer to be allocated
      within the city shall be determined by multiplying the amount thereof by
      the business allocation percentage determined as  hereinabove  provided.
      Provided,  however, such business allocation percentage, for purposes of
      allocating business capital,  shall  (a)  for  taxable  years  beginning
      before  nineteen  hundred  ninety-four,  be determined without regard to
      clause (C) of subparagraph six of paragraph (a) of subdivision three  of
      this  section and (b) for taxable years beginning after nineteen hundred
      ninety-three, be determined with regard to such clause (C) but  only  in
      the  case  of  a  taxpayer subject to the provisions of paragraph (b) of
      subdivision six of section 11-602 of this subchapter.
        5. The portion of the investment capital of a taxpayer to be allocated
      within the city shall be determined by multiplying the amount thereof by
      the investment allocation percentage determined as hereinabove provided.
        7. The portion of the subsidiary capital of a taxpayer to be allocated
      within the city shall be determined by (a) multiplying the amount of its
      subsidiary capital invested in each subsidiary during the period covered
      by its report (or, in the case of any such capital  so  invested  during
      only  a  portion  of  such  period, such portion of such capital) by the
      issuer's allocation  percentage,  as  defined  in  subparagraph  one  of
      paragraph  (b)  of  subdivision  three  of  this  section,  of each such
      subsidiary and (b) adding together the sums so obtained.
        8. If it shall appear to the commissioner of finance that any business
      or investment allocation percentage determined as  hereinabove  provided
      does not properly reflect the activity, business, income or capital of a
      taxpayer   within  the  city,  the  commissioner  of  finance  shall  be
      authorized in  his  or  her  discretion,  in  the  case  of  a  business
      allocation  percentage, to adjust it by (a) excluding one or more of the
    
      factors therein, (b) including  one  or  more  other  factors,  such  as
      expenses,  purchases,  contract  values  (minus subcontract values), (c)
      excluding one or more assets in computing  such  allocation  percentage,
      provided the income therefrom is also excluded in determining entire net
      income,  or  (d)  any  other  similar  or different method calculated to
      effect a fair and proper allocation of the income and capital reasonably
      attributable to the city, and in the case of  an  investment  allocation
      percentage  to  adjust  it  by excluding one or more assets in computing
      such percentage provided  the  income  therefrom  is  also  excluded  in

      allocation  percentage  determined  as  hereinabove  provided  does  not
      properly reflect the activity, business, income or capital of a taxpayer
      within the city, the commissioner of finance shall be authorized in  his
      or  her  discretion  to  adjust  it  by (a) excluding one or more of the
      factors therein, (b) including  one  or  more  other  factors,  such  as
      expenses,  purchases,  contract  values  (minus subcontract values), (c)
      excluding one or more assets in computing  such  allocation  percentage,
      provided  the  income  therefrom, is also excluded in determining entire
      net income, or (d) any other similar or different method  calculated  to
      effect a fair and proper allocation of the income and capital reasonably
      attributable  to  the  city, and in the case of an investment allocation
      percentage, to adjust it by excluding one or more  assets  in  computing
      such  percentage  provided  the  income  therefrom  is  also excluded in
      determining entire net income. The commissioner of finance from time  to
      time  shall  publish all rulings of general public interest with respect
      to any application of the provisions of this subdivision.
        11. (a) A taxpayer shall be allowed a credit, to be  refunded  in  the

      law, provided such shares or certificates are sold:
        (i) as stock in trade or inventory or as property held for sale in the
      ordinary course of such dealer's trade or business (including  transfers
      which are part of an underwriting),
        (ii)  in  (a) a bona fide arbitrage transaction; (b) a bona fide hedge
      transaction involving a long or short position in  any  equity  security

      transaction  in  connection  with  a  merger, acquisition, tender offer,
      recapitalization, reorganization, or similar transaction, or
        (iii) to offset a transaction made in error.
    
        Provided, however, that, except as to subclause (c) of clause (ii)  of

      hundred thirty-six of the internal revenue code.
        (c)  The  credit  allowed  under this subdivision for any taxable year
      shall be deemed to be an overpayment  of  tax  by  the  taxpayer  to  be
      credited or refunded in accordance with the provisions of section 11-677
      of  this  chapter,  except as otherwise provided in subdivision three of
      section 11-606 and  subdivision  eleven  of  section  11-608;  provided,

      to be refunded pursuant to this subdivision shall not be paid  prior  to
      the  first  day  of  the eighth month following the close of the taxable
      year, and the provisions of subdivision three of section 11-679 of  this

      imposed by subchapter two of  chapter  eleven  of  this  title  for  any
      periods  embraced  within  the  taxable  year of the taxpayer under this
      subchapter.
        (b) The credit allowed under this subdivision  for  any  taxable  year
      shall  be  deemed  to  be  an  overpayment  of tax by the taxpayer to be
      credited  or  refunded,  without  interest,  in  accordance   with   the
      provisions of section 11-677 of this chapter.
    
        (c)  Where the taxpayer receives a refund or credit of any tax imposed
      under section eleven hundred seven of the tax law for which the taxpayer
      had claimed a credit under the provisions of this subdivision in a prior
      taxable year, the amount of such tax refund shall be added  to  the  tax
      imposed  by  subdivision  one  of section 11-603 of this subchapter, and
      such amount shall be subtracted in computing entire net income  for  the
      taxable year.
        13.  (a)  In  addition  to any other credit allowed by this section, a
      taxpayer shall be allowed a credit  against  the  tax  imposed  by  this
      subchapter  to  be  credited or refunded without interest, in the manner
      hereinafter provided in this section.
        (1) Where a taxpayer shall have relocated to the city from a  location
      outside  the  state, and by such relocation shall have created a minimum
      of one hundred industrial or commercial  employment  opportunities;  and
      where  such  taxpayer  shall  have  entered into a written lease for the
      relocation premises, the terms of  which  lease  provide  for  increased
      additional  payments to the landlord which are based solely and directly
      upon any increase or addition in real estate taxes imposed on the leased
      premises, the taxpayer upon approval and certification by the industrial
      and commercial incentive board as hereinafter provided shall be entitled
      to a credit against the tax imposed by this subchapter.  The  amount  of
      such  credit  shall be: An amount equal to the annual increased payments
      actually made by the taxpayer to  the  landlord  which  are  solely  and
      directly  attributable to an increase or addition to the real estate tax
      imposed upon the leased premises. Such credit shall be allowed  only  to
      the  extent that the taxpayer has not otherwise claimed said amount as a
      deduction against the tax imposed by this subchapter.
        The  industrial  and  commercial  incentive  board  in  approving  and
      certifying  to  the  qualifications  of  the taxpayer to receive the tax
      credit provided for herein shall first determine that the applicant  has
      met  the requirements of this section, and further, that the granting of
      the tax credit  to  the  applicant  is  in  the  "public  interest".  In
      determining  that  the  granting  of  the  tax  credit  is in the public
      interest, the board shall make affirmative findings that:  the  granting
      of  the tax credit to the applicant will not effect an undue hardship on
      similar taxpayers already located within the city; the existence of this
      tax incentive has been instrumental in bringing about the relocation  of
      the  applicant  to  the  city;  and  the granting of the tax credit will
      foster the economic recovery and economic development of the city.
        The tax credit, if  approved  and  certified  by  the  industrial  and
      commercial  incentive  board,  must be utilized annually by the taxpayer
      for the length of the term of the lease or for a period  not  to  exceed
      ten years from the date of relocation whichever period is shorter.

      against   employment   opportunity  relocation  costs  incurred  by  the
      taxpayer. Such credit shall be allowed  only  to  the  extent  that  the
      taxpayer   has   not   claimed  a  deduction  for  allowable  employment

      taxpayer  that has obtained the certifications required by chapter six-B

      subdivision (j) of such section is before July first,  nineteen  hundred
      ninety-five,  the  amount  to  be  multiplied  by the number of eligible
      aggregate employment shares shall be five hundred dollars,  and  if  the

      pursuant to subdivision (d) of section 22-622 of the code to  take  such
      credit  against  a  gross receipts tax imposed by chapter eleven of this
      title; and provided that in the case of an eligible  business  that  has
      obtained   pursuant   to   chapter   six-B   of  such  title  twenty-two
      certifications of eligibility for more than one relocation, the  portion
      of  the  total  amount  of  eligible  aggregate  employment shares to be
      multiplied by the dollar amount specified in this subdivision  for  each
      such  certification  of  a  relocation  shall  be  the  number  of total
      attributed eligible aggregate employment shares determined with  respect
      to  such relocation pursuant to subdivision (o) of section 22-621 of the
      code. For purposes of this subdivision, the  terms  "eligible  aggregate
      employment  shares,"  "relocate," "retail activity" and "hotel services"

      first taxable year  during  which  such  eligible  aggregate  employment
    
      shares  are  maintained with respect to such premises and for any of the
      twelve  succeeding  taxable  years  during  which   eligible   aggregate
      employment shares are maintained with respect to such premises; provided
      that the credit allowed for the twelfth succeeding taxable year shall be
      calculated  by  multiplying  the number of eligible aggregate employment
      shares  maintained  with  respect  to  such  premises  in  the   twelfth
      succeeding  taxable  year  by  the  lesser  of  one  and  a fraction the
      numerator of which is such  number  of  days  in  the  taxable  year  of
      relocation  less  the  number  of  days the eligible business maintained
      employment shares in the  eligible  premises  in  the  taxable  year  of
      relocation  and  the  denominator of which is the number of days in such
      twelfth succeeding taxable year during  which  such  eligible  aggregate
      employment  shares  are maintained with respect to such premises. Except
      as provided in paragraph (d) of this subdivision, if the amount  of  the
      credit allowable under this subdivision for any taxable year exceeds the
      tax  imposed for such year, the excess may be carried over, in order, to
      the five immediately succeeding taxable years and,  to  the  extent  not
      previously  deductible, may be deducted from the taxpayer's tax for such
      years.
        (c) The credit allowable under  this  subdivision  shall  be  deducted
      after  the  credit  allowed by subdivision eighteen of this section, but
      prior to the deduction of any other credit allowed by this section.
        (d) In the case of a taxpayer that has  obtained  a  certification  of
      eligibility  pursuant  to  chapter six-B of title twenty-two of the code
      dated on or after July first, two thousand for a relocation to  eligible
      premises  located  within the revitalization area defined in subdivision
      (n) of section 22-621 of  the  code,  the  credits  allowed  under  this
      subdivision,  or  in the case of a taxpayer that has relocated more than
      once, the portion of such credits attributed to  such  certification  of
      eligibility  pursuant  to paragraph (a) of this subdivision, against the
      tax imposed by this chapter for the taxable year of such relocation  and
      for  the  four  taxable years immediately succeeding the taxable year of
      such relocation, shall be deemed  to  be  overpayments  of  tax  by  the
      taxpayer  to  be  credited  or refunded, without interest, in accordance
      with the provisions of section 11-677 of this chapter. For such  taxable
      years,  such  credits or portions thereof may not be carried over to any
      succeeding taxable year; provided, however, that  this  paragraph  shall
      not apply to any relocation for which an application for a certification
      of  eligibility  was  not  submitted  prior  to July first, two thousand
      three, unless the date of such relocation is on or after July first, two
      thousand.

      taxpayer  shall  be  allowed  a  credit  against the tax imposed by this
      subchapter to be credited or refunded in the manner hereinafter provided
      in this subdivision. The amount of such credit shall  be  equal  to  the
      amount  of  sales  and  compensating use taxes imposed by section eleven
      hundred seven of the tax law during the taxpayer's taxable year (and the
      amount of any interest imposed in connection therewith) which  was  paid
      after  January  first,  nineteen hundred ninety-five, less any credit or
      refund of such taxes (or such interest), with respect to the purchase or
      use by the taxpayer of the services  described  in  subdivision  (b)  of
      section eleven hundred five-b of the tax law.
        (b)  The  credit  allowed  under this subdivision for any taxable year
      shall be deemed to be an overpayment  of  tax  by  the  taxpayer  to  be
      credited   or   refunded,  without  interest,  in  accordance  with  the
      provisions of section 11-677 of this chapter.
        (c) Where the taxpayer receives a refund or credit of any tax  imposed
      under  section  eleven  hundred seven of the tax law (or of any interest
    
      imposed in connection therewith) for which the taxpayer  had  claimed  a
      credit under the provisions of this subdivision in a prior taxable year,
      the  amount  of  such  tax  (or such interest) refund or credit shall be
      added  to  the  tax imposed by subdivision one of section 11-603 of this
      subchapter, and such amount shall be subtracted in computing entire  net
      income for the taxable year.
        17-b.  (a)  For taxable years beginning on or after January first, two
      thousand six, in addition to any other credit allowed by  this  section,
      an  eligible  business  that  first enters into a binding contract on or
      after July first, two  thousand  five  to  purchase  or  lease  eligible
      premises  to  which  it  relocates  shall  be  allowed a one-time credit
      against the tax imposed by this subchapter to be credited or refunded in
      the manner hereinafter provided in this subdivision. The amount of  such
      credit  shall  be one thousand dollars per full-time employee; provided,
      however, that the amount of such credit shall not exceed the  lesser  of
      actual relocation costs or one hundred thousand dollars.
        (b)  When used in this subdivision, the following terms shall have the
      following meanings:
        "Eligible business" means any  business  subject  to  tax  under  this
      subchapter  that (1) has been conducting substantial business operations

      and engages primarily in industrial and  manufacturing  activities.  For
      purposes  of  this  subdivision, the date of relocation shall be (1) the
      date of the completion of the relocation to the eligible premises or (2)
      ninety days from the commencement of  the  relocation  to  the  eligible
      premises, whichever is earlier.
    
        "Relocation  costs"  means  costs  incurred  in the relocation of such

      purchased in connection with the relocation.
        (c) The credit allowed under this subdivision  for  any  taxable  year

      credited or refunded without interest, in accordance with the provisions
      of section 11-677 of this chapter.
        (d) The number of full-time employees for the purposes of  calculating
      an  industrial  business  tax  credit  shall  be  the  average number of
      full-time employees, calculated on  a  weekly  basis,  employed  in  the

        (f) For the purposes of calculating entire net income in  the  taxable
      year  that an industrial business tax credit is allowed, a taxpayer must

        18. (a) If a corporation is a partner in  an  unincorporated  business
      taxable  under chapter five of this title, and is required to include in
      entire net income its distributive  share  of  income,  gain,  loss  and
      deductions   of,   or  guaranteed  payments  from,  such  unincorporated
      business, such corporation shall be allowed a  credit  against  the  tax
      imposed by this subchapter equal to the lesser of the amounts determined
      in subparagraphs one and two of this paragraph:
        (1)  The  amount determined in this subparagraph is the product of (A)
      the sum of (i) the tax imposed by chapter five  of  this  title  on  the
      unincorporated  business  for its taxable year ending within or with the
      taxable year of the corporation and paid by the unincorporated  business
      and (ii) the amount of any credit or credits taken by the unincorporated
      business  under  section 11-503 of this title (except the credit allowed
      by subdivision (b) of such section) for its taxable year  ending  within
      or  with  the  taxable  year of the corporation, to the extent that such
      credits do not reduce such unincorporated business's tax below zero, and
      (B) a fraction,  the  numerator  of  which  is  the  net  total  of  the
      corporation's  distributive  share  of income, gain, loss and deductions
      of, and guaranteed payments from, the unincorporated business  for  such
      taxable  year, and the denominator of which is the sum, for such taxable
    
      year, of the net total distributive shares of  income,  gain,  loss  and
      deductions   of,  and  guaranteed  payments  to,  all  partners  in  the
      unincorporated business for whom or which such net total (as  separately
      determined for each partner) is greater than zero.
        (2)  The  amount determined in this subparagraph is the product of (A)
      the excess of (i) the tax computed under clause one of subparagraph  (a)
      of  paragraph E of subdivision one of this section, without allowance of
      any credits allowed by this section, over  (ii)  the  tax  so  computed,
      determined  as  if  the  corporation  had  no such distributive share or
      guaranteed payments with respect to the unincorporated business, and (B)
      a fraction, the numerator of which is four and the denominator of  which
      is  eight  and  eighty-five  one hundredths, provided, however, that the
      amounts computed in clauses (i) and (ii) of this subparagraph  shall  be
      computed with the following modifications:
        (I)  such  amounts  shall  be computed without taking into account any
      carryforward or carryback by the partner of a net operating loss;
        (II) if, prior to  taking  into  account  any  distributive  share  or
      guaranteed   payments  from  any  unincorporated  business  or  any  net
      operating loss carryforward or carryback, the entire net income  of  the
      partner  is  less  than zero, such entire net income shall be treated as
      zero; and
        (III) if such partner's net total distributive share of income,  gain,
      loss and deductions of, and guaranteed payments from, any unincorporated
      business is less than zero, such net total shall be treated as zero. The
      amount determined in this subparagraph shall not be less than zero.
        (b)(1)  Notwithstanding  anything  to the contrary in paragraph (a) of
      this subdivision,  in  the  case  of  a  corporation  that,  before  the
      application  of  this  subdivision  or  any other credit allowed by this
      section, is liable for the tax on entire net income under clause one  of
      subparagraph  (a) of paragraph E of subdivision one of this section, the
      credit or the sum of the credits that may be taken by  such  corporation
      for   a   taxable  year  under  this  subdivision  with  respect  to  an
      unincorporated business or unincorporated businesses in which  it  is  a
      partner  shall  not exceed the tax so computed, without allowance of any
      credits allowed by this section, multiplied by a fraction the  numerator
      of  which  is four and the denominator of which is eight and eighty-five
      one hundredths. If the credit allowed under this subdivision or the  sum
      of  such  credits exceeds the product of such tax and such fraction, the
      amount of the excess may be carried forward, in order, to  each  of  the
      seven  immediately  succeeding  taxable  years  and,  to  the extent not
      previously taken, shall be allowed as a credit in each of such years. In
      applying the provisions of the preceding sentence, the credit determined
      for the taxable year under paragraph (a) of this  subdivision  shall  be
      taken  before  taking any credit carryforward pursuant to this paragraph
      and the credit carryforward attributable to the  earliest  taxable  year
      shall  be  taken  before  taking a credit carryforward attributable to a
      subsequent taxable year.
        (2) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in paragraph (a) of  this
      subdivision,  in  the case of a corporation that, before the application
      of this subdivision or any other credit  allowed  by  this  section,  is
      liable  for the tax on entire net income plus certain salaries and other
      compensation under clause three of subparagraph (a) of  paragraph  E  of
      subdivision one of this section, the maximum credit that may be taken in
      any  taxable  year  is  the amount that will reduce the tax so computed,
      without allowance of any credits allowed by this section, to  zero.  For
      purposes  of this paragraph each dollar of credit shall be applied so as
      to reduce such tax for taxable years beginning before January first, two
      thousand seven by sixty-six and thirty-eight one hundredths  cents;  for
    
      taxable  years  beginning  on or after January first, two thousand seven
      and before January first, two thousand eight by  fifty-eight  and  eight
      one-hundredths  cents;  for  taxable years beginning on or after January
      first, two thousand eight and before January first, two thousand nine by
      forty-nine  and  seventy-eight  one-hundredths  cents; for taxable years
      beginning on or after  January  first,  two  thousand  nine  and  before
      January   first,   two   thousand   ten  by  forty-one  and  forty-eight
      one-hundredths cents; and  for  taxable  years  beginning  on  or  after
      January   first,   two   thousand   ten  by  thirty-three  and  nineteen
      one-hundredths cents.  If  the  amount  of  credit  allowed  under  this
      subdivision  or  the  sum of such credits exceeds the amount that may be
      taken against such tax, the amount of the excess may be carried forward,
      in order, to each of the seven immediately succeeding taxable years and,
      to the extent not previously taken, shall be allowed as a credit in each
      of such years. In applying the provisions of the preceding sentence, the
      credit determined for the taxable  year  under  paragraph  (a)  of  this
      subdivision  shall  be  taken  before  taking  any  credit  carryforward
      pursuant to this paragraph and the credit carryforward  attributable  to
      the  earliest  taxable  year  shall  be  taken  before  taking  a credit
      carryforward attributable to a subsequent taxable year.
        (3) No credit allowed under this subdivision may be taken in a taxable
      year by a taxpayer that, in the absence of such credit, would be  liable
      for  the  tax  computed  on the basis of business and investment capital
      under clause two of subparagraph (a) of paragraph E of  subdivision  one
      of  this  section  or  the fixed-dollar minimum tax under clause four of
      subparagraph (a) of paragraph E of subdivision one of this  section.  No
      credit  allowed  under  this  subdivision  may  be taken against the tax
      computed on the basis of subsidiary capital under  subparagraph  (b)  of
      paragraph E of subdivision one of this section.
        (c)  For  corporations that file a report on a combined basis pursuant
      to subdivision four of  section  11-605  of  this  chapter,  the  credit
      allowed  by  this subdivision shall be computed as if the combined group
      were the partner in each unincorporated business from which any  of  the
      members  of  such group had a distributive share or guaranteed payments,
      provided, however, if more than one member of the combined  group  is  a
      partner  in  the  same  unincorporated  business,  for  purposes  of the
      calculation required in  subparagraph  one  of  paragraph  (a)  of  this
      subdivision,  the  numerator  of the fraction described in clause (B) of
      such subparagraph one shall be the sum of  the  net  total  distributive
      shares  of income, gain, loss and deductions of, and guaranteed payments
      from, the  unincorporated  business  of  all  of  the  partners  of  the
      unincorporated  business  within  the  combined group for which such net
      total (as separately determined for each partner) is greater than  zero,
      and  the  denominator of such fraction shall be the sum of the net total
      distributive shares  of  income,  gain,  loss  and  deductions  of,  and
      guaranteed payments from, the unincorporated business of all partners in
      the  unincorporated  business  for  whom  or  which  such  net total (as
      separately determined for each partner) is greater than zero.
        (d) The credit allowed by this subdivision shall not be allowed  to  a
      partner  in  an  unincorporated business with respect to any tax paid by
      the unincorporated business under chapter five of  this  title  for  any
      taxable year beginning before July first, nineteen hundred ninety-four.
        (e) Notwithstanding any other provision of this subchapter, the credit
      allowable  under  this subdivision shall be taken prior to the taking of
      any other credit allowed by  this  section.  Notwithstanding  any  other
      provision  of this subchapter, the application of this subdivision shall
      not change the basis on which  the  taxpayer's  tax  is  computed  under
      paragraph E of subdivision one of this section.
    
        19.  Lower  Manhattan relocation and employment assistance credit. (a)
      In addition to any other credit allowed by this section, a taxpayer that
      has obtained the certifications  required  by  chapter  six-C  of  title
      twenty-two of the code shall be allowed a credit against the tax imposed
      by this chapter. The amount of the credit shall be the amount determined
      by  multiplying  three  thousand  dollars  by  the  number  of  eligible
      aggregate employment  shares  maintained  by  the  taxpayer  during  the
      taxable year with respect to eligible premises to which the taxpayer has
      relocated;  provided,  however,  that no credit shall be allowed for the
      relocation of any retail activity or hotel services; provided,  further,
      that  no  credit shall be allowed under this subdivision to any taxpayer
      that has elected pursuant to subdivision (d) of section  22-624  of  the
      code  to  take  such  credit  against a gross receipts tax imposed under
      chapter eleven of this title. For  purposes  of  this  subdivision,  the
      terms  "eligible  aggregate  employment  shares,"  "eligible  premises,"
      "relocate," "retail  activity"  and  "hotel  services"  shall  have  the
      meanings ascribed by section 22-623 of the code.
        (b) The credit allowed under this subdivision with respect to eligible
      aggregate employment shares maintained with respect to eligible premises
      to  which  the  taxpayer  has relocated shall be allowed for the taxable
      year of the relocation and for any  of  the  twelve  succeeding  taxable
      years  during  which eligible aggregate employment shares are maintained
      with respect to eligible premises; provided that the credit allowed  for
      the  twelfth  succeeding taxable year shall be calculated by multiplying
      the number of  eligible  aggregate  employment  shares  maintained  with
      respect  to  eligible premises in the twelfth succeeding taxable year by
      the lesser of one and a fraction the numerator of which is  such  number
      of  days  in  the taxable year of relocation less the number of days the
      taxpayer maintained  employment  shares  in  eligible  premises  in  the
      taxable year of relocation and the denominator of which is the number of
      days  in  such twelfth taxable year during which such eligible aggregate
      employment shares are maintained with respect to such premises.
        (c) Except as provided in paragraph (d) of this  subdivision,  if  the
      amount  of  the  credit allowable under this subdivision for any taxable
      year exceeds the tax imposed for such year, the excess  may  be  carried
      over, in order, to the five immediately succeeding taxable years and, to
      the   extent  not  previously  deductible,  may  be  deducted  from  the
      taxpayer's tax for such years.
        (d) The credits  allowed  under  this  subdivision,  against  the  tax
      imposed  by  this chapter for the taxable year of the relocation and for
      the four taxable years immediately succeeding the taxable year  of  such
      relocation, shall be deemed to be overpayments of tax by the taxpayer to
      be  credited  or  refunded,  without  interest,  in  accordance with the
      provisions of section 11-677 of this chapter. For  such  taxable  years,
      such  credits  or  portions  thereof  may  not  be  carried  over to any
      succeeding taxable year.
        (e) The credit allowable under  this  subdivision  shall  be  deducted
      after the credits allowed by subdivisions seventeen and eighteen of this
      section,  but prior to the deduction of any other credit allowed by this
      section.
        * 20. Film production credit. (a)(1) allowance of credit.  A  taxpayer
      which  is  a  qualified film production company, and which is subject to
      tax under this subchapter, shall be allowed a credit against  such  tax,
      pursuant  to  the  provisions  in subdivision (c) of this section, to be
      computed as hereinafter provided.
        (2) The amount of the credit shall be the product of five percent  and
      the  qualified  production costs paid or incurred in the production of a
      qualified film, provided that the qualified production costs  (excluding
    
      post  production  costs)  paid or incurred which are attributable to the
      use of tangible property or the performance of services at  a  qualified
      film  production facility in the production of such qualified film equal
      or  exceed  seventy-five percent of the production costs (excluding post
      production costs) paid or incurred which are attributable to the use  of
      tangible  property or the performance of services at any film production
      facility within and without the city of New York in  the  production  of
      such   qualified  film.  However,  if  the  qualified  production  costs
      (excluding post production costs) which are attributable to the  use  of
      tangible  property  or  the  performance of services at a qualified film
      production facility in the production of such qualified  film  are  less
      than three million dollars, then the portion of the qualified production
      costs attributable to the use of tangible property or the performance of
      services in the production of such qualified film outside of a qualified
      film  production  facility  shall  be  allowed only if the shooting days
      spent in the city of New York outside of a film production  facility  in
      the  production  of  such  qualified  film  equal or exceed seventy-five
      percent of the total shooting days spent within and without the city  of
      New York outside of a film production facility in the production of such
      qualified  film.  The  credit  shall  be allowed for the taxable year in
      which the production of such qualified film is completed.
        (3) No qualified production costs used by a  taxpayer  either  as  the
      basis   for  the  allowance  of  the  credit  provided  for  under  this
      subdivision or used in the calculation of the credit provided for  under
      this  subdivision  shall  be  used  by  such taxpayer to claim any other
      credit allowed pursuant to this title.

      or any part thereof, props, makeup, wardrobe, film  processing,  camera,
      sound  recording,  set  construction,  lighting,  shooting,  editing and
      meals.
        (3) "Qualified film" means a  feature-length  film,  television  film,

      under section 2257 of title 18, United States  code,  to  be  maintained
    
      with  respect  to  any performer in such production (reporting of books,

      year  to  less  than the amount prescribed in clause (4) of subparagraph
      (a) of paragraph  E  of  subdivision  one  of  this  section.  Provided,
      however,  that  if  the  amount  of  the  credit  allowable  under  this
      subdivision for any taxable year reduces the tax to such  amount,  fifty
      percent  of  the  excess shall be treated as an overpayment of tax to be
      credited or refunded in accordance with the provisions of section 11-677
      of this chapter; provided, however, the provisions of section 11-679  of
      this  chapter  notwithstanding,  no  interest shall be paid thereon. The
      balance of such credit not credited or refunded in such taxable year may
      be carried over to the immediately succeeding taxable year  and  may  be
      credited  against  the taxpayer's tax for such year. The excess, if any,
      of the amount of the credit over the tax for such succeeding year  shall
      be  treated  as  an  overpayment  of  tax  to be credited or refunded in
      accordance with the  provisions  of  section  11-677  of  this  chapter.

      emerging technology company, engages in biotechnologies, and  meets  the
      eligibility  requirements of this subdivision, shall be allowed a credit
      against the tax imposed by this subchapter. The amount of  credit  shall
      be  equal to the sum of the amounts specified in subparagraphs (3), (4),
      and (5) of this paragraph, subject to the  limitations  in  subparagraph
      (7)  of  this  paragraph  and paragraph (b) of this subdivision. For the
      purposes of this subdivision, "qualified  emerging  technology  company"
      shall  mean  a  company  located  in city: (A) whose primary products or
      services are classified as emerging technologies and whose total  annual
      product sales are ten million dollars or less; or (B) a company that has
      research  and development activities in city and whose ratio of research
      and development funds to net sales equals or exceeds the  average  ratio
      for  all  surveyed  companies  classified  as determined by the National
      Science Foundation in the most recent published results from its  Survey
      of Industry Research and Development, or any comparable successor survey
      as  determined  by  the department, and whose total annual product sales
      are ten million dollars or less. For the purposes of  this  subdivision,
      the  definition  of  research and development funds shall be the same as
      that used by the  National  Science  Foundation  in  the  aforementioned
      survey.  For  the  purposes of this subdivision, "biotechnologies" shall
      mean the technologies involving the scientific  manipulation  of  living
    
      organisms,  especially at the molecular and/or the sub-molecular genetic
      level, to produce products conducive to improving the lives  and  health
      of  plants, animals, and humans; and the associated scientific research,
      pharmacological, mechanical, and computational applications and services
      connected   with  these  improvements.  Activities  included  with  such
      applications  and  services  shall  include,  but  not  be  limited  to,
      alternative  mRNA  splicing,  DNA  sequence  amplification,  antigenetic
      switching  bioaugmentation,  bioenrichment,  bioremediation,  chromosome
      walking,  cytogenetic  engineering,  DNA  diagnosis, fingerprinting, and
      sequencing,  electroporation,  gene  translocation,   genetic   mapping,
      site-directed    mutagenesis,   bio-transduction,   bio-mechanical   and
      bio-electrical engineering, and bio-informatics.
        (2) An eligible taxpayer shall (A)  have  no  more  than  one  hundred
      full-time employees, of which at least seventy-five percent are employed
      in  the  city, (B) have a ratio of research and development funds to net
      sales, as referred to in section thirty-one hundred two-e of the  public
      authorities law, which equals or exceeds six percent during the calendar
      year  ending  with  or  within  the taxable year for which the credit is
      claimed, and (C) have gross revenues, along with the gross  revenues  of
      its  "affiliates"  and  "related  members"  not exceeding twenty million
      dollars for the calendar year immediately preceding  the  calendar  year
      ending  with or within the taxable year for which the credit is claimed.
      For the purposes of this  subdivision,  "affiliates"  shall  mean  those
      corporations  that  are members of the same affiliated group (as defined
      in section fifteen hundred four of the internal  revenue  code)  as  the
      taxpayer.  For  the  purposes  of  this  subdivision,  the term "related
      members" shall mean a person, corporation, or other entity, including an
      entity that is treated as a partnership or  other  pass-through  vehicle
      for  purposes  of  federal taxation, whether such person, corporation or
      entity is a taxpayer or not,  where  one  such  person,  corporation  or
      entity, or set of related persons, corporations or entities, directly or
      indirectly  owns  or  controls a controlling interest in another entity.
      Such entity or entities may include all taxpayers under  chapters  five,
      eleven  and  seventeen  of  this title, and subchapters two and three of
      this chapter. A controlling interest  shall  mean,  in  the  case  of  a
      corporation,  either thirty percent or more of the total combined voting
      power of all classes of stock of such corporation, or thirty percent  or
      more of the capital, profits or beneficial interest in such voting stock
      of  such  corporation;  and  in  the case of a partnership, association,
      trust or other entity, thirty percent or more of the capital, profits or
      beneficial interest in such partnership,  association,  trust  or  other
      entity.
        (3)  An  eligible  taxpayer shall be allowed a credit for eighteen per
      centum of the cost or other basis for federal  income  tax  purposes  of
      research  and  development  property that is acquired by the taxpayer by
      purchase as defined in section 179(d) of the internal revenue  code  and
      placed  in service during the calendar year that ends with or within the
      taxable year for which the credit is claimed. Provided, however, for the
      purposes of this paragraph only, an eligible taxpayer shall be allowed a
      credit for such percentage of the (A) cost or other  basis  for  federal
      income  tax  purposes  for property used in the testing or inspection of
      materials and products,  (B)  the  costs  or  expenses  associated  with
      quality  control  of  the  research and development, (C) fees for use of
      sophisticated technology facilities and processes, and (D) fees for  the
      production or eventual commercial distribution of materials and products
      resulting  from  the  activities of an eligible taxpayer as long as such
      activities fall under activities relating to biotechnologies. The costs,
      expenses and other amounts for which a credit  is  allowed  and  claimed
    
      under  this  paragraph shall not be used in the calculation of any other
      credit  allowed  under  this  subchapter.  For  the  purposes  of   this
      subdivision,  "research  and  development  property" shall mean property
      that   is   used  for  purposes  of  research  and  development  in  the
      experimental or laboratory sense. Such purposes shall not be  deemed  to
      include  the ordinary testing or inspection of materials or products for
      quality  control,  efficiency  surveys,  management  studies,   consumer
      surveys,   advertising,  promotions,  or  research  in  connection  with
      literary, historical or similar projects.
        (4) An eligible taxpayer shall be allowed a credit for nine per centum
      of qualified research expenses paid or incurred by the taxpayer  in  the
      calendar  year  that  ends with or within the taxable year for which the
      credit is claimed. For the  purposes  of  this  subdivision,  "qualified
      research expenses" shall mean expenses associated with in-house research
      and  processes,  and  costs  associated  with  the  dissemination of the
      results of the products that directly  result  from  such  research  and
      development  activities;  provided,  however,  that such costs shall not
      include advertising or  promotion  through  media.  In  addition,  costs
      associated   with   the   preparation  of  patent  applications,  patent
      application filing fees, patent research fees, patent examinations fees,
      patent  post  allowance  fees,  patent  maintenance  fees,   and   grant
      application  expenses  and  fees  shall  qualify  as  qualified research
      expenses. In no case shall the credit allowed  under  this  subparagraph
      apply  to  expenses  for litigation or the challenge of another entity's
      intellectual property rights, or for contract expenses involving outside
      paid consultants.
        (5) An eligible taxpayer shall  be  allowed  a  credit  for  qualified
      high-technology  training expenditures as described in this subparagraph
      paid or incurred by the taxpayer during the calendar year that ends with
      or within the taxable year for which the credit is claimed.
        (A) The amount of credit shall be one hundred percent of the  training
      expenses  described  in  clause  (C)  of this subparagraph, subject to a
      limitation of no more  than  four  thousand  dollars  per  employee  per
      calendar year for such training expenses.
        (B)  Qualified  high-technology  training  shall  include  a course or
      courses taken  and  satisfactorily  completed  by  an  employee  of  the
      taxpayer  at  an  accredited,  degree granting post-secondary college or
      university  in  city  that  (i)  directly   relates   to   biotechnology
      activities,  and  (ii)  is  intended  to upgrade, retrain or improve the
      productivity or theoretical awareness of the employee.  Such  course  or
      courses  may  include,  but  are not limited to, instruction or research
      relating to techniques, meta, macro, or micro-theoretical  or  practical
      knowledge  bases  or  frontiers,  or  ethical  concerns  related to such
      activities. Such course or courses shall  not  include  classes  in  the
      disciplines  of  management, accounting or the law or any class designed
      to fulfill the discipline specific requirements of a degree  program  at
      the  associate,  baccalaureate,  graduate or professional level of these
      disciplines. Satisfactory completion of a course or courses  shall  mean
      the  earning  and  granting  of  credit  or  equivalent  unit,  with the
      attainment of a grade of "B" or higher in a  graduate  level  course  or
      courses,  a  grade  of "C" or higher in an undergraduate level course or
      courses, or a similar measure of competency for a  course  that  is  not
      measured according to a standard grade formula.
        (C)  Qualified  high-technology  training  expenditures  shall include
      expenses for tuition  and  mandatory  fees,  software  required  by  the
      institution,  fees  for  textbooks  or  other literature required by the
      institution  offering  the   course   or   courses,   minus   applicable
      scholarships  and  tuition or fee waivers not granted by the taxpayer or
    
      any affiliates of the taxpayer, that  are  paid  or  reimbursed  by  the
      taxpayer. Qualified high-technology expenditures do not include room and
      board,  computer hardware or software not specifically assigned for such
      course  or  courses,  late-charges, fines or membership dues and similar
      expenses. Such qualified expenditures shall  not  be  eligible  for  the
      credit  provided  by  this  section  unless  the  employee  for whom the
      expenditures are disbursed is continuously employed by the taxpayer in a
      full-time, full-year position primarily  located  at  a  qualified  site
      during  the  period  of such coursework and lasting through at least one
      hundred eighty days after the satisfactory completion of the  qualifying
      course-work.  Qualified  high-technology training expenditures shall not
      include expenses for in-house or  shared  training  outside  of  a  city
      higher education institution or the use of consultants outside of credit
      granting  courses,  whether  such  consultants  function  inside of such
      higher education institution or not.
        (D) If a  taxpayer  relocates  from  an  academic  business  incubator
      facility   partnered   with   an   accredited  post-secondary  education
      institution located within  city,  which  provides  space  and  business
      support  services  to taxpayers, to another site, the credit provided in
      this subdivision shall be allowed for  all  expenditures  referenced  in
      clause  (C)  of  this subparagraph paid or incurred in the two preceding
      calendar years that the  taxpayer  was  located  in  such  an  incubator
      facility  for  employees  of  the  taxpayer  who also relocate from said
      incubator facility to such city site  and  are  employed  and  primarily
      located by the taxpayer in city.  Such expenditures in the two preceding
      years  shall be added to the amounts otherwise qualifying for the credit
      provided by this subdivision that were paid or incurred in the  calendar
      year that the taxpayer relocates from such a facility. Such expenditures
      shall include expenses paid for an eligible employee who is a full-time,
      full-year  employee  of  said taxpayer during the calendar year that the
      taxpayer relocated from an incubator facility notwithstanding  (i)  that
      such employee was employed full or part-time as an officer, staff-person
      or  paid  intern  of the taxpayer when such taxpayer was located at such
      incubator facility or (ii)  that  such  employee  was  not  continuously
      employed when such taxpayer was located at the incubator facility during
      the  one  hundred  eighty  day  period referred to in clause (C) of this
      subparagraph, provided such employee received wages or equivalent income
      for at least seven hundred fifty  hours  during  any  twenty-four  month
      period  when  the  taxpayer  was located at the incubator facility. Such
      expenditures shall include payments made  to  such  employee  after  the
      taxpayer  has  relocated  from  the  incubator  facility  for  qualified
      expenditures if such payments are made  to  reimburse  an  employee  for
      expenditures  paid  by the employee during such two preceding years. The
      credit provided under this paragraph shall be  allowed  in  any  taxable
      year that the taxpayer qualifies as an eligible taxpayer.
        (E)  For  purposes  of this subdivision the term "academic year" shall
      mean the annual period  of  sessions  of  a  post-secondary  college  or
      university.
        (F)  For the purposes of this subdivision the term "academic incubator
      facility" shall mean a  facility  providing  low-cost  space,  technical
      assistance,  support  services  and educational opportunities, including
      but not limited to central services  provided  by  the  manager  of  the
      facility  to  the tenants of the facility, to an entity located in city.
      Such entity's primary activity must  be  in  biotechnologies,  and  such
      entity  must  be  in  the  formative  stage of development. The academic
      incubator facility and the  entity  must  act  in  partnership  with  an
      accredited  post-secondary  college  or  university  located in city. An
      academic incubator facility's mission shall be to promote job  creation,
    
      entrepreneurship,  technology  transfer, and provide support services to
      incubator tenants, including, but not  limited  to,  business  planning,
      management   assistance,   financial-packaging,  linkages  to  financing
      services, and coordinating with other sources of assistance.
        (6)  An eligible taxpayer may claim credits under this subdivision for
      three consecutive years. In no case shall the  credit  allowed  by  this
      subdivision  to a taxpayer exceed two hundred fifty thousand dollars per
      calendar year for eligible expenditures made during such calendar year.
        (7) The credit allowed under this subdivision  for  any  taxable  year
      shall  not  reduce  the  tax  due  for such year to less than the amount
      prescribed  in  clause  (4)  of  subparagraph  (a)  of  paragraph  E  of
      subdivision  one  of  this  section. Provided, however, if the amount of
      credit allowed under this subdivision for any taxable year  reduces  the
      tax  to such amount, any amount of credit not deductible in such taxable
      year shall be treated as  an  overpayment  of  tax  to  be  credited  or
      refunded  in  accordance  with  the provisions of section 11-677 of this
      chapter; provided,  however,  that  notwithstanding  the  provisions  of
      section 11-679 of this chapter, no interest shall be paid thereon.
        (8)  The  credit  allowed under this subdivision shall only be allowed
      for taxable years beginning on or after January first, two thousand  ten
      and before January first, two thousand sixteen.
        (b)  (1) The percentage of the credit allowed to a taxpayer under this
      subdivision in any calendar year shall be:
        (A) If the average number of  individuals  employed  full  time  by  a
      taxpayer  in  the city during the calendar year that ends with or within
      the taxable year for which the credit is claimed is at least one hundred
      five percent  of  the  taxpayer's  base  year  employment,  one  hundred
      percent,  except  that  in  no  case shall the credit allowed under this
      clause exceed two hundred fifty  thousand  dollars  per  calendar  year.
      Provided,  however, the increase in base year employment shall not apply
      to a taxpayer allowed a credit under  this  subdivision  that  was,  (i)
      located  outside  of the city, (ii) not doing business, or (iii) did not
      have any employees, in the year preceding the first year that the credit
      is claimed. Any such taxpayer shall be eligible for one hundred  percent
      of  the  credit for the first calendar year that ends with or within the
      taxable year for  which  the  credit  is  claimed,  provided  that  such
      taxpayer locates in the city, begins doing business in the city or hires
      employees  in  the  city  during  such  calendar  year  and is otherwise
      eligible for the credit pursuant to the provisions of this subdivision.
        (B) If the average number of  individuals  employed  full  time  by  a
      taxpayer  in  the city during the calendar year that ends with or within
      the taxable year for which the  credit  is  claimed  is  less  than  one
      hundred  five  percent  of  the  taxpayer's  base year employment, fifty
      percent, except that in no case shall  the  credit  allowed  under  this
      clause  exceed  one  hundred  twenty  five thousand dollars per calendar
      year. In the case of an entity  located  in  city  receiving  space  and
      business  support  services  by  an  academic incubator facility, if the
      average number of individuals employed full time by such entity  in  the
      city  during  the  calendar  year in which the credit allowed under this
      subdivision is claimed is less than one  hundred  five  percent  of  the
      taxpayer's base year employment, the credit shall be zero.
        (2) For the purposes of this subdivision, "base year employment" means
      the  average number of individuals employed full-time by the taxpayer in
      the city in the year preceding the first calendar year that ends with or
      within the taxable year for which the credit is claimed.
        (3)  For  the  purposes  of  this  subdivision,  average   number   of
      individuals employed full-time shall be computed by adding the number of
      such  individuals  employed  by  the taxpayer at the end of each quarter
    
      during each calendar year or other applicable period  and  dividing  the
      sum  so  obtained  by  the number of such quarters occurring within such
      calendar year or other applicable period.
        (4)   Notwithstanding  anything  contained  in  this  section  to  the
      contrary, the credit provided  by  this  subdivision  shall  be  allowed
      against  the taxes authorized by this chapter for the taxable year after
      reduction by all other credits permitted by this chapter.

      representative within the  city,  shall  annually  on  or  before  March
      fifteenth,  transmit  to  the commissioner of finance a report in a form
      prescribed by the commissioner (except that a corporation which  reports
      on  the  basis of a fiscal year shall transmit its report within two and
      one-half months after the close of its fiscal year), setting forth  such
      information  as  the  commissioner  of  finance  may prescribe and every
      taxpayer which ceases to do business in the city or to be subject to the
      tax imposed by this subchapter shall transmit  to  the  commissioner  of
      finance  a report on the date of such cessation or at such other time as
      the commissioner may require covering each year or period for  which  no
      report  was  theretofore  filed. Every taxpayer shall also transmit such
      other reports and such facts and  information  as  the  commissioner  of
      finance  may  require  in  the  administration  of  this subchapter. The
      commissioner of finance may grant a reasonable  extension  of  time  for
      filing reports whenever good cause exists.
        With  respect  to taxable years ending prior to December thirty-first,
      nineteen hundred sixty-six, the returns required to be  made  and  filed
      pursuant  to  this  section  shall  be  made  and filed on or before the
      fifteenth day of the third month following the  close  of  such  taxable
      year  or  September  eleventh,  nineteen hundred sixty-six, whichever is
      later.
        * An automatic extension of six months for the filing  of  its  annual
      report  shall  be allowed any taxpayer if, within the time prescribed by
      either of  the  preceding  paragraphs,  whichever  is  applicable,  such
      taxpayer  files  with  the  commissioner  of  finance an application for
      extension in such form as the commissioner may prescribe  by  regulation
      and  pays  on  or  before  the  date  of such filing the amount properly

        2. Every report shall have annexed  thereto  a  certification  by  the
      president,   vice-president,   treasurer,   assistant  treasurer,  chief
      accounting officer or another officer of the taxpayer duly authorized so
      to act to the effect that the statements contained therein are true.  In
      the  case  of  an  association, within the meaning of paragraph three of
      section (a) of section seventy-seven hundred one of the internal revenue
      code,  a  publicly-traded  partnership  treated  as  a  corporation  for
      purposes  of the internal revenue code pursuant to section seventy-seven
      hundred four thereof and any business conducted by a trustee or trustees
      wherein interest or ownership is  evidenced  by  certificates  or  other
      written instruments, such certification shall be made by any person duly
      authorized  so  to  act  on  behalf of such association, publicly-traded
      partnership or business. The fact that an individual's name is signed on
      a certification of the report shall be prima facie  evidence  that  such
      individual is authorized to sign and certify the report on behalf of the
      corporation.   Blank   forms  of  reports  shall  be  furnished  by  the
      commissioner of finance, on application, but failure to  secure  such  a
      blank  shall  not  release any corporation from the obligation of making
      any report required by this subchapter.
        2-a.  The  commissioner  of  finance  may  prescribe  regulations  and
      instructions  requiring  returns  of information to be made and filed in
      conjunction with the reports required  to  be  filed  pursuant  to  this
      section,  relating  to payments made to shareholders owning, directly or
      indirectly, individually or in the aggregate, more than fifty percent of
      the issued capital stock  of  the  taxpayer,  where  such  payments  are
      treated  as payments of interest in the computation of entire net income
      reported on such reports.

      or other basis  of  tax  for  any  year  of  any  taxpayer,  or  of  any
      shareholder  of  any  taxpayer  which  has  elected  to  be  taxed under
      subchapter s of chapter one of the  internal  revenue  code  or  of  any
      shareholder  of  any taxpayer with respect to which an election has been
      made to  be  treated  as  a  qualified  subchapter  s  subsidiary  under
      paragraph  three of subsection (b) of section thirteen hundred sixty-one
      of the internal revenue code, as returned to the United States  treasury
      department or the New York state commissioner of taxation and finance is
      changed  or  corrected  by the commissioner of internal revenue or other
      officer of the United States or  the  New  York  state  commissioner  of
      taxation   and   finance  or  other  competent  authority,  or  where  a
      renegotiation of a contract or subcontract with the United States or the
      state of New York results in a change  in  taxable  income,  alternative
      minimum  taxable  income or other basis of tax, or where a recovery of a
      war loss results in a computation or recomputation of any tax imposed by
      the United States or the state of New York, or if  a  taxpayer  or  such
      shareholder  of  a  taxpayer,  pursuant  to  subsection  (d)  of section
      sixty-two hundred thirteen of the  internal  revenue  code,  executes  a
      notice  of waiver of the restrictions provided in subsection (a) of said
      section, or if a taxpayer, or such shareholder of a  taxpayer,  pursuant
      to  subsection  (f)  of  section one thousand eighty-one of the tax law,
      executes a notice of waiver of the restrictions provided  in  subsection
      (c)  of  said  section,  such  taxpayer  shall  report  such  changed or
      corrected taxable income, alternative minimum taxable  income  or  other
      basis of tax, or the results of such renegotiation, or such computation,
      or  recomputation,  or  such  execution of such notice of waiver and the
      changes or corrections of the  taxpayer's  federal  or  New  York  state
      taxable income, alternative minimum taxable income or other basis of tax
      on which it is based, within ninety days (or one hundred twenty days, in
      the  case  of  a taxpayer making a combined report under this subchapter
      for such year) after such execution or the final determination  of  such
      change   or   correction  or  renegotiation,  or  such  computation,  or
      recomputation, or as required by the commissioner of finance, and  shall
      concede  the  accuracy  of  such  determination  or  state wherein it is
      erroneous. The allowance of a tentative carryback adjustment based  upon
      a net operating loss carryback or net capital loss carryback pursuant to
      section  sixty-four hundred eleven of the internal revenue code shall be
      treated as a final determination for purposes of this  subdivision.  Any
      taxpayer  filing  an amended return with such department shall also file
      within ninety days thereafter an amended report with the commissioner of
      finance.
        4. (a)  Any  taxpayer  which  owns  or  controls  either  directly  or
      indirectly  substantially  all  the  capital  stock of one or more other
      corporations, or substantially all the capital stock of which  is  owned
      or  controlled  either  directly  or  indirectly  by  one  or more other
      corporations or by interests which own or  control  either  directly  or
      indirectly  substantially  all  the  capital  stock of one or more other
      corporations, (hereinafter referred to in  this  paragraph  as  "related
      corporations"),  shall  make  a  combined  report  covering  any related
      corporations if there are substantial intercorporate transactions  among
      the  related  corporations,  regardless  of  the transfer price for such
      intercorporate  transactions.  It  is  not  necessary  that   there   be
      substantial  intercorporate transactions between any one corporation and
      every other related corporation. It is necessary, however, that there be
      substantial intercorporate  transactions  between  the  taxpayer  and  a
      related   corporation   or,   collectively,  a  group  of  such  related
    
      corporations. The  report  shall  set  forth  such  information  as  the
      commissioner of finance may require.
        In   determining   whether   there   are   substantial  intercorporate
      transactions,  the  commissioner  shall  consider   and   evaluate   all
      activities   and   transactions   of   the   taxpayer  and  its  related
      corporations.  Activities  and  transactions  that  will  be  considered
      include,  but  are  not  limited  to:  manufacturing, acquiring goods or
      property, or performing  services,  for  related  corporations;  selling
      goods  acquired  from  related  corporations; financing sales of related
      corporations;  performing  related  customer   services   using   common
      facilities  and  employees  for related corporations; incurring expenses
      that benefit, directly or indirectly, one or more related  corporations;
      and  transferring  assets, including such assets as accounts receivable,
      patents or trademarks from one or more related corporations.
        (1) No taxpayer may be permitted to make a report on a combined  basis
      covering  any  such  other  corporations where such taxpayer or any such
      other  corporation  allocates  in  accordance   with   clause   (A)   of
      subparagraph six of paragraph (a) of subdivision three of section 11-604
      of  this subchapter and such taxpayer or any such other corporation does
      not so allocate.
        (2) No taxpayer may be permitted to make a report on a combined  basis
      covering  any  such  other  corporations where such taxpayer or any such
      other corporation allocates in accordance  with  subparagraph  seven  of
      paragraph  (a) of subdivision three of section 11-604 of this subchapter
      and such taxpayer or any such other corporation does not so allocate.
        (3) Except as provided in the first  undesignated  paragraph  of  this
      subdivision,  no combined report covering any corporation not a taxpayer
      shall be required unless the commissioner of finance deems such a report
      necessary, because of  inter-company  transactions  or  some  agreement,
      understanding,  arrangement  or  transaction  referred to in subdivision
      five of this section, in order properly to  reflect  the  tax  liability
      under this subchapter.
        (4) A corporation organized under the laws of a country other than the
      United  States  shall not be required or permitted to make a report on a
      combined basis.
        (5)(i)  For  purposes  of  this  subparagraph,   the   term   "closest
      controlling  stockholder"  means the corporation that indirectly owns or
      controls over fifty percent of the voting stock of  a  captive  REIT  or
      captive  RIC,  is  subject  to  tax  under  this subchapter or otherwise
      required to be included in a combined report under this subchapter,  and
      is the fewest tiers of corporations away in the ownership structure from
      the  captive  REIT  or  captive  RIC.  The commissioner is authorized to
      prescribe  by  regulation  or  published  guidance  the   criteria   for
      determining the closest controlling stockholder.
        (ii)  A  captive  REIT or a captive RIC must be included in a combined
      report with the corporation that directly owns or  controls  over  fifty
      percent  of  the voting stock of the captive REIT or captive RIC if that
      corporation is subject to tax or required to be included in  a  combined
      report under this subchapter.
        (iii)  If  over fifty percent of the voting stock of a captive REIT or
      captive RIC is not directly owned or controlled by a corporation that is
      subject to tax or required to be included in  a  combined  report  under
      this  subchapter,  then the captive REIT or captive RIC must be included
      in  a  combined  report  with  the  corporation  that  is  the   closest
      controlling  stockholder  of  the  captive  REIT  or captive RIC. If the
      closest controlling stockholder of the captive REIT or  captive  RIC  is
      subject to tax or otherwise required to be included in a combined report
    
      under  this  subchapter,  then  the  captive REIT or captive RIC must be
      included in a combined report under this subchapter.
        (iv)  If  the  corporation  that  directly owns or controls the voting
      stock of the captive REIT or captive RIC is  described  in  subparagraph
      one,  two  or  four  of this paragraph as a corporation not permitted to
      make a combined report, then the provisions  in  clause  (iii)  of  this
      subparagraph  must  be  applied  to  determine  the corporation in whose
      combined report the captive REIT or captive RIC should be included.  If,
      under  clause  (iii)  of  this subparagraph, the corporation that is the
      closest controlling stockholder of the captive REIT or  captive  RIC  is
      described  in  subparagraph  one,  two  or  four  of this paragraph as a
      corporation  not  permitted  to  make  a  combined  report,  then   that
      corporation  is  deemed  to  not  be  in  the ownership structure of the
      captive REIT or captive RIC, and  the  closest  controlling  stockholder
      will be determined without regard to that corporation.
        (v)  If  a  captive REIT owns the stock of a qualified REIT subsidiary
      (as defined in paragraph two of subsection (i) of section eight  hundred
      fifty-six  of  the  internal  revenue  code),  then  the  qualified REIT
      subsidiary must be included in a combined report with the captive REIT.
        (vi) If a captive REIT  or  a  captive  RIC  is  required  under  this
      subparagraph   to   be  included  in  a  combined  report  with  another
      corporation, and that other corporation is also required to be  included
      in  a  combined  report with another related corporation or corporations
      under this paragraph, then the captive REIT or the captive RIC  must  be
      included in that combined report with those corporations.
        (vii)  If  a  captive  REIT  or  a  captive  RIC is not required to be
      included in a combined report with another corporation under clause (ii)
      or (iii) of this  subparagraph,  or  in  a  combined  return  under  the
      provisions  of  subparagraph  (v) of paragraph two of subdivision (f) of
      section 11-646 of this chapter, then the captive REIT or captive RIC  is
      subject  to  the opening provisions of this paragraph and the provisions
      of subparagraph three of this paragraph. The captive REIT or captive RIC
      must be included in a combined report under this subchapter with another
      corporation  if  either  the  substantial  intercorporate   transactions
      requirement   in  the  opening  provisions  of  this  paragraph  or  the
      inter-company transactions or agreement, understanding,  arrangement  or
      transaction  requirement  of  subparagraph  three  of  this paragraph is
      satisfied and more than fifty percent of the voting stock of the captive
      REIT or the captive RIC and substantially all of the  capital  stock  of
      that other corporation are owned and controlled, directly or indirectly,
      by the same corporation.
        (b)(1)(i)  In  the case of a combined report the tax shall be measured
      by the combined entire  net  income  or  combined  capital  of  all  the
      corporations  included  in  the  report,  including  any captive REIT or
      captive RIC; provided, however, in no event shall the  tax  measured  by
      combined  capital  exceed  the limitation provided for in paragraph F of
      subdivision one of section 11-604 of this subchapter.
        (ii) In the case of a captive REIT or captive RIC required under  this
      subdivision  to be included in a combined report, entire net income must
      be computed as required under  subdivision  seven  (in  the  case  of  a
      captive  REIT)  or  subdivision  eight (in the case of a captive RIC) of
      section 11-603  of  this  chapter.  However,  the  deduction  under  the
      internal  revenue code for dividends paid by the captive REIT or captive
      RIC to any member of the affiliated group that includes the  corporation
      that  directly or indirectly owns over fifty percent of the voting stock
      of the captive REIT or captive RIC shall  not  be  allowed  for  taxable
      years  beginning  on or after January first, two thousand nine. The term
      "affiliated group"  means  "affiliated  group"  as  defined  in  section
    
      fifteen hundred four of the internal revenue code, but without regard to
      the exceptions provided for in subsection (b) of that section.
        (2)  In  computing combined entire net income intercorporate dividends
      shall be eliminated,  in  computing  combined  business  and  investment
      capital  intercorporate  stock  holdings and intercorporate bills, notes
      and  accounts  receivable   and   payable   and   other   intercorporate
      indebtedness  shall  be  eliminated and in computing combined subsidiary
      capital intercorporate stockholdings shall be eliminated.
        5. In case it shall appear to the commissioner  of  finance  that  any
      agreement,  understanding or arrangement exists between the taxpayer and
      any other corporation or any  person  or  firm,  whereby  the  activity,
      business,  income  or  capital  of  the  taxpayer  within  the  city  is
      improperly or inaccurately reflected, the  commissioner  of  finance  is
      authorized and empowered, in its discretion and in such manner as it may
      determine,  to  adjust  items  of income, deductions and capital, and to
      eliminate assets in computing any allocation  percentage  provided  only
      that  any income directly traceable thereto be also excluded from entire
      net income, so as equitably to determine the tax. Where (a) any taxpayer
      conducts its activity or business under any  agreement,  arrangement  or
      understanding in such manner as either directly or indirectly to benefit
      its  members  or  stockholders, or any of them, or any person or persons
      directly or indirectly interested  in  such  activity  or  business,  by
      entering  into  any transaction at more or less than a fair price which,
      but for such agreement, arrangement or understanding,  might  have  been
      paid or received therefor, or (b) any taxpayer, a substantial portion of
      whose  capital  stock  is owned either directly or indirectly by another
      corporation, enters into any transaction with such other corporation  on
      such terms as to create an improper loss or net income, the commissioner
      of finance may include in the entire net income of the taxpayer the fair
      profits,  which,  but  for such agreement, arrangement or understanding,
      the taxpayer might have derived from such transaction.
        6. An action may be brought at any time by the corporation counsel  at
      the  instance  of  the  commissioner  of finance to compel the filing of
      reports due under this subchapter.
        7. Reports shall be preserved for five years, and thereafter until the
      commissioner of finance orders them to be destroyed.
        8. Where the state tax commission changes  or  corrects  a  taxpayer's
      sales and compensating use tax liability with respect to the purchase or
      use  of  items  for which a sales or compensating use tax credit against
      the tax imposed by this chapter was claimed, the taxpayer  shall  report
      such  change  or correction to the commissioner of finance within ninety
      days of the final determination of such  change  or  correction,  or  as
      required  by the commissioner of finance, and shall concede the accuracy
      of such determination or state wherein it  is  erroneous.  Any  taxpayer
      filing  an  amended  return or report relating to the purchase or use of
      such items shall also file within ninety days thereafter a copy of  such
      amended return or report with the commissioner of finance.

Section 11-606 ::    
        
     
        ยง  11-606 Payment and lien of tax. 1. To the extent the tax imposed by
      section 11-603 of this subchapter shall not have  been  previously  paid
      pursuant to section 11-608 of this subchapter,
        (a)  such  tax,  or  the  balance  thereof,  shall  be  payable to the
      commissioner of finance in full at the time the report is required to be
      filed, and
        (b) such tax, or the balance thereof, imposed on  any  taxpayer  which
      ceases to do business in the city or to be subject to the tax imposed by
      this  subchapter  shall be payable to the commissioner of finance at the
      time the report is required to be filed; all other  taxes  of  any  such
      taxpayer,  which  pursuant  to  the foregoing provisions of this section
      would otherwise be  payable  subsequent  to  the  time  such  report  is
      required to be filed, shall nevertheless be payable at such time.
        If  the taxpayer, within the time prescribed by section 11-605 of this
      subchapter, shall have applied for an automatic  extension  of  time  to
      file  its  annual  report  and  shall  have  paid to the commissioner of
      finance on or before the  date  such  application  is  filed  an  amount
      properly  estimated as provided by said section, the only amount payable
      in addition to the tax shall be interest at the underpayment rate set by
      the commissioner of finance pursuant to section 11-687 of this  chapter,
      or,  if  no  rate  is set, at the rate of seven and one-half percent per
      annum upon the amount by which the tax, or the portion  thereof  payable
      on  or  before the date the report was required to be filed, exceeds the
      amount so paid. For purposes of the preceding sentence:
        (1) an amount so paid shall be deemed  properly  estimated  if  it  is
      either:  (A)  not  less  than  ninety  percent  of  the  tax  as finally
      determined (computed  without  regard  to  any  credit  allowable  under
      subdivision  eleven  of  section  11-604 of this subchapter), or (B) not
      less than the tax shown (computed without regard to any credit allowable
      under subdivision eleven of section 11-604 of this  subchapter)  on  the
      taxpayer's report for the preceding taxable year, if such preceding year
      was a taxable year of twelve months; and
        (2) the time when a report is required to be filed shall be determined
      without regard to any extension of time for filing such report.
        2.  The  commissioner  of  finance may grant a reasonable extension of
      time for payment of any  tax  imposed  by  this  subchapter  under  such
      conditions as it deems just and proper.
        3. Subdivision one of this section shall apply to a taxpayer which has
      a  right to a credit pursuant to subdivision eleven of section 11-604 of
      this subchapter, except that the tax, or balance thereof, payable to the
      commissioner of finance in full pursuant  to  subdivision  one  of  this
      section,  at  the  time  the  report  is  required to be filed, shall be
      calculated and paid at such time  as  if  the  credit  provided  for  in
      subdivision  eleven  of  section  11-604  of  this  subchapter  were not
      allowed.

Section 11-607 ::    
        
     
        ยง  11-607  Declaration  of estimated tax. 1. Every taxpayer subject to
      the tax imposed by section  11-603  of  this  subchapter  shall  make  a
      declaration  of  its  estimated  tax  for  the current privilege period,
      containing such information as the commissioner of finance may prescribe
      by regulations or instructions, if such estimated tax can reasonably  be
      expected to exceed one thousand dollars.
        2.  The  term  "estimated  tax"  means  the  amount  which  a taxpayer
      estimates to be the tax imposed by section 11-603 of this subchapter for
      the current privilege period, less the amount which it estimates  to  be
      the  sum  of any credits allowable against the tax other than the credit
      allowable under subdivision eleven of section 11-604 of this subchapter.
        3. In the case of a taxpayer which reports on the basis of a  calendar
      year,  a  declaration  of estimated tax shall be filed on or before June
      fifteenth  of  the  current  privilege  period,  except  that   if   the
      requirements of subdivision one are first met:
        (a)  after May thirty-first and before September first of such current
      privilege period, the declaration shall be filed on or before  September
      fifteenth, or
        (b)  after  August  thirty-first  and  before  December  first of such
      current privilege period, the declaration shall be filed  on  or  before
      December fifteenth.
        4.  A  taxpayer  may  amend  a  declaration  under  regulations of the
      commissioner of finance.
        5. If, on or before February fifteenth of the succeeding year  in  the
      case  of  a  taxpayer  which  reports on the basis of a calendar year, a
      taxpayer files its report for the year  for  which  the  declaration  is
      required,  and pays therewith the balance, if any, of the full amount of
      the tax shown to be due on the report,
        (a)  such  report  shall  be  considered  as  its  declaration  if  no
      declaration  is  required to be filed during the calendar or fiscal year
      for which the tax was imposed, but is otherwise required to be filed  on
      or before December fifteenth pursuant to subdivision three, and
        (b)  such  report  shall  be  considered as the amendment permitted by
      subdivision four to be filed on or before December fifteenth if the  tax
      shown  on  the  report  is  greater  than  the  estimated tax shown on a
      declaration previously made.
        6. This section shall apply to  privilege  periods  of  twelve  months
      other  than  a  calendar  year by the substitution of the months of such
      fiscal year for the corresponding months specified in this section.
        7. If the privilege period for which  a  tax  is  imposed  by  section
      11-603  of  this  subchapter  is less than twelve months, every taxpayer
      required to make a declaration  of  estimated  tax  for  such  privilege
      period  shall  make such a declaration in accordance with regulations of
      the commissioner of finance.
        8. The commissioner of finance may grant  a  reasonable  extension  of
      time,  not  to  exceed  three  months, for the filing of any declaration
      required pursuant to this section, on such terms and  conditions  as  it
      may require.

Section 11-608 ::    
        
     
        ยง  11-608  Payments  on  account of estimated tax.   1. Every taxpayer
      subject to the tax imposed by section 11-603 of  this  subchapter  shall
      pay  with  the  report  required to be filed for the preceding privilege
      period, if any, or with an application for extension  of  the  time  and
      filing  such  report,  an  amount equal to twenty-five per centum of the
      preceding year's tax if such preceding year's tax exceeded one  thousand
      dollars.
        2.  The  estimated  tax  with  respect to which a declaration for such
      privilege period is required shall be paid, in the case  of  a  taxpayer
      which reports on the basis of a calendar year, as follows:
        (a)  If  the  declaration  is  filed  on or before June fifteenth, the
      estimated tax shown thereon, after applying thereto the amount, if  any,
      paid during the same privilege period pursuant to subdivision one, shall
      be  paid  in three equal installments. One of such installments shall be
      paid at the time of the filing of the declaration, one shall be paid  on
      the  following  September  fifteenth,  and one on the following December
      fifteenth.
        (b) If the declaration is filed after June  fifteenth  and  not  after
      September  fifteenth of such privilege period, and is not required to be
      filed on or before June fifteenth of  such  period,  the  estimated  tax
      shown  on  such  declaration, after applying thereto the amount, if any,
      paid during the same privilege period pursuant to subdivision one, shall
      be paid in two equal installments. One of  such  installments  shall  be
      paid  at the time of the filing of the declaration and one shall be paid
      on the following December fifteenth.
        (c) If the declaration is filed  after  September  fifteenth  of  such
      privilege period, and is not required to be filed on or before September
      fifteenth  of  such  privilege  period,  the estimated tax shown on such
      declaration, after applying thereto the amount, if any, paid in  respect
      to  such  privilege period pursuant to subdivision one, shall be paid in
      full at the time of the filing of the declaration.
        (d) If the declaration is filed after the time prescribed therefor, or
      after the expiration of any extension of time therefor,  paragraphs  (b)
      and  (c) of this subdivision shall not apply, and there shall be paid at
      the time of such filing all installments of estimated tax payable at  or
      before  such  time,  and the remaining installments shall be paid at the
      times at which, and in the  amounts  in  which,  they  would  have  been
      payable if the declaration had been filed when due.
        3.  If  any  amendment  of  a  declaration  is  filed,  the  remaining
      installments, if any, shall be ratably increased or  decreased  (as  the
      case may be) to reflect any increase or decrease in the estimated tax by
      reason  of  such amendment, and if any amendment is made after September
      fifteenth of the privilege period, any increase in the estimated tax  by
      reason thereof shall be paid at the time of making such amendment.
        4.  Any  amount  paid  shall  be  applied  after  payment  as  a first
      installment against the estimated tax of the taxpayer  for  the  current
      privilege  period shown on the declaration required to be filed pursuant
      to section 11-607 of this subchapter or, if no declaration of  estimated
      tax  is  required  to be filed by the taxpayer to such section, any such
      amount shall be considered a payment on account of the tax shown on  the
      report required to be filed by the taxpayer for such privilege period.
        5. Notwithstanding the provisions of section 11-679 of this chapter or
      of  section  three-a  of  the  general  municipal law, if an amount paid
      pursuant to subdivision one exceeds the tax shown on the report required
      to be filed by the taxpayer for the privilege period  during  which  the
      amount  was  paid,  interest  shall be allowed and paid on the amount by
      which the amount so paid pursuant to such subdivision exceeds such  tax,
      at  the  overpayment rate set by the commissioner of finance pursuant to
    
      section 11-687 of this chapter, or, if no rate is set, at  the  rate  of
      four  percent  per  annum from the date of payment of the amount so paid
      pursuant to such subdivision to the fifteenth day  of  the  third  month
      following  the close of the privilege period, provided, however, that no
      interest shall be allowed or paid under this subdivision if  the  amount
      thereof  is  less  than  one  dollar or if such interest becomes payable
      solely because of a carryback of a net operating loss  in  a  subsequent
      privilege period.
        6.  As  used in this section, "the preceding year's tax" means the tax
      imposed upon the taxpayer by section 11-603 of this subchapter  for  the
      preceding  calendar  or  fiscal  year, or, for purposes of computing the
      first installment of estimated tax when an application  has  been  filed
      for extension of the time for filing the report required to be filed for
      such  preceding  calendar  or fiscal year, the amount properly estimated
      pursuant to section 11-607 of this subchapter as the  tax  imposed  upon
      the taxpayer for such calendar or fiscal year.
        7.  This section shall apply to a privilege period of less than twelve
      months in accordance with regulations of the commissioner of finance.
        8. The provisions of this section shall apply to privilege periods  of
      twelve  months  other  than  a  calendar year by the substitution of the
      months of such fiscal year for the  corresponding  months  specified  in
      such provisions.
        9.  The  commissioner  of  finance may grant a reasonable extension of
      time, not to exceed six  months,  for  payment  of  any  installment  of
      estimated  tax  required  pursuant  to  this  section, on such terms and
      conditions as the commissioner may require including the furnishing of a
      bond or other security by the taxpayer in an amount not exceeding  twice
      the  amount  for  which  any  extension  of time for payment is granted,
      provided however that interest at  the  underpayment  rate  set  by  the
      commissioner  of finance pursuant to section 11-687 of this chapter, or,
      if no rate is set, at the rate of seven and one-half percent  per  annum
      for  the  period  of the extension shall be charged and collected on the
      amount for which any extension of time for payment is granted under this
      subdivision.
        10. A taxpayer may elect to pay any installment of estimated tax prior
      to the date prescribed in this section for payment thereof.
        11. The portion of an overpayment attributable to a  credit  allowable
      pursuant  to subdivision eleven of section 11-604 of this subchapter may
      not be credited against any payment due under this section.

        ยง  11-609 Collection of taxes. Every foreign corporation (other than a
      moneyed corporation) subject  to  the  provisions  of  this  subchapter,
      except  a  corporation  having  authority  to  do  business by virtue of
      section thirteen hundred five of the  business  corporation  law,  shall
      file  in  the  department  of  state a certificate of designation in its
      corporate  name,  signed  and  acknowledged  by  its  president   or   a
      vice-president  or its secretary or treasurer, under its corporate seal,
      designating the secretary of state as its agent upon whom process in any
      action provided for by this subchapter may be served within this  state,
      and  setting forth an address to which the secretary of state shall mail
      a copy of any such process against the corporation which may  be  served
      upon  the  secretary  of  state. In case any such corporation shall have
      failed to file such certificate of designation, it shall  be  deemed  to
      have  designated  the  secretary  of  state  as its agent upon whom such
      process against it may be served; and until a certificate of designation
      shall have been filed the corporation shall be deemed to  have  directed
      the  secretary of state to mail copies of process served upon him or her
      to the corporation at its last known office address  within  or  without
      the  state.  When  a  certificate  of designation has been filed by such
      corporation  the  secretary  of  state  shall  mail  copies  of  process
      thereafter  served  upon the secretary of state to the address set forth
      in such certificate. Any such corporation, from time to time, may change
      the address to which the secretary of state is directed to  mail  copies
      of  process, by filing a certificate to that effect executed, signed and
      acknowledged in like manner as a certificate of  designation  as  herein
      provided.  Service  of  process  upon  any  such corporation or upon any
      corporation having a certificate of authority under section two  hundred
      twelve of the general corporation law or having authority to do business
      by  virtue  of section thirteen hundred five of the business corporation
      law, in any action commenced at any time pursuant to the  provisions  of
      this subchapter, may be made by either: (a) personally delivering to and
      leaving with the secretary of state, a deputy secretary of state or with
      any  person authorized by the secretary of state to receive such service
      duplicate copies thereof at the office of the department of state in the
      city of Albany, in which event the secretary of  state  shall  forthwith
      send by registered mail, return receipt requested, one of such copies to
      the  corporation  at  the  address designated by it or at its last known
      office address within or without the state, or (b) personally delivering
      to and leaving with the secretary of state, a deputy secretary of  state
      or  with any person authorized by the secretary of state to receive such
      service, a copy thereof at the office of the department of state in  the
      city  of  Albany  and  by delivering a copy thereof to, and leaving such
      copy  with,  the   president,   vice-president,   secretary,   assistant
      secretary,   treasurer,   assistant   treasurer,   or  cashier  of  such
      corporation, or the officer  performing  corresponding  functions  under
      another  name,  or  a  director  or  managing agent of such corporation,
      personally without the state. Proof of such personal service without the
      state shall be filed with the clerk of the court in which the action  is
      pending within thirty days after such service, and such service shall be
      complete ten days after proof thereof is filed.

        ยง 11-610 Limitations of time. The provisions of the civil practice law
      and  rules  relative  to the limitation of time enforcing a civil remedy
      shall not apply to any proceeding or action  taken  to  levy,  appraise,
      assess,  determine  or  enforce  the  collection  of  any tax or penalty
      prescribed by this subchapter, provided, however, that as to real estate
      in the hands of persons who are owners thereof who would  be  purchasers
      in  good  faith  but  for such tax or penalty and as to the lien on real
      estate of mortgages held by persons who would be holders thereof in good
      faith but for such tax or penalty, all such taxes  and  penalties  shall
      cease  to  be  a  lien on such real estate as against such purchasers or
      holders after the expiration of ten  years  from  the  date  such  taxes
      became  due  and  payable. The limitations herein provided for shall not
      apply to any transfer from a corporation to a person or corporation with
      intent to avoid payment of any taxes, or  where  with  like  intent  the
      transfer  is  made  to  a grantee corporation, or any subsequent grantee
      corporation, controlled by such grantor or which has  any  community  of
      interest with it, either through stock ownership or otherwise.
