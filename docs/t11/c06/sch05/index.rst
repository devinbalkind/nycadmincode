Section 11-672 ::    
        
     
        ยง  11-672  Notice  of deficiency. 1. General. If upon examination of a
      taxpayer's return, the commissioner of finance determines that there  is
      a deficiency of tax, the commissioner may mail a notice of deficiency to
      the taxpayer. If a taxpayer fails to file a tax return, the commissioner
      of  finance  is authorized to estimate the taxpayer's city tax liability
      from any information in the commissioner's possession,  and  to  mail  a
      notice  of  deficiency  to the taxpayer. A notice of deficiency shall be
      mailed by certified or registered mail to  the  taxpayer,  at  its  last
      known  address in or out of the city. If the taxpayer has terminated its
      existence, a notice of deficiency  may  be  mailed  to  its  last  known
      address  in  or out of the city, and such notice shall be sufficient for
      purposes of this subchapter. If the commissioner of finance has received
      notice that a person is acting for the taxpayer in a fiduciary capacity,
      a copy of such notice shall also be mailed to  the  fiduciary  named  in
      such notice.
        2.  Notice  of  deficiency  as  assessment. After ninety days from the
      mailing of a notice of deficiency or, if the commissioner of finance has
      established a conciliation procedure pursuant to section 11-124  of  the
      code  and  the  taxpayer  has  requested  a  conciliation  conference in
      accordance  therewith,  after  ninety  days  from  the  mailing  of  the
      conciliation  decision or the date of the commissioner's confirmation of
      the discontinuance of the conciliation proceeding, such notice shall  be
      an  assessment of the amount of tax specified therein, together with the
      interest, additions to tax and penalties stated in such  notice,  except
      only  for  any  such  tax  or other amounts as to which the taxpayer has
      within such ninety day period filed with  the  tax  appeals  tribunal  a
      petition  under  section  11-680  of  this  subchapter. If the notice of
      deficiency or conciliation decision is addressed  to  a  taxpayer  whose
      last known address is outside of the United States, such period shall be
      one hundred fifty days instead of ninety days.
        3.  Restrictions on assessment and levy. No assessment of a deficiency
      in tax and no levy or proceeding in court for its  collection  shall  be
      made,  begun  or  prosecuted,  except  as  otherwise provided in section
      11-685 of this subchapter, until a notice of deficiency has been  mailed
      to  the  taxpayer,  nor  until  the  expiration of the time for filing a
      petition with the tax appeals tribunal contesting such notice, nor, if a
      petition with respect to the taxable year has been both  served  on  the
      commissioner  of  finance and filed with the tax appeals tribunal, until
      the decision of the tax appeals tribunal has become final. For exception
      in the case of judicial review  of  the  decision  of  the  tax  appeals
      tribunal, see subdivision three of section 11-681 of this subchapter.
        4. Exceptions for mathematical errors. If a mathematical error appears
      on  a return (including an overstatement of the amount paid as estimated
      tax), the commissioner of finance shall  notify  the  taxpayer  that  an
      amount  of  tax in excess of that shown upon the return is due, and that
      such excess has been assessed. Such notice shall not be considered as  a
      notice  of  deficiency for the purposes of this section, subdivision six
      of section 11-678 (limiting credits or refunds after petition to the tax
      appeals  tribunal),  or  subdivision  two  of  section  11-680  of  this
      subchapter  (authorizing  the  filing of a petition with the tax appeals
      tribunal based on a notice of deficiency), nor shall such assessment  or
      collection  be prohibited by the provisions of subdivision three of this
      section.
        5. Exception where federal or New York state change or  correction  is
      not reported.
        (a)  If  the  taxpayer fails to comply with subchapter two or three of
      this chapter in not reporting a change or correction  or  renegotiation,
      or  computation  or  recomputation  of tax, increasing or decreasing its
    
      federal or New York state taxable income,  alternative  minimum  taxable
      income  or  other  basis  of  tax as reported on its federal or New York
      state income tax return or in not reporting a change  or  correction  or
      renegotiation,  or computation or recomputation of tax, which is treated
      in the same manner as if it were a deficiency for federal  or  New  York
      state  income  tax purposes or in not filing an amended return or in not
      reporting the execution of a  notice  of  waiver  executed  pursuant  to
      subsection  (d)  of  section  six  thousand  two hundred thirteen of the
      internal revenue code or pursuant to  subdivision  (f)  of  section  one
      thousand  eighty-one  of  the  tax  law, instead of the mode and time of
      assessment  provided  for  in  subdivision  two  of  this  section,  the
      commissioner  of  finance  may  assess  a  deficiency  based  upon  such
      increased or  decreased  federal  or  New  York  state  taxable  income,
      alternative  minimum  taxable income or other basis of tax by mailing to
      the taxpayer a notice of additional tax due specifying the amount of the
      deficiency, and such deficiency, together with the  interest,  additions
      to  tax and penalties stated in such notice, shall be deemed assessed on
      the date such notice is mailed  unless  within  thirty  days  after  the
      mailing  of such notice a report of the federal or New York state change
      or correction or renegotiation, or computation or recomputation of  tax,
      or  an  amended return, where such return was required by subchapter two
      or three, is filed accompanied  by  a  statement  showing  wherein  such
      federal  or  New  York state determination and such notice of additional
      tax due are erroneous.
        (b) Such notice shall not be considered as a notice of deficiency  for
      the  purposes  of  this  section,  subdivision  six  of  section  11-678
      (limiting  credits  or  refunds  after  petition  to  the  tax   appeals
      tribunal),  or  subdivision  two  of  section  11-680 of this subchapter
      (authorizing the filing of a petition  with  the  tax  appeals  tribunal
      based  on  a  notice  of  deficiency),  nor shall such assessment or the
      collection thereof be prohibited by the provisions of subdivision  three
      of this section.
        (c)  If  the  taxpayer  has  terminated  its  existence,  a  notice of
      additional tax due may be mailed to the taxpayer's last known address in
      or out of the city, and such notice shall be sufficient for purposes  of
      this subchapter. If the commissioner of finance has received notice that
      a  person  is acting for the taxpayer in a fiduciary capacity, a copy of
      such notice shall also be mailed to the fiduciary named in such notice.
        6. Waiver of restrictions. The taxpayer shall at any time (whether  or
      not  a notice of deficiency has been issued) have the right to waive the
      restrictions on assessment and collection of the whole or  any  part  of
      the deficiency by a signed notice in writing filed with the commissioner
      of finance.
        7.  Two  or  more  corporations.  In  case  of a combined return under
      subchapter two or a consolidated return under subchapter three of two or
      more  corporations,  the  commissioner  of  finance  may   determine   a
      deficiency  of  tax  under  subchapter  two  or subchapter three of this
      chapter with respect to the entire tax due upon such return against  any
      taxpayer  included  therein.  In the case of a taxpayer which might have
      been included in such a return under subchapter two or subchapter  three
      of  this  chapter when the tax was originally reported, the commissioner
      of finance may determine a deficiency of tax  under  subchapter  two  or
      three  of  this  chapter  against  such  taxpayer  and against any other
      taxpayers which might have been included in such a return.
        8.  Deficiency  defined.  For  the  purposes  of  this  subchapter,  a
      deficiency means the amount of the tax imposed by the named subchapters,
      or  any  of  them,  less:  (a)  the  amount  shown  as  the tax upon the
      taxpayer's return (whether the return was made or the tax computed by it
    
      or by the commissioner of finance), and less (b) the amounts  previously
      assessed  (or collected without assessment) as a deficiency and plus (c)
      the amount of any rebates. For the purpose of this definition,  the  tax
      imposed  by subchapter two or three of this chapter and the tax shown on
      the return shall both be determined without regard  to  any  payment  of
      estimated  tax;  and  a  rebate  means  so much of an abatement, credit,
      refund or other repayment (whether or not erroneous) as was made on  the
      ground  that  the  amounts  entering into the definition of a deficiency
      showed a balance in favor of the taxpayer.
        9. Exception where change or correction of sales and compensating  use
      tax liability is not reported.
        (a)  If a taxpayer fails to comply with subchapter two of this chapter
      in not reporting a change or correction of its  sales  and  compensating
      use tax liability or in not filing a copy of an amended return or report
      relating to its sales and compensating use tax liability, instead of the
      mode  and  time  of  assessment  provided for in subdivision two of this
      section, the commissioner of finance may assess a deficiency based  upon
      such  changed  or corrected sales and compensating use tax liability, as
      same relates to credits claimed under subchapter two of this chapter, by
      mailing to the taxpayer a notice of additional tax  due  specifying  the
      amount  of  the  deficiency,  and  such  deficiency,  together  with the
      interest, additions to tax and penalties stated in such notice, shall be
      deemed assessed on the date such notice is mailed unless  within  thirty
      days  after  the  mailing of such notice a report of the state change or
      correction or a copy of an amended return or report, where such copy was
      required by subchapter two, is filed accompanied by a statement  showing
      wherein  such  state determination and such notice of additional tax due
      are erroneous.
        (b) Such notice shall not be considered as a notice of deficiency  for
      the  purposes  of  this  section,  subdivision  six  of  section  11-678
      (limiting  credits  or  refunds  after  petition  to  the  tax   appeals
      tribunal),  or subdivision two of section 11-680 (authorizing the filing
      of a petition with the  tax  appeals  tribunal  based  on  a  notice  of
      deficiency),  nor  shall  such  assessment  or the collection thereof be
      prohibited by the provisions of subdivision three of this section.
        (c) If  the  taxpayer  has  terminated  its  existence,  a  notice  of
      additional  tax due may be mailed to its last known address in or out of
      the city, and such notice shall  be  sufficient  for  purposes  of  this
      subchapter.  If  the  commissioner of finance has received notice that a
      person is acting for the taxpayer in a fiduciary  capacity,  a  copy  of
      such notice shall also be mailed to the fiduciary named in such notice.

Section 11-673 ::    
        
     
        ยง  11-673  Assessment.  1.  Assessment date. The amount of tax which a
      return shows to be due, or the amount of tax which a return  would  have
      shown  to  be  due  but  for a mathematical error, shall be deemed to be
      assessed on the date of filing of  the  return  (including  any  amended
      return  showing  an increase of tax). If a notice of deficiency has been
      mailed, the amount of the deficiency shall be deemed to be  assessed  on
      the  date  specified  in  subdivision  two  of  section  11-672  of this
      subchapter if no petition is both served on the commissioner of  finance
      and  filed  with the tax appeals tribunal, or if a petition is so served
      and filed, then upon the  date  when  a  decision  of  the  tax  appeals
      tribunal  establishing  the amount of the deficiency becomes final. If a
      report or an amended return filed pursuant to subchapter two or three of
      this chapter concedes the accuracy  of  a  federal  or  New  York  state
      adjustment  or  change  or correction or renegotiation or computation or
      recomputation of tax, any deficiency in  tax  under  subchapter  two  or
      three of this chapter resulting therefrom shall be deemed to be assessed
      on the date of filing such report or amended return, and such assessment
      shall be timely notwithstanding section 11-674 of this chapter.
        If  a report filed pursuant to subchapter two of this chapter concedes
      the accuracy of a state change or correction of sales  and  compensating
      use  tax  liability,  any deficiency in tax under subchapter two of this
      chapter resulting therefrom shall be deemed  assessed  on  the  date  of
      filing  such report, and such assessment shall be timely notwithstanding
      section 11-674 of this chapter.
        If a notice of additional tax due, as prescribed in  subdivision  five
      of  section  11-672  of this chapter, has been mailed, the amount of the
      deficiency shall be deemed to be assessed on the date specified in  such
      subdivision unless within thirty days after the mailing of such notice a
      report  of  the  federal  or  New  York  state  adjustment  or change or
      correction or renegotiation or computation or recomputation of  tax,  or
      an  amended  return, where such return was required by subchapter two or
      three of this chapter, is  filed  accompanied  by  a  statement  showing
      wherein  such federal or New York state determination and such notice of
      additional tax due are erroneous.
        If a notice of additional tax due, as prescribed in  subdivision  nine
      of section 11-672 of this subchapter, has been mailed, the amount of the
      deficiency  shall be deemed to be assessed on the date specified in such
      subdivision unless within thirty days after the mailing of such notice a
      report of the state change or correction, or a copy of an amended return
      or report, where such copy  was  required  by  subchapter  two  of  this
      chapter,  is filed accompanied by a statement showing wherein such state
      determination and such notice of additional tax due are erroneous.
        Any amount paid as a tax or in respect of a tax,  other  than  amounts
      paid  as  estimated tax, shall be deemed to be assessed upon the date of
      receipt of payment notwithstanding any other provisions.
        2. Other assessment powers. If the mode or time for the assessment  of
      any  tax  under  the named subchapters (including interest, additions to
      tax and  assessable  penalties)  is  not  otherwise  provided  for,  the
      commissioner of finance may establish the same by regulations.
        3.  Estimated  tax. No unpaid amount of estimated tax under subchapter
      two or three of this chapter shall be assessed.
        4. Supplemental assessment. The commissioner of finance  may,  at  any
      time  within  the  period  described for assessment, make a supplemental
      assessment,  subject  to  the  provisions  of  section  11-672  of  this
      subchapter  where  applicable,  whenever  it  is  ascertained  that  any
      assessment is imperfect or incomplete in any material respect.
        5. Cross reference. For assessment in case of  jeopardy,  see  section
      11-685 of this subchapter.

--------------

Section 11-674 ::    
        
     
        ยง  11-674  Limitations  on assessment. 1. General. Except as otherwise
      provided in this section, any tax under the named subchapters  shall  be
      assessed  within  three years after the return was filed (whether or not
      such return was filed on or after the date prescribed).
        2. Time return deemed filed. For  the  purposes  of  this  section,  a
      return  of  tax  filed  before  the  last  day  prescribed  by law or by
      regulations promulgated pursuant to law for the filing thereof shall  be
      deemed to be filed on such last day.
        3. Exceptions.
        (a) Assessment at any time. The tax may be assessed at any time if:
        (1) no return is filed,
        (2) a false or fraudulent return is filed with intent to evade tax,
        (3)  in  the  case of the tax imposed under subchapter two or three of
      this chapter, the taxpayer fails to file  a  report  or  amended  return
      required thereunder, in respect of an increase or decrease in federal or
      New  York  state  taxable  income, alternative minimum taxable income or
      other basis of tax or federal or New York state tax, or in respect of  a
      change  or correction or renegotiation or in respect of the execution of
      a  notice  of  waiver  report  of  which  is  required  thereunder,   or
      computation or recomputation of tax, which is treated in the same manner
      as  if  it  were  a  deficiency for federal or New York state income tax
      purposes, or
        (4) in the case of the  tax  imposed  under  subchapter  two  of  this
      chapter, the taxpayer fails to file a report or amended return or report
      required  thereunder,  in respect of a change or correction of sales and
      compensating use tax liability, relating to the purchase or use of items
      for which a sales or compensating use tax credit against the tax imposed
      by subchapter two was claimed.
        (b) Extension by agreement. Where, before the expiration of  the  time
      prescribed  in  this  section  for  the  assessment  of  tax,  both  the
      commissioner of finance and the taxpayer have consented  in  writing  to
      its  assessment  after  such  time,  the tax may be assessed at any time
      prior to the expiration of the period agreed upon. The period so  agreed
      upon may be extended by subsequent agreements in writing made before the
      expiration of the period previously agreed upon.
        (c)  Report  of federal or New York state change or correction. In the
      case of the tax imposed under subchapter two or three of  this  chapter,
      if the taxpayer files a report or amended return required thereunder, in
      respect  of an increase or decrease in federal or New York state taxable
      income, alternative minimum taxable income or  other  basis  of  tax  or
      federal  or  New York state tax, or in respect of a change or correction
      or renegotiation, or in respect of the execution of a notice  of  waiver
      report  of which is required thereunder, or computation or recomputation
      of tax, which is treated in the same manner as if it were  a  deficiency
      for  federal  or  New York state income tax purposes, the assessment (if
      not deemed to have been made upon the filing of the  report  or  amended
      return)  may  be  made at any time within two years after such report or
      amended return was filed. The amount of such assessment of tax shall not
      exceed the amount of the increase  in  city  tax  attributable  to  such
      federal  or  New  York  state  change or correction or renegotiation, or
      computation or recomputation of tax. The provisions  of  this  paragraph
      shall  not  affect  the  time  within  which  or the amount for which an
      assessment may otherwise be made.
        (d) Deficiency attributable to carry back.  If  a  deficiency  of  tax
      under  subchapter two of this chapter is attributable to the application
      to taxpayer of a net operating loss carry back or a capital  loss  carry
      back,  it  may be assessed at any time that a deficiency for the taxable
      year of the loss may be assessed.
    
        (e) Recovery  of  erroneous  refund.  An  erroneous  refund  shall  be
      considered an underpayment of tax on the date made, and an assessment of
      a  deficiency arising out of an erroneous refund may be made at any time
      within two years  from  the  making  of  the  refund,  except  that  the
      assessment  may  be made within five years from the making of the refund
      if it appears that any part of  the  refund  was  induced  by  fraud  or
      misrepresentation of a material fact.
        (f)  Request  for  prompt assessment. The tax shall be assessed within
      eighteen months after written request therefor (made after the return is
      filed) by the taxpayer or by a fiduciary representing the taxpayer,  but
      not  more  than  three  years  after  the  return  was  filed, except as
      otherwise provided  in  this  subdivision  and  subdivision  four.  This
      subdivision shall not apply unless:
        (1) (A) such written request notifies the commissioner of finance that
      the  taxpayer  contemplates  dissolution  at or before the expiration of
      such eighteen-month period, (B) the dissolution is in good  faith  begun
      before the expiration of such eighteen-month period, (C) the dissolution
      is completed;
        (2) (A) such written request notifies the commissioner of finance that
      a  dissolution  has in good faith been begun, and (B) the dissolution is
      completed; or
        (3) a dissolution has been completed at the time such written  request
      is made.
        (g)  Change  of  the  allocation  of  taxpayer's income or capital. No
      change of the allocation of income or capital upon which the  taxpayer's
      return  (or  any additional assessment) was based shall be made where an
      assessment of tax is made during the  additional  period  of  limitation
      under  subparagraph  three  or four of paragraph (a), or under paragraph
      (c), (d) or (i); and where any such assessment has been made, or where a
      notice of deficiency has been mailed to the taxpayer on the basis of any
      such proposed assessment, no change  of  the  allocation  of  income  or
      capital shall be made in a proceeding on the taxpayer's claim for refund
      of  such assessment or on the taxpayer's petition for redetermination of
      such deficiency.
        (h)  Report   concerning   waste   treatment   facility.   Under   the
      circumstances  described  in  subparagraph  three  of  paragraph  (g) of
      subdivision eight of section 11-602 of this  chapter,  the  tax  may  be
      assessed  within  three  years after the filing of the report containing
      the information required by such paragraph.
        (i) Report of changed or corrected  sales  and  compensating  use  tax
      liability.  In  the  case  of a tax imposed under subchapter two of this
      chapter, if the taxpayer files a report  or  amended  return  or  report
      required  thereunder,  in respect of a change or correction of sales and
      compensating use tax liability, the assessment (if not  deemed  to  have
      been  made upon the filing of the report) may be made at any time within
      two years after such report or amended return or report was  filed.  The
      amount  of  such  assessment  of  tax shall not exceed the amount of the
      increase in city tax attributable to such state  change  or  correction.
      The  provisions of this paragraph shall not affect the time within which
      or the amount for which an assessment may otherwise be made.
        4. Omission of income on return. The tax may be assessed at  any  time
      within  six  years  after  the return was filed if a taxpayer omits from
      gross income required to be reported on a return under any of the  named
      subchapters  an amount properly includable therein which is in excess of
      twenty-five per centum of the amount  of  gross  income  stated  in  the
      return.
        For the purposes of this subdivision:
    
        (a)  the term "gross income" means gross income for federal income tax
      purposes as reportable on a return under subchapter two of this  chapter
      and  "gross  earnings",  "gross  income,"  "gross  operating income" and
      "gross direct premiums less return premiums," as those terms are used in
      whichever of the named subchapters is applicable;
        (b)  there shall not be taken into account any amount which is omitted
      in the return if such amount  is  disclosed  in  the  return,  or  in  a
      statement  attached  to  the return, in a manner adequate to apprise the
      commissioner of finance of the nature and amount of such item.
        5. Suspension of running of period of limitations. The running of  the
      period of limitations on assessment or collection of tax or other amount
      (or  of a tranferee's liability) shall, after the mailing of a notice of
      deficiency, be suspended for the period during which the commissioner of
      finance is prohibited under subdivision three of section 11-672 of  this
      subchapter from making the assessment or from collecting by levy.

Section 11-675 ::    
        
     
        ยง 11-675 Interest on underpayment. 1. General. If any amount of tax is
      not paid on or before the last date prescribed in whichever of the named
      subchapters  is  applicable  for payment, interest on such amount at the
      underpayment rate set by the commissioner of finance pursuant to section
      11-687 of this subchapter, or, if no rate is set, at the rate  of  seven
      and  one-half  percent  per annum shall be paid for the period from such
      last date to the date paid, whether or not any  extension  of  time  for
      payment  was  granted. Interest under this subdivision shall not be paid
      if the amount thereof is less than one dollar.
        2. Exception as to estimated tax. This section shall not apply to  any
      failure to pay estimated tax under subchapter two or subchapter three of
      this chapter.
        3.  Exception  for mathematical error. No interest shall be imposed on
      any underpayment of tax due solely to mathematical error if the taxpayer
      files a return within the time prescribed  in  whichever  of  the  named
      subchapters is applicable (including any extension of time) and pays the
      amount  of  underpayment  within three months after the due date of such
      return, as it may be extended.
        4. Suspension of interest on deficiencies. If a waiver of restrictions
      on assessment of a deficiency has been filed by  the  taxpayer,  and  if
      notice  and  demand  by  the commissioner of finance for payment of such
      deficiency is not made within thirty  days  after  the  filing  of  such
      waiver,  interest shall not be imposed on such deficiency for the period
      beginning immediately after such thirtieth day and ending with the  date
      of notice and demand.
        5.  Tax  reduced  by carry back. If the amount of tax under subchapter
      two for any taxable year is reduced by reason of a carryback  of  a  net
      operating loss or a capital loss, such reduction in tax shall not affect
      the  computation  of  interest  under this section for the period ending
      with the filing date for the taxable year in  which  the  net  operating
      loss  or  capital  loss  arises.  Such  filing  date shall be determined
      without regard to extensions of time to file.
        6. Interest treated as tax. Interest under this section shall be  paid
      upon  notice and demand and shall be assessed, collected and paid in the
      same manner as the taxes under the named subchapters. Any  reference  in
      this  subchapter  to the tax imposed by the named subchapters, or any of
      them, shall be deemed also to refer to interest imposed by this  section
      on such tax.
        7. Interest on penalties or addition to tax. Interest shall be imposed
      under  subdivision  one in respect to any assessable penalty or addition
      to tax only if such assessable penalty or addition to tax  is  not  paid
      within  ten  days  from the date of the notice and demand therefor under
      subdivision two of section  11-683  of  this  subchapter  in  such  case
      interest  shall  be  imposed  only  for the period from such date of the
      notice and demand to the date of payment.
        8. Payment within ten days after notice  and  demand.  If  notice  and
      demand  is  made  for  payment  of  any  amount under subdivision two of
      section 11-683 of this subchapter, and if such amount is paid within ten
      days after the date of such  notice  and  demand,  interest  under  this
      section  on the amount so paid shall not be imposed for the period after
      the date of such notice and demand.
        9. Limitation on assessment and collection. Interest prescribed  under
      this section may be assessed and collected at any time during the period
      within  which the tax or other amount to which such interest relates may
      be assessed and collected respectively.
        10. Interest on erroneous refund. Any portion of tax or  other  amount
      which  has  been  erroneously  refunded, and which is recoverable by the
      commissioner of finance, shall bear interest at  the  underpayment  rate
    
      set  by  the  commissioner of finance pursuant to section 11-687 of this
      subchapter, or, if no rate is set, at the rate  of  seven  and  one-half
      percent  per  annum from the date of the payment of the refund, but only
      if  it  appears  that  any  part of the refund was induced by fraud or a
      misrepresentation of a material fact.
        11. Satisfaction by credits. If any portion of a tax is  satisfied  by
      credit  of  an overpayment, then no interest shall be imposed under this
      section on the portion of the tax so satisfied  for  any  period  during
      which,  if  the  credit  had  not  been  made,  interest would have been
      allowable with respect to such overpayment.

        ยง  11-676  Additions  to  tax and civil penalties. 1. * (a) Failure to
      file return. (A) In case of failure to file a  return  under  the  named
      subchapters  on or before the prescribed date (determined with regard to
      any extension of time for filing), unless it is shown that such  failure
      is  due  to reasonable cause and not due to willful neglect, there shall
      be added to the amount required to be shown as tax on such  return  five
      percent  of  the  amount of such tax if the failure is for not more than
      one month, with an additional five percent for each additional month  or
      fraction  thereof  during  which  such  failure continues, not exceeding
      twenty-five percent in the aggregate.
        (B) In the case of a failure to file a return of tax within sixty days
      of the date prescribed for filing of such return (determined with regard
      to any extension of time for filing),  unless  it  is  shown  that  such
      failure  is  due to reasonable cause and not due to willful neglect, the
      addition to tax under subparagraph (A) of this paragraph  shall  not  be
      less  than  the  lesser of one hundred dollars or one hundred percent of
      the amount required to be shown as tax on such return.
        (C) For purposes of this paragraph, the amount of tax required  to  be
      shown  on  the  return shall be reduced by the amount of any part of the
      tax which is paid on or before the date prescribed for  payment  of  the
      tax and by the amount of any credit against the tax which may be claimed
      upon the return.
        * NB Amended Ch. 765/85 ยง 62, language juxtaposed per Ch. 907/85 ยง 14
        (b)  Failure to pay tax shown on return. In case of failure to pay the
      amounts shown as tax on any return required to be filed under the  named
      subchapters  on or before the prescribed date (determined with regard to
      any extension of time for payment), unless it is shown that such failure
      is due to reasonable cause and not due to willful neglect,  there  shall
      be  added  to  the  amount  shown  as tax on such return one-half of one
      percent of the amount of such tax if the failure is not  for  more  than
      one  month,  with  an  additional  one-half  of  one  percent  for  each
      additional  month  or  fraction  thereof  during  which   such   failure
      continues,  not  exceeding twenty-five percent in the aggregate. For the
      purpose of computing the addition for any month the amount of tax  shown
      on  the  return  shall  be  reduced by the amount of any part of the tax
      which is paid on or before the beginning of such month and by the amount
      of any credit against the tax which may be claimed upon the  return.  If
      the  amount  of  tax  required  to be shown on a return is less than the
      amount shown as tax on such return, this paragraph shall be  applied  by
      substituting such lower amount.
        (c)  Failure  to  pay  tax  required to be shown on return. In case of
      failure to pay any amount in respect of any tax required to be shown  on
      a  return  required to be filed under the named subchapters which is not
      so shown (including an assessment made pursuant to  subdivision  one  of
      section  11-673  of  this  subchapter)  within ten days of the date of a
      notice and demand therefor, unless it is shown that such failure is  due
      to reasonable cause and not due to willful neglect, there shall be added
      to  the  amount  of tax stated in such notice and demand one-half of one
      percent of such tax if the failure is not for more than one month,  with
      an  additional  one-half  of  one  percent  for each additional month or
      fraction thereof during which  such  failure  continues,  not  exceeding
      twenty-five  percent  in the aggregate. For the purpose of computing the
      addition for any month, the amount of  tax  stated  in  the  notice  and
      demand  shall  be  reduced by the amount of any part of the tax which is
      paid before the beginning of such month.
        * (d) Limitations on additions. (A) With respect to  any  return,  the
      amount  of the addition under paragraph (a) of this subdivision shall be
      reduced by the amount of  the  addition  under  paragraph  (b)  of  this
    
      subdivision  for  any  month  to  which  an  addition applies under both
      paragraphs (a) and (b). In any case described  in  subparagraph  (B)  of
      paragraph (a) of this subdivision, the amount of the addition under such
      paragraph  (a)  shall  not  be reduced below the amount provided in such
      subparagraph.
        (B) With respect to any return, the maximum  amount  of  the  addition
      permitted  under  paragraph  (c) of this subdivision shall be reduced by
      the amount of the addition  under  paragraph  (a)  of  this  subdivision
      (determined  without  regard  to subparagraph (B) of such paragraph (a))
      which is attributable to the tax for which the notice and demand is made
      and which is not paid within ten days of such notice and demand.

        * 2. Deficiency due to negligence. (a) If any part of a deficiency  is
      due  to negligence or intentional disregard of this subchapter or any of
      the named subchapters or rules or regulations  thereunder  (but  without
      intent  to  defraud), there shall be added to the tax an amount equal to
      five percent of the deficiency.
        (b) There shall be added  to  the  tax  (in  addition  to  the  amount
      determined  under  paragraph (a) of this subdivision) an amount equal to
      fifty percent of the interest payable under subdivision one  of  section
      11-675  with  respect to the portion of the deficiency described in such
      paragraph (a) which is attributable to  the  negligence  or  intentional
      disregard referred to in such paragraph (a), for the period beginning on
      the  last  date  prescribed  by  law  for  payment  of  such  deficiency
      (determined without regard to any extension) and ending on the  date  of
      the  assessment  of  the tax (or, if earlier, the date of the payment of
      the tax).
        (c) If any payment is shown on a return made by a payor  with  respect
      to  dividends,  patronage dividends and interest under subsection (a) of
      section six thousand forty-two, subsection (a) of section  six  thousand
      forty-four  or  subsection (a) of section six thousand forty-nine of the
      internal revenue code of nineteen hundred fifty-four, respectively,  and
      the  payee fails to include any portion of such payment in gross income,
      as that term is defined in paragraph (a) of subdivision four of  section
      11-674,  any  portion  of  an  underpayment attributable to such failure
      shall be treated, for purposes of this subdivision, as due to negligence
      in the absence of clear and convincing evidence to the contrary. If  any
      addition  to  tax  is  imposed  under  this subdivision by reason of the
      preceding sentence, the  amount  of  the  addition  to  tax  imposed  by
      paragraph  (a)  of this subdivision shall be five percent of the portion
      of the underpayment which is attributable to the  failure  described  in
      the preceding sentence.

        3.  Failure  to  file declaration or underpayment of estimated tax. If
      any taxpayer  fails  to  file  a  declaration  of  estimated  tax  under
      subchapter two or three of this chapter, or fails to pay all or any part
      of  an  amount which is applied as an installment against such estimated
      tax, it shall be deemed to have made an underpayment of  estimated  tax.
      There  shall  be  added to the tax for the taxable year an amount at the
      underpayment rate set by the commissioner of finance pursuant to section
      11-687 of this subchapter, or, if no rate is set, at the rate  of  seven
      and  one-half  percent per annum upon the amount of the underpayment for
      the period of the underpayment but not beyond the fifteenth day  of  the
      third  month  following the close of the taxable year. The amount of the
      underpayment shall be, with respect to any installment of estimated  tax
      computed  on  the  basis  of the preceding year's tax, the excess of the
      amount required to be paid over the amount, if any, paid  on  or  before
      the  last  day prescribed for such payment or, with respect to any other
    
      installment  of  estimated  tax,  the  excess  of  the  amount  of   the
      installment which would be required to be paid if the estimated tax were
      equal  to  ninety percent of the tax shown on the return for the taxable
      year  (or  if  no  return  was filed, ninety percent of the tax for such
      year) over the amount, if any, of the installment paid on or before  the
      last  day  prescribed for such payment. In any case in which there would
      be no underpayment if "eighty  percent"  were  substituted  for  "ninety
      percent"  each place it appears in this subdivision, the addition to the
      tax shall be equal to  seventy-five  percent  of  the  amount  otherwise
      determined.  No  underpayment shall be deemed to exist with respect to a
      declaration or installment otherwise due on or after the termination  of
      existence of the taxpayer.
        4.  Exception  to  addition  for  underpayment  of  estimated tax. The
      addition to tax under subdivision three with respect to any underpayment
      of any amount which is applied as an installment against  estimated  tax
      under  subchapter  two  or three of this chapter shall not be imposed if
      the total amount of all payments of estimated tax made on or before  the
      last  date  prescribed  for  the  payment  of  any such amount equals or
      exceeds the amount which would have been  required  to  be  paid  on  or
      before such date if the estimated tax were whichever of the following is
      the least:
        (a)  The  tax  shown  on  the return of the taxpayer for the preceding
      taxable year, if a return showing a liability for tax was filed  by  the
      taxpayer  for  the  preceding taxable year and such preceding year was a
      taxable year of twelve months, or
        (b) An amount equal to the tax computed at the rates applicable to the
      taxable year, but otherwise on the basis  of  the  facts  shown  on  the
      return  of  the  taxpayer  for, and the law applicable to, the preceding
      taxable year, or
        (c) (i) An amount equal to ninety  per  centum  of  the  tax  for  the
      taxable  year  computed  by  placing  on an annualized basis the taxable
      income:
        (1) for the first three months or the first five months of the taxable
      year, in the case of the installment required to be paid  in  the  sixth
      month,
        (2)  for the first six months or the first eight months of the taxable
      year, in the case of the installment required to be paid  in  the  ninth
      month, and
        (3)  for  the  first  nine  months  or  the first eleven months of the
      taxable year, in the case of the installment required to be paid in  the
      twelfth month.
        (ii)  For  purposes  of  subparagraph  (i) the taxable income shall be
      placed on an annualized basis by:
        (1) multiplying it by twelve (or, in the case of  a  taxable  year  of
      less than twelve months, the number of months in the taxable year) and
        (2)  dividing  the  resulting  amount  by  the number of months in the
      taxable year (three, five, six, eight, nine or eleven, as the  case  may
      be) referred to in subparagraph (i), or
        (d)  (i)  If the base period percentage for any six consecutive months
      of the taxable year equals or exceeds seventy percent, an  amount  equal
      to ninety percent of the tax determined in the following manner:
        (A)  take  the  taxable  income for all months during the taxable year
      preceding the filing month,
        (B) divide such amount by the base period percentage  for  all  months
      during the taxable year preceding the filing month,
        (C) determine the tax on the amount determined under clause (B), and
    
        (D)  multiply  the  tax determined under clause (C) by the base period
      percentage for the filing month and all months during the  taxable  year
      preceding the filing month.
        (ii) For purposes of subparagraph (i):
        (A)  the  base period percentage for any period of months shall be the
      average percent which the taxable income for the corresponding months in
      each of the three preceding taxable years bears to  the  taxable  income
      for  the  three preceding taxable years. The commissioner of finance may
      by  regulations  provide  for  the  determination  of  the  base  period
      percentage  in  the case of reorganizations, new corporations, and other
      similar circumstances, and
        (B) the term "filing month" means the month in which  the  installment
      is required to be paid.
        5.  (a) Except as provided in paragraph (b) hereof, paragraphs (a) and
      (b) of subdivision four of this section shall not apply in the  case  of
      any  corporation  (or  any predecessor corporation) which had entire net
      income, or the portion thereof allocated within the city, of one million
      dollars or more for any taxable year  during  the  three  taxable  years
      immediately preceding the taxable year involved.
        (b)  The  amount treated as the estimated tax under paragraphs (a) and
      (b) of subdivision four of this section shall in no event be  less  than
      seventy-five percent of the tax shown on the return for the taxable year
      beginning  in  nineteen hundred eighty-three or, if no return was filed,
      seventy-five percent of the tax for such year.
        6. Deficiency due to fraud. (a) If any part of a deficiency is due  to
      fraud,  there shall be added to the tax an amount equal to two times the
      deficiency.
        (c) The addition to tax under this subdivision shall be in lieu of any
      other addition to tax imposed by subdivision one or two.
        7. Additional penalty. Any person who  with  fraudulent  intent  shall
      fail  to  pay  under  the named subchapters any tax, or to make, render,
      sign or certify any return or declaration of estimated tax, or to supply
      any information within the time required by or under any  of  the  named
      subchapters,  shall  be  liable to penalty of not more than one thousand
      dollars, in addition to any other amounts required under this subchapter
      to be imposed, assessed and collected by the  commissioner  of  finance.
      The  commissioner  of  finance  shall  have  the  power,  in  his or her
      discretion, to waive,  reduce  or  compromise  any  penalty  under  this
      subdivision.
        * 8.  Additions  treated  as  tax.  The additions to tax and penalties
      provided by this section shall be paid upon notice and demand and  shall
      be  assessed,  collected  and  paid in the same manner as taxes, and any
      reference in this  subchapter  to  tax  imposed  by  any  of  the  named
      subchapters  shall  be  deemed also to refer to the additions to tax and
      penalties provided by this section. For purposes of  section  11-672  of
      this subchapter, this subdivision shall not apply to:
        (a)  any  addition  to  tax  under  subdivision  one except as to that
      portion attributable to a deficiency;
        (b) any addition to tax under subdivision three or fourteen; and
        (c) any additional penalties under subdivisions seven and twelve.

        9. Determination of deficiency. For purposes of subdivisions  two  and
      six the amount shown as the tax by the taxpayer upon its return shall be
      taken  into  account in determining the amount of the deficiency only if
      such return was filed on or before  the  last  day  prescribed  for  the
      filing  of  such return, determined with regard to any extension of time
      for such filing.
    
        * 10. Person defined. For purposes of subdivisions seven  and  twelve,
      the  term "person" includes an individual, corporation or partnership or
      an officer  or  employee  of  any  corporation  (including  a  dissolved
      corporation),  or  a  member or employee of any partnership, who as such
      officer,  employee,  or  member  is  under  a duty to perform the act in
      respect of which the violation occurs.

        * 11.  Substantial  understatement  of  liability.  If  there   is   a
      substantial  understatement  of tax for any taxable year, there shall be
      added to the tax an amount equal to ten percent of  the  amount  of  any
      underpayment  attributable  to such understatement. For purposes of this
      subdivision, there is  a  substantial  understatement  of  tax  for  any
      taxable  year  if  the amount of the understatement for the taxable year
      exceeds the greater of ten percent of the tax required to  be  shown  on
      the  return  for the taxable year or five thousand dollars. For purposes
      of the preceding sentence, the term "understatement" means the excess of
      the amount of the tax required to be shown on the return for the taxable
      year, over the amount of the tax imposed which is shown on  the  return,
      reduced  by  any  rebate  (within  the  meaning  of subdivision eight of
      section 11-672).  The amount of such understatement shall be reduced  by
      that  portion  of  the  understatement  which is attributable to the tax
      treatment of any item by the taxpayer if there  is  or  was  substantial
      authority  for  such  treatment,  or  any item with respect to which the
      relevant  facts  affecting  the  item's  tax  treatment  are  adequately
      disclosed  in  the  return or in a statement attached to the return. The
      commissioner of finance may waive all or any part of the addition to tax
      provided by this subdivision on a showing by the taxpayer that there was
      reasonable cause for the understatement (or part thereof) and  that  the
      taxpayer acted in good faith.

      receives  compensation, aid or assist in, or procure, counsel, or advise
      the preparation or presentation under, or in connection with any  matter
      arising under this chapter of any return, report, declaration, statement
      or  other  document  which  is  fraudulent  or  false as to any material
      matter, or supply any false or fraudulent information,  whether  or  not
      such  falsity  or  fraud  is with the knowledge or consent of the person

      an act, and knowing of, and not attempting to prevent, participation  by
      a  subordinate  in an act. The term "subordinate" means any other person
      (whether or not a director, officer, employee, or agent of the  taxpayer
      involved)  over  whose activities the person has direction, supervision,
      or control.
        (c) For purposes of  paragraph  (a)  of  this  subdivision,  a  person
      furnishing  typing,  reproducing,  or  other  mechanical assistance with

      payments. In case of failure to file the report of information  required
      under  subdivision two-a of section 11-605 of this chapter, unless it is
      shown that such failure is due  to  reasonable  cause  and  not  due  to
      willful  neglect,  there  shall  be  added  to the tax a penalty of five
      hundred dollars.
        14. Failure to include on  return  information  relating  to  issuer's
      allocation  percentage. Where a return is filed but does not contain (1)
      the information necessary to compute the taxpayer's issuer's  allocation
      percentage,   as  defined  in  subparagraph  one  of  paragraph  (b)  of
      subdivision three of section 11-604 of this chapter, where the  same  is
      called  for  on  the  return, or, (2) the taxpayer's issuer's allocation
      percentage, where the same is called for on the return but where all  of
      the  information necessary for the computation of such percentage is not
      called for on the return, then unless it is shown that such  failure  is
      due  to  reasonable  cause and not due to willful neglect there shall be

Section 11-677 ::    
        
     
        ยง  11-677 Overpayment. 1. General. The commissioner of finance, within
      the applicable period of limitations, may credit an overpayment  of  tax
      and interest on such overpayment against any liability in respect of any
      tax  imposed  by  any of the named subchapters of this chapter or on the
      taxpayer who made the overpayment, and the balance shall be refunded out
      of the proceeds of the tax.
        2. Credits against estimated tax.  The  commissioner  of  finance  may
      prescribe  regulations providing for the crediting against the estimated
      tax under subchapter two or three of this chapter for any  taxable  year
      of  the  amount  determined  to  be an overpayment of tax under any such
      subchapter for a preceding taxable year. If any overpayment of tax is so
      claimed as a credit against estimated tax  for  the  succeeding  taxable
      year,  such  amount  shall  be  considered as a payment of the tax under
      subchapter two or three of this chapter for the succeeding taxable  year
      (whether  or not claimed as a credit in the declaration of estimated tax
      for such succeeding taxable year), and no claim for credit or refund  of
      such  overpayment  shall  be  allowed for the taxable year for which the
      overpayment arises.
        3. Rule where no tax liability. If there is no  tax  liability  for  a
      period  in  respect of which an amount is paid as tax, such amount shall
      be considered an overpayment.
        4. Assessment and collection after limitation period. If any amount of
      tax is assessed or collected after  the  expiration  of  the  period  of
      limitations properly applicable thereto, such amount shall be considered
      an overpayment.
        5. Assignment of overpayment. A credit for an overpayment of tax under
      any  of  the  named  subchapters  may  be  assigned by the taxpayer to a
      corporation liable to pay taxes under any of the named subchapters,  and
      the  assignee  of  the  whole or any part of such credit, on filing such
      assignment with the commissioner of finance, shall thereupon be entitled
      to credit upon the books of the commissioner of finance for  the  amount
      thereof  on its current account for taxes, in the same manner and to the
      same effect as though the credit had  originally  been  allowed  in  its
      favor.
        6.  Notwithstanding  article  fifty-two  of the civil practice law and
      rules or any other provision of law to the contrary, the procedures  for
      the  enforcement of money judgments shall not apply to the department of
      finance, or to  any  officer  or  employee  of  such  department,  as  a
      garnishee,  with  respect  to  any  amount  of  money  to be refunded or
      credited to a taxpayer under this chapter.

--------------

Section 11-678 ::    
        
     
        ยง 11-678 Limitations on credit or refund. 1. General. Claim for credit
      or  refund  of  an overpayment of tax under any of the named subchapters
      shall be filed by the taxpayer within three  years  from  the  time  the
      return  was filed or two years from the time the tax was paid, whichever
      of such periods expires the later, or if no return was filed within  two
      years  from  the time the tax was paid. If the claim is filed within the
      three year period, the amount of the credit or refund shall  not  exceed
      the portion of the tax paid within the three years immediately preceding
      the  filing  of  the  claim plus the period of any extension of time for
      filing the return. If the claim is  not  filed  within  the  three  year
      period,  but  is  filed  within  the  two year period, the amount of the
      credit or refund shall not exceed the portion of the tax paid during the
      two years immediately preceding the  filing  of  the  claim.  Except  as
      otherwise  provided in this section, if no claim is filed, the amount of
      a credit or refund shall not exceed the amount which would be  allowable
      if  a  claim had been filed on the date the credit or refund is allowed.
      For special restriction in a proceeding on a claim  for  refund  of  tax
      paid  pursuant to an assessment made as a result of: (a) a net operating
      loss carryback, or (b) an increase or decrease in federal  or  New  York
      state  taxable income or other basis of tax or federal or New York state
      tax, or (c) a  federal  or  New  York  state  change  or  correction  or
      renegotiation,  or computation or recomputation of tax, which is treated
      in the same manner as if it were a deficiency for federal  or  New  York
      state  income  tax  purposes,  see paragraph (g) of subdivision three of
      section 11-674 of this subchapter.
        2. Extension  of  time  by  agreement.  If  any  agreement  under  the
      provisions  of  paragraph  (b) of subdivision three of section 11-674 of
      this subchapter (extending the period of  assessment  of  tax)  is  made
      within  the  period  prescribed  in  subdivision one for the filing of a
      claim for credit or refund, the period for filing a claim for credit  or
      refund,  or  for making credit or refund if no claim is filed, shall not
      expire prior to six months after the expiration  of  the  period  within
      which  an  assessment  may  be  made  pursuant  to  the agreement or any
      extension thereof. The amount of such credit or refund shall not  exceed
      the  portion  of  the  tax paid after the execution of the agreement and
      before the filing of the claim or the making of the credit or refund, as
      the case may be, plus the portion of the  tax  paid  within  the  period
      which  would  be  applicable  under  subdivision one if a claim had been
      filed on the date the agreement was executed.
        3. Notice of change or correction of federal or New York state  income
      or  other  basis  of tax. If a taxpayer is required by subchapter two or
      three of this chapter to file a report or amended return in  respect  of
      (a)  a decrease or increase in federal or New York state taxable income,
      alternative minimum taxable income or other basis of tax or  federal  or
      New York state tax, (b) a federal or New York state change or correction
      or  renegotiation,  or  computation  or  recomputation  of tax, which is
      treated in the same manner as if it were an overpayment for  federal  or
      New  York  state  income tax purposes, claim for credit or refund of any
      resulting overpayment of tax shall be filed by the taxpayer  within  two
      years  from  the  time  such report or amended return was required to be
      filed with the commissioner of finance. If the report or amended  return
      required  by subchapter two or three of this chapter is not filed within
      the ninety day period therein specified, no interest shall be payable on
      any claim for credit or refund of the overpayment  attributable  to  the
      federal  or  New  York  state  change  or correction. The amount of such
      credit or refund:
    
        (c) shall be computed without change of the allocation  of  income  or
      capital  upon which the taxpayer's return (or any additional assessment)
      was based, and
        (d)  shall  not exceed the amount of the reduction in tax attributable
      to such decrease or increase  in  federal  or  New  York  state  taxable
      income,  alternative  minimum  taxable  income  or other basis of tax or
      federal or New York state tax or to  such  federal  or  New  York  state
      change  or  correction or renegotiation, or computation or recomputation
      of tax.
        This subdivision shall not affect the time within which or the  amount
      for  which  a  claim  for  credit or refund may be filed apart from this
      subdivision.
        4. Overpayment attributable  to  net  operating  loss  carry  back  or
      capital  loss  carry back. A claim for credit or refund of so much of an
      overpayment under subchapter two of this chapter as is  attributable  to
      the  application to the taxpayer of a net operating loss carry back or a
      capital loss carry back shall be filed within three years from the  time
      the  return  was due (including extensions thereof) for the taxable year
      of the loss, or within the  period  prescribed  in  subdivision  two  in
      respect  of  such  taxable  year,  or  within  the  period prescribed in
      subdivision three, where applicable, in respect to the taxable  year  to
      which  the net operating loss or capital loss is carried back, whichever
      expires the latest. Where such claim for credit or refund is filed after
      the expiration of  the  period  prescribed  in  subdivision  one  or  in
      subdivision  two  where  applicable,  in  respect to the taxable year to
      which the net operating loss or capital loss is carried back, the amount
      of such credit or  refund  shall  be  computed  without  change  of  the
      allocation of income or capital upon which the taxpayer's return (or any
      additional assessment) was based.
        5. Failure to file claim within prescribed period. No credit or refund
      shall  be allowed or made, except as provided in subdivision six of this
      section or subdivision four of section 11-681 of this subchapter,  after
      the  expiration of the applicable period of limitation specified in this
      subchapter, unless a claim for credit or refund is filed by the taxpayer
      within such period. Any later credit shall be void and any later  refund
      erroneous.  No  period  of  limitations specified in any other law shall
      apply to the recovery by a taxpayer of moneys paid in respect  of  taxes
      under the named subchapters.
        6.  Effect  of  a  petition  to  tax  appeals tribunal. If a notice of
      deficiency for a taxable year has been  mailed  to  the  taxpayer  under
      section  11-672  of  this  subchapter and if the taxpayer files a timely
      petition with the tax appeals tribunal  under  section  11-680  of  this
      subchapter, the tax appeals tribunal may determine that the taxpayer has
      made  an  overpayment for such year (whether or not it also determines a
      deficiency for such year). No separate claim for credit  or  refund  for
      such year shall be filed, and no credit or refund for such year shall be
      allowed or made, except:
        (a)  as  to  overpayment  determined  by a decision of the tax appeals
      tribunal which has become final; and
        (b) as to any amount collected in excess  of  an  amount  computed  in
      accordance  with  the  decision  of  the  tax appeals tribunal which has
      become final; and
        (c) as to any amount collected after the period of limitation upon the
      making of levy for collection has expired; and
        (d) as to any amount claimed as a result of  a  change  or  correction
      described in subdivision three.
        7.  Limit  on  amount  of  credit or refund. The amount of overpayment
      determined under subdivision six shall, when the  decision  of  the  tax
    
      appeals tribunal has become final, be credited or refunded in accordance
      with  subdivision one of section 11-677 of this subchapter and shall not
      exceed the amount of tax which the tax appeals  tribunal  determines  as
      part of its decision was paid:
        (a) after the mailing of the notice of deficiency, or
        (b) within the period which would be applicable under subdivision one,
      two  or three, if on the date of the mailing of the notice of deficiency
      a claim had been filed (whether or not filed) stating  the  ground  upon
      which the tax appeals tribunal finds that there is an overpayment.
        For  special  restriction  on  credit  or  refund in a proceeding on a
      petition for  redetermination  of  a  deficiency  where  the  notice  of
      deficiency  is issued as a result of (i) a net operating loss carryback,
      or (ii) an increase or decrease in federal or  New  York  state  taxable
      income  or other basis of tax or federal or New York state tax, or (iii)
      a federal or New York state change or correction  or  renegotiation,  or
      computation or recomputation of tax, which is treated in the same manner
      as  if  it  were  a  deficiency for federal or New York state income tax
      purposes, see paragraph (g) of subdivision three of  section  11-674  of
      this subchapter.
        8. Early return. For purposes of this section, any return filed before
      the  last  day  prescribed for the filing thereof shall be considered as
      filed on such last day, determined without regard to  any  extension  of
      time granted the taxpayer.
        9.  Prepaid  tax.  For  purposes  of this section, any tax paid by the
      taxpayer before the last day prescribed for its payment  (including  any
      amount  paid  by the taxpayer as estimated tax for a taxable year) shall
      be deemed to have been paid by it on the  fifteenth  day  of  the  third
      month following the close of the taxable year the income of which is the
      basis  for  tax under subchapter two or three of this chapter, or on the
      last day prescribed in part one of subchapter three or  subchapter  four
      for  the  filing  of  a  final  return for such taxable year, or portion
      thereof, determined in all cases without regard to any extension of time
      granted the taxpayer.
        10. Cross reference.  For  provision  barring  refund  of  overpayment
      credited  against  tax  of  a  succeeding  year,  see subdivision two of
      section 11-677 of this subchapter.
        11. Notice of change or correction of sales and compensating  use  tax
      liability.  (a)  If  a  taxpayer  is  required by subchapter two of this
      chapter to file a report or amended return in respect  of  a  change  or
      correction  of  its  sales and compensating use tax liability, claim for
      credit or refund of any resulting overpayment of tax shall be  filed  by
      the  taxpayer  within  two  years  from  the time such report or amended
      return was required to be filed with the commissioner  of  finance.  The
      amount  of such credit or refund shall be computed without change of the
      allocation of income or capital upon which the taxpayer's return (or any
      additional assessment) was based, and shall not exceed the amount of the
      reduction in tax attributable to such change or correction of sales  and
      compensating use tax liability.
        (b)  This  subdivision  shall  not affect the time within which or the
      amount for which a claim for credit or refund may be  filed  apart  from
      this subdivision.

Section 11-679 ::    
        
     
        ยง  11-679  Interest  on  overpayment.  1. General. Notwithstanding the
      provisions of section three-a of the  general  municipal  law,  interest
      shall  be allowed and paid as follows at the overpayment rate set by the
      commissioner of finance pursuant to section 11-687 of  this  subchapter,
      or,  if  no  rate  is set, at the rate of six percent per annum upon any
      overpayment  in  respect  to  the  tax  imposed  by  any  of  the  named
      subchapters:
        (a)  from  the  date  of  the overpayment to the due date of an amount
      against which a credit is taken;
        (b) from the date of the overpayment to a date (to  be  determined  by
      the commissioner of finance) preceding the date of a refund check by not
      more  than  thirty days, whether or not such refund check is accepted by
      the taxpayer after tender of such check to the taxpayer. The  acceptance
      of such check shall be without prejudice to any right of the taxpayer to
      claim any additional overpayment and interest thereon.
        (c)  Late  and  amended  returns  and  claims  for  credit  or refund.
      Notwithstanding paragraph (a) or (b) of this subdivision, in the case of
      an overpayment claimed on a return of tax which is filed after the  last
      date  prescribed  for  filing  such  return  (determined  with regard to
      extensions), or claimed on an amended return of  tax  or  claimed  on  a
      claim for credit or refund, no interest shall be allowed or paid for any
      day before the date on which such return or claim is filed.
        (d)  Interest  on  certain  refunds.  To  the  extent  provided for in
      regulations promulgated by the commissioner of finance, if  an  item  of
      income, gain, loss, deduction or credit is changed from the taxable year
      or period in which it is reported to the taxable year or period in which
      it  belongs  and the change results in an underpayment in a taxable year
      or period and an overpayment in some other taxable year or  period,  the
      provisions  of  paragraph  (c)  of  this  subdivision with respect to an
      overpayment shall not be applicable to the extent that the limitation in
      such paragraph on the right to interest would result in a  taxpayer  not
      being  allowed  interest  for  a  length  of  time  with  respect  to an
      overpayment while being required to pay interest on an equivalent amount
      of the related  underpayment.  However,  this  paragraph  shall  be  not
      construed  as  limiting  or  mitigating  the  effect  of  any statute of
      limitations or any other provision of law relating to the  authority  of
      such  commissioner  to issue a notice of deficiency or to allow a credit
      or refund of an overpayment.
        (e) Amounts of less than one dollar. No interest shall be  allowed  or
      paid if the amount thereof is less than one dollar.
        2.  Advance  payment  of  tax  and  estimated  tax.  The provisions of
      subdivisions eight  and  nine  of  section  11-678  of  this  subchapter
      applicable  in  determining  the  date of payment of tax for purposes of
      determining the period of limitations on  credit  or  refund,  shall  be
      applicable  in  determining  the  date  of  payment for purposes of this
      section.
        3. Tax refund within three months of claim  for  overpayment.  If  any
      overpayment  of  tax imposed by any of the named subchapters is credited
      or refunded within three months  after  the  last  date  prescribed  (or
      permitted  by  extension  of  time) for filing the return of such tax on
      which such overpayment was claimed or within  three  months  after  such
      return  was  filed,  whichever is later, or within three months after an
      amended return was filed  claiming  such  overpayment  or  within  three
      months  after  a  claim  for  credit  or  refund was filed on which such
      overpayment was claimed, no interest shall be allowed under this section
      on any such overpayment. For purposes of this subdivision,  any  amended
      return  or  claim  for  credit  or  refund  filed  before  the  last day
      prescribed (or permitted by extension of time) for  the  filing  of  the
    
      return  of  tax  for such year or period shall be considered as filed on
      such last day.
        4. Refund of tax caused by carryback. For purposes of this section, if
      any overpayment of tax imposed by subchapter two of this chapter results
      from  a  carryback  of  a net operating loss or a net capital loss, such
      overpayment shall be deemed not to have been made prior  to  the  filing
      date  for  the  taxable  year  in  which  such net operating loss or net
      capital loss arises. Such filing date shall be determined without regard
      to extensions of time to file. For purposes of subdivision three of this
      section  any  overpayment  described  herein  shall  be  treated  as  an
      overpayment for the loss year and such subdivision shall be applied with
      respect  to such overpayment by treating the return for the loss year as
      not filed before claim for such overpayment is  filed.  The  term  "loss
      year" means the taxable year in which such loss arises.
        5. No interest until return in processible form.
        (a)  For  purposes  of  subdivisions  one and three of this section, a
      return shall not be treated as filed until it is  filed  in  processible
      form.
        (b)  For purposes of paragraph (a) of this subdivision, a return is in
      a processible form if:
        (A) such return is filed on a permitted form, and
        (B) such return contains:
        (i) the taxpayer's name;  address,  and  identifying  number  and  the
      required signatures, and
        (ii)  sufficient  required  information  (whether  on the return or on
      required attachments) to permit the  mathematical  verification  of  tax
      liability shown on the return.
        6.  Cross  reference.  For  provision  with  respect to interest after
      failure to file a  report  of  federal  or  New  York  state  change  or
      correction  or  amended  return  under  subchapter  two  or  three,  see
      subdivision three of section 11-678 of this subchapter.

Section 11-680 ::    
        
     
        ยง  11-680  Petition to tax appeals tribunal. 1. General. The form of a
      petition to the tax appeals tribunal, and further proceedings before the
      tax appeals tribunal in any case initiated by the filing of a  petition,
      shall  be  governed  by  such  rules  as  the tax appeals tribunal shall
      prescribe. No petition shall be denied  in  whole  or  in  part  without
      opportunity  for  a hearing on reasonable prior notice. Such hearing and
      any appeal to the tribunal sitting en banc from the decision rendered in
      such hearing shall be  conducted  in  the  manner  and  subject  to  the
      requirements prescribed by the tax appeals tribunal pursuant to sections
      one  hundred sixty-eight through one hundred seventy-two of the charter.
      A decision of the tax appeals tribunal shall  be  rendered,  and  notice
      thereof  shall  be  given, in the manner provided by section one hundred
      seventy-one of the charter.
        2. Petition for redetermination of a deficiency. Within  ninety  days,
      or one hundred fifty days if the notice is addressed to a taxpayer whose
      last known address is outside of the United States, after the mailing of
      the   notice   of  deficiency  authorized  by  section  11-672  of  this
      subchapter,  or  if  the  commissioner  of  finance  has  established  a
      conciliation  procedure  pursuant  to section 11-124 of the code and the
      taxpayer  has  requested  a  conciliation   conference   in   accordance
      therewith,  after  ninety  days  from  the  mailing  of the conciliation
      decision  or  the  date  of  the  commissioner's  confirmation  of   the
      discontinuance  of  the conciliation proceeding, the taxpayer may file a
      petition with the  tax  appeals  tribunal  for  redetermination  of  the
      deficiency.  Such  petition  may  also assert a claim for refund for the
      same taxable year or years, subject to the  limitations  of  subdivision
      seven  of  section  11-678  of  this subchapter. For special restriction
      where the notice of deficiency relates to a proposed assessment made  as
      a result of: (a) a net operating loss carry back or a capital loss carry
      back,  (b)  an increase or decrease in federal or New York state taxable
      income or other basis of tax or federal or New York state tax, or (c)  a
      federal  or  New  York  state  change or correction or renegotiation, or
      computation or recomputation of tax, which is treated in the same manner
      as if it were a deficiency for federal or  New  York  state  income  tax
      purposes,  see  paragraph  (g) of subdivision three of section 11-674 of
      this subchapter.
        3. Petition for refund. A taxpayer may file a petition  with  the  tax
      appeals tribunal for the amounts asserted in a claim for refund if:
        (a)  the  taxpayer  has  filed  a  timely  claim  for  refund with the
      commissioner of finance,
        (b) the taxpayer  has  not  previously  filed  with  the  tax  appeals
      tribunal  a  timely  petition under subdivision two for the same taxable
      year unless the petition under this subdivision relates  to  a  separate
      claim  for  credit  or  refund  properly  filed under subdivision six of
      section 11-678 of this subchapter, and
        (c) either: (1) six months have expired since the claim was filed,  or
      (2)  the  commissioner  of  finance  has  mailed  to  the  taxpayer,  by
      registered or certified mail, a notice of disallowance of such claim  in
      whole or in part.
        No  petition under this subdivision shall be filed more than two years
      after the date of mailing of a notice of disallowance, unless  prior  to
      the  expiration  of such two year period it has been extended by written
      agreement between the taxpayer and the commissioner  of  finance.  If  a
      taxpayer  files a written waiver of the requirement that the taxpayer be
      mailed a notice of disallowance, the two year period prescribed by  this
      subdivision  for  filing  a  petition for refund shall begin on the date
      such waiver is filed.
    
        (d) If the commissioner of  finance  has  established  a  conciliation
      procedure  pursuant  to  section 11-124 of the code, a taxpayer which is
      eligible to file a petition for refund with  the  tax  appeals  tribunal
      pursuant to this subdivision may request a conciliation conference prior
      to  filing  such  petition, provided the request is made within the time
      prescribed for filing the petition.  Notwithstanding  anything  in  this
      subdivision   to   the   contrary,  if  the  taxpayer  has  requested  a
      conciliation conference in accordance  with  the  procedure  established
      pursuant  to  section  11-124  of the code, a petition for refund may be
      filed no later than ninety days from the  mailing  of  the  conciliation
      decision   or  the  date  of  the  commissioner's  confirmation  of  the
      discontinuance of the conciliation proceeding.
        4. Assertion of deficiency after filing petition.
        (a) Petition for redetermination of deficiency. If  a  taxpayer  files
      with  the  tax  appeals  tribunal  a  petition  for redetermination of a
      deficiency, the tax appeals tribunal shall have  power  to  determine  a
      greater  deficiency  than  asserted  in  the notice of deficiency and to
      determine if there should be assessed any addition  to  tax  or  penalty
      provided  in  section  11-676  of  this subchapter, if claim therefor is
      asserted at or before  the  hearing  under  rules  of  the  tax  appeals
      tribunal.
        (b)  Petition  for  refund. If the taxpayer files with the tax appeals
      tribunal a petition for credit or refund for a  taxable  year,  the  tax
      appeals tribunal may:
        (1)  determine  a  deficiency  for  such  year  as  to  any  amount of
      deficiency asserted at or before the hearing  under  rules  of  the  tax
      appeals  tribunal  and within the period in which an assessment would be
      timely under section 11-674 of this subchapter, or
        (2) deny so much of the amount for which credit or refund is sought in
      the petition, as is offset  by  other  issues  pertaining  to  the  same
      taxable  year which are asserted at or before the hearing under rules of
      the tax appeals tribunal.
        (c) Opportunity to respond. A taxpayer shall  be  given  a  reasonable
      opportunity  to  respond  to any matters asserted by the commissioner of
      finance under this subdivision.
        (d) Restriction on further notices  of  deficiency.  If  the  taxpayer
      files  a  petition  with the tax appeals tribunal under this section, no
      notice of  deficiency  under  section  11-672  of  this  subchapter  may
      thereafter be issued by the commissioner of finance for the same taxable
      year, except in case of fraud or with respect to an increase or decrease
      in federal or New York state taxable income, alternative minimum taxable
      income  or  other  basis  of  tax  or federal or New York state tax or a
      federal or New York state change  or  correction  or  renegotiation,  or
      computation or recomputation of tax, which is treated in the same manner
      as  if  it  were  a  deficiency for federal or New York state income tax
      purposes, required to be reported under subchapter two or three of  this
      chapter  or  with  respect  to a state change or correction of sales and
      compensating use tax liability required to be reported under  subchapter
      two of this chapter.
        5.  Burden of proof. In any case before the tax appeals tribunal under
      this subchapter, the burden of proof shall be upon the petitioner except
      for the following issues, as to which the burden of proof shall be  upon
      the commissioner of finance:
        (a)  whether  the  petitioner  has been guilty of fraud with intent to
      evade tax;
        (b) whether the petitioner is liable as the transferee of property  of
      a taxpayer, but not to show that the taxpayer was liable for the tax;
    
        (c)  whether the petitioner is liable for any increase in a deficiency
      where such increase is asserted initially after a notice  of  deficiency
      was mailed and a petition under this section filed, unless such increase
      in deficiency is the result of an increase or decrease in federal or New
      York  state  taxable income, alternative minimum taxable income or other
      basis of tax or federal or New York state tax or a federal or  New  York
      state   change   or  correction  or  renegotiation,  or  computation  or
      recomputation of tax, which is treated in the same manner as if it  were
      a deficiency for federal or New York state income tax purposes, required
      to  be  reported  under  subchapter two or three of this chapter, and of
      which increase, decrease, change  or  correction  or  renegotiation,  or
      computation  or recomputation, the commissioner of finance had no notice
      at the time he or she mailed the notice of  deficiency  or  unless  such
      increase  in deficiency is the result of a change or correction of sales
      and compensating  use  tax  liability  required  to  be  reported  under
      subchapter  two  of  this chapter, and of which change or correction the
      commissioner of finance had no notice at the time he or she  mailed  the
      notice of deficiency; and
        (d)  whether  any  person  is  liable  for a penalty under subdivision
      twelve of section 11-676.
        6. Evidence of related federal or state determination. Evidence  of  a
      federal  or  state  determination  relating  to  issues raised in a case
      before the tax appeals tribunal under this section shall be  admissible,
      under rules established by the tax appeals tribunal.
        7.  Jurisdiction  over  other  years.  The  tax appeals tribunal shall
      consider such facts with relation to the taxes for other years as may be
      necessary correctly to determine the tax for the taxable year, but in so
      doing shall have no jurisdiction to determine whether or not the tax for
      any other year has been overpaid or underpaid.

Section 11-681 ::    
        
     
        ยง  11-681  Review  of  tax  appeals tribunal's decision. 1. General. A
      decision of the tax appeals tribunal sitting en banc shall be subject to
      judicial review at the instance of any taxpayer affected thereby in  the
      manner  provided  by law for the review of a final decision or action of
      administrative agencies of the city. An application by  a  taxpayer  for
      such review must be made within four months after notice of the decision
      is sent by certified mail, return receipt requested, to the taxpayer and
      the commissioner of finance.
        2.  Judicial  review exclusive remedy. The review of a decision of the
      tax appeals tribunal provided by this section  shall  be  the  exclusive
      remedy  available  to any taxpayer for the judicial determination of the
      liability  of  the  taxpayer  for  the  taxes  imposed  by   the   named
      subchapters.
        3.  Assessment  pending  review;  review  bond.  Irrespective  of  any
      restrictions on the  assessment  and  collection  of  deficiencies,  the
      commissioner  of  finance  may assess a deficiency determined by the tax
      appeals tribunal in a decision rendered pursuant to section one  hundred
      seventy-one  of the charter after the expiration of the period specified
      in subdivision one, notwithstanding that  an  application  for  judicial
      review  in respect of such deficiency has been duly made by the taxpayer
      unless the taxpayer, at or before the time  the  taxpayer's  application
      for  review  is  made,  has  paid the deficiency, has deposited with the
      commissioner of finance the amount of the deficiency, or has filed  with
      the  commissioner  of finance a bond (which may be a jeopardy bond under
      subdivision eight of section 11-685 of this subchapter) in the amount of
      the portion of the deficiency (including interest and other amounts)  in
      respect  of  which  the application for review is made and all costs and
      charges which may accrue against the taxpayer in the prosecution of  the
      proceeding,  including costs of all appeals, and with surety approved by
      a justice of the supreme  court  of  the  state,  conditioned  upon  the
      payment  of  the  deficiency  (including  interest and other amounts) as
      finally determined and such costs and charges. If,  as  a  result  of  a
      waiver  of  the  restrictions  on  the  assessment  and  collection of a
      deficiency, any part  of  the  amount  determined  by  the  tax  appeals
      tribunal  is  paid after the filing of the review bond, such bond shall,
      at the request of the taxpayer, be proportionately reduced.
        4. Credit, refund or abatement  after  review.  If  the  amount  of  a
      deficiency determined by the tax appeals tribunal is disallowed in whole
      or  in  part  by  the court of review, the amount so disallowed shall be
      credited or refunded to  the  taxpayer,  without  the  making  of  claim
      therefor, or, if payment has not been made, shall be abated.
        5.  Date  of  finality of tax appeals tribunal decision. A decision of
      the tax appeals tribunal shall become final upon the expiration  of  the
      period  specified  in  subdivision  one  for  making  an application for
      review, if no such application has been duly made within such  time,  or
      if  such application has been duly made, upon expiration of the time for
      all further judicial review, or upon the rendering by  the  tax  appeals
      tribunal  of  a  decision in accordance with the mandate of the court on
      review. Notwithstanding the foregoing, for  the  purpose  of  making  an
      application  for  review, the decision of the tax appeals tribunal shall
      be deemed final on the date the notice of decision is sent by  certified
      mail to the taxpayer and the commissioner of finance.

Section 11-682 ::    
        
     
        ยง  11-682  Mailing rules; holidays; miscellaneous.  1. Timely mailing.
      (a) If any return,  declaration  of  estimated  tax,  claim,  statement,
      notice, petition, or other document required to be filed, or any payment
      required  to  be  made,  within  a  prescribed  period or on or before a
      prescribed date under authority of any provision of this  subchapter  or
      of  the  named subchapters is, after such period or such date, delivered
      by United States mail  to  the  commissioner  of  finance,  tax  appeals
      tribunal, bureau, office, officer or person with which or with whom such
      document is required to be filed, or to which or to whom such payment is
      required  to  be made, the date of the United States postmark stamped on
      the  envelope  shall  be  deemed  to  be  the  date  of  delivery.  This
      subdivision  shall  apply  only  if  the  postmark date falls within the
      prescribed period or on or before the prescribed date for the filing  of
      such  document,  or  for  making  the  payment,  including any extension
      granted for such filing or payment, and only if such document or payment
      was deposited in the mail, postage prepaid, properly  addressed  to  the
      commissioner  of  finance, tax appeals tribunal, bureau, office, officer
      or person with which or with whom the document is required to  be  filed
      or  to  which  or  to  whom  such payment is required to be made. If any
      document is sent by United States  registered  mail,  such  registration
      shall  be  prima  facie evidence that such document was delivered to the
      commissioner of finance, tax appeals tribunal, bureau,  office,  officer
      or  person  to  which  or  to  whom  addressed.  To  the extent that the
      commissioner of finance or, where relevant,  the  tax  appeals  tribunal
      shall  prescribe  by  regulation,  certified mail may be used in lieu of
      registered mail under this subdivision. Except as provided in  paragraph
      (b)  of  this  subdivision,  this subdivision shall apply in the case of
      postmarks not made by the United States postal service only  if  and  to
      the  extent  provided  by regulations of the commissioner of finance or,
      where relevant, the tax appeals tribunal.
        (b) (i) Any reference in paragraph (a)  of  this  subdivision  to  the
      United  States  mail  shall  be  treated as including a reference to any
      delivery service designated by the secretary  of  the  treasury  of  the
      United  States  pursuant  to  section  seventy-five  hundred  two of the
      internal revenue code  and  any  reference  in  paragraph  (a)  of  this
      subdivision  to a United States postmark shall be treated as including a
      reference to any date recorded or marked  in  the  manner  described  in
      section  seventy-five  hundred  two  of  the  internal revenue code by a
      designated delivery service. If the commissioner of finance  finds  that
      any  delivery service designated by such secretary is inadequate for the
      needs of the city, the commissioner may withdraw  such  designation  for
      purposes  of  this title. The commissioner may also designate additional
      delivery services meeting the criteria of section  seventy-five  hundred
      two  of  the  internal  revenue  code for purposes of this title, or may
      withdraw any such designation if the commissioner of finance finds  that
      a  delivery  service  so  designated  is inadequate for the needs of the
      city. Any reference in paragraph (a) of this subdivision to  the  United
      States  mail  shall  be treated as including a reference to any delivery
      service designated by the commissioner of finance and any  reference  in
      paragraph  (a)  of this subdivision to a United States postmark shall be
      treated as including a reference to any date recorded or marked  in  the
      manner  described  in  section  seventy-five hundred two of the internal
      revenue code by a delivery service designated  by  the  commissioner  of
      finance.    Notwithstanding the foregoing, any withdrawal of designation
      or additional designation by the commissioner of finance  shall  not  be
      effective  for purposes of service upon the tax appeals tribunal, unless
      and until such withdrawal of designation or  additional  designation  is
      ratified by the president of the tax appeals tribunal.
    
        (ii)  Any equivalent of registered or certified mail designated by the
      United States secretary of the treasury, or as may be designated by  the
      commissioner  of  finance  pursuant  to  the  same criteria used by such
      secretary for such designations pursuant to section seventy-five hundred
      two  of  the internal revenue code, shall be included within the meaning
      of registered or certified  mail  as  used  in  paragraph  (a)  of  this
      subdivision. If the commissioner of finance finds that any equivalent of
      registered  or  certified  mail  designated  by  such  secretary  or the
      commissioner of finance is inadequate for the needs  of  the  city,  the
      commissioner  of  finance  may withdraw such designation for purposes of
      this title. Notwithstanding the foregoing, any withdrawal of designation
      or additional designation by the commissioner of finance  shall  not  be
      effective  for purposes of service upon the tax appeals tribunal, unless
      and until such withdrawal of designation or  additional  designation  is
      ratified by the president of the tax appeals tribunal.
        2.  Last  known address. For purposes of this subchapter, a taxpayer's
      last known address shall be the address given in the last  return  filed
      by  it,  unless  subsequently  to the filing of such return the taxpayer
      shall have notified the commissioner of finance of a change of address.
        3. Last day a Saturday, Sunday or legal holiday.  When  the  last  day
      prescribed  under  authority of this subchapter or the named subchapters
      (including any extension of time) for performing  any  act  falls  on  a
      Saturday, Sunday, or legal holiday in the state, the performance of such
      act shall be considered timely if it is performed on the next succeeding
      day which is not a Saturday, Sunday or legal holiday.
        4.  Certificate;  unfiled  return. For purposes of this subchapter and
      sections one hundred sixty-eight through one hundred seventy-two of  the
      charter,  the  certificate  of the commissioner of finance to the effect
      that a tax has not been paid, that a return or declaration of  estimated
      tax  has  not  been filed, or that information has not been supplied, as
      required by or under the provisions of  this  chapter,  shall  be  prima
      facie  evidence  that  such  tax  has not been paid, that such return or
      declaration has not been filed, or that such information  has  not  been
      supplied.

Section 11-683 ::    
        
     
        ยง  11-683  Collection,  levy  and liens. 1. Collection procedures. The
      taxes imposed by  the  named  subchapters  shall  be  collected  by  the
      commissioner  of  finance,  and he or she may establish the mode or time
      for the collection of any amount  due  him  or  her  thereunder  if  not
      otherwise  specified.  The  commissioner of finance shall, upon request,
      give a receipt for any sum collected  thereunder.  The  commissioner  of
      finance may authorize banks or trust companies which are depositaries or
      financial  agents  of the city to receive and give a receipt for any tax
      imposed under the named subchapters in such manner, at such  times,  and
      under  such conditions as the commissioner of finance may prescribe; and
      the commissioner of  finance  shall  prescribe  the  manner,  times  and
      conditions  under  which the receipt of such tax by such banks and trust
      companies is to be treated as payment of such tax to the commissioner of
      finance.
        2. Notice and demand for tax. The commissioner  of  finance  shall  as
      soon  as  practicable give notice to each taxpayer liable for any amount
      of tax, addition to tax, penalty or interest, which  has  been  assessed
      but  remains  unpaid,  stating the amount and demanding payment thereof.
      Such notice shall be left at the principal office of the taxpayer in the
      city or shall be sent by mail to such  taxpayer's  last  known  address.
      Except  where  the  commissioner  of  finance determines that collection
      would be jeopardized by delay, if any tax is assessed prior to the  last
      date  (including  any date fixed by extension) prescribed for payment of
      such tax, payment of such tax shall not be  demanded  until  after  such
      date.
        3.  Issuance of warrant after notice and demand. If any corporation or
      other person liable under the named subchapters for the payment  of  any
      tax, addition to tax, penalty or interest neglects or refuses to pay the
      same  within  ten days after notice and demand therefor is given to such
      corporation or other person under subdivision two, the  commissioner  of
      finance  may  within six years after the date of such assessment issue a
      warrant directed to the sheriff of any county of the state,  or  to  any
      officer  or employee of the department of finance, commanding him or her
      to levy upon and sell the real and personal property of such corporation
      or other person for the payment of the amount assessed, with the cost of
      executing the warrant, and to return such warrant to the commissioner of
      finance, and pay to the  commissioner  the  money  collected  by  virtue
      thereof  within  sixty  days  after  the  receipt of the warrant. If the
      commissioner of finance finds that the collection of the  tax  or  other
      amount  is  in jeopardy, notice and demand for immediate payment of such
      tax may be made by the commissioner  of  finance  and  upon  failure  or
      refusal  to pay such tax or other amount the commissioner of finance may
      issue a warrant without regard to the ten-day period  provided  in  this
      subdivision.
        4.  Copy of warrant to be filed and lien to be created. Any sheriff or
      officer or employee who receives a warrant under subdivision three shall
      within  five  days  thereafter  file  a  copy  with  the  clerk  of  the
      appropriate  county.  The  clerk  shall  thereupon enter in the judgment
      docket, in the column for judgment debtors, the  name  of  the  taxpayer
      mentioned  in  the  warrant, and in appropriate columns the tax or other
      amounts for which the warrant is issued and the date when such  copy  is
      filed;  and such amount shall thereupon be a binding lien upon the real,
      personal and other property of the taxpayer.
        5. Judgment. When a warrant has been filed with the county  clerk  the
      commissioner  of finance shall, on behalf of the city, be deemed to have
      obtained judgment against the taxpayer for the tax or other amounts.
        6. Execution. The sheriff  or  officer  or  employee  shall  thereupon
      proceed  upon the judgment in all respects, with like effect, and in the
    
      same manner prescribed by law in respect to  executions  issued  against
      property  upon  judgments  of  a court of record, and a sheriff shall be
      entitled to the same fees for his  or  her  services  in  executing  the
      warrant,  to  be collected in the same manner. An officer or employee of
      the department of finance may proceed in any county or counties of  this
      state  and  shall have all the powers of execution conferred by law upon
      sheriffs, but shall be entitled to no fee or compensation in  excess  of
      actual expenses paid in connection with the execution of the warrant.
        7.  Foreign  corporations. Where a notice and demand under subdivision
      two shall have been given to a foreign corporation or other  person  who
      is  not  then  a resident, and it appears to the commissioner of finance
      that it is not practicable to find in the state property of such foreign
      corporation or nonresident person sufficient to pay the  entire  balance
      of   tax   or   other  amount  owing  by  such  foreign  corporation  or
      nonresidential person, the commissioner of finance  may,  in  accordance
      with  subdivision  three,  issue  a  warrant  directed  to an officer or
      employee of the department of finance, a copy of which warrant shall  be
      mailed  by  certified  or registered mail to such foreign corporation or
      nonresident person at its last known address, subject to  the  rules  of
      mailing  provided  in  subdivision  one  of section 11-672. Such warrant
      shall command the officer or employee to proceed in New York county, and
      he or she shall, within five days after receipt of the warrant, file the
      warrant and obtain a judgment in accordance with this section. Thereupon
      the commissioner of finance may authorize the institution of any  action
      or proceeding to collect or enforce the judgment in any place and by any
      procedure that a civil judgment of the supreme court of the state of New
      York  could  be  collected  or enforced. The commissioner of finance may
      also, in his or her discretion, designate agents or retain  counsel  for
      the  purpose  of  collecting,  outside  the  state,  any  unpaid  taxes,
      additions to tax, penalties or interest which have been  assessed  under
      this  subchapter  or under any of the named subchapters, against foreign
      corporations or other non-resident persons, may fix the compensation  of
      such  agents  and  counsel  to  be  paid  out  of  money appropriated or
      otherwise lawfully available for payment thereof,  and  may  require  of
      them  bonds  or  other  security  for  the faithful performance of their
      duties, in such form and in such amount as the commissioner  of  finance
      shall deem proper and sufficient.
        8.  Action by city for recovery of taxes. Action may be brought by the
      corporation counsel of the city at the instance of the  commissioner  of
      finance  to  recover  the  amount of any unpaid taxes, additions to tax,
      penalties or interest which have been assessed under this subchapter  or
      under  the  named  subchapters  within  six  years prior to the date the
      action is commenced.
        9. Release of lien or vacating warrant. The commissioner  of  finance,
      if  he  or  she finds that the interests of the city will not thereby be
      jeopardized, and upon such conditions as the commissioner of finance may
      require, may release any property from the lien of any warrant or vacate
      such warrant for unpaid taxes, additions to tax, penalties and  interest
      filed  pursuant  to  subdivision four or seven of this section, and such
      release or vacating of the warrant may be recorded in the office of  any
      recording  officer in which such warrant has been filed. The clerk shall
      thereupon cancel and discharge as of the original date of docketing  the
      vacated warrant.
        10.  Lien  from  due date of return. (a) In addition to any other lien
      provided for in this section, each tax imposed by the named  subchapters
      shall  become  a  lien on the date on which the return is required to be
      filed (without regard to any extension of time for filing such  return),
      except  that  such  tax  shall become a lien not later than the date the
    
      taxpayer ceases to be subject to the tax imposed by  any  of  the  named
      subchapters, or to do business in this state in a corporate or organized
      capacity.  Each  such  tax shall be a lien and binding upon the real and
      personal  property of the taxpayer, or of a transferee liable to pay the
      same, until the same is paid in  full,  except  that  no  lien  for  any
      additional tax assessed pursuant to this subchapter shall be enforceable
      against property which prior to the issuance to the taxpayer of a notice
      of   deficiency  under  section  11-672  of  this  subchapter  had  been
      transferred in good faith to a bona fide transferee for value.  But  the
      lien  of  each  such  tax  shall  be subject to the lien of any mortgage
      indebtedness existing against real property previous to  the  time  when
      the  tax  became  a  lien  and where such mortgage indebtedness has been
      incurred in good faith and was not given, directly or indirectly, to any
      officer or stockholder of the corporation  owning  such  real  property,
      whether  as  a  purchase  money mortgage or otherwise, and shall also be
      subject to the lien of local taxes and assessments,  without  regard  to
      when  the  lien  for such taxes and assessments may have accrued. If the
      return is filed and the tax shown on the report to be due is paid on  or
      before  the  date  on  which the report is required to be filed, without
      regard to any extensions of time for filing such report, the lien  shall
      not be enforceable against the interest of any purchaser or mortgagee in
      property  which is thereafter, but prior to the issuance to the taxpayer
      of a notice of  deficiency  under  section  11-672  of  this  subchapter
      transferred  to  a bona fide purchaser for value, or mortgaged where the
      mortgage indebtedness is incurred in good faith and the mortgage is  not
      given,  directly  or  indirectly,  to  any officer or stockholder of the
      corporation. In any  action  to  foreclose  any  such  mortgage,  or  to
      foreclose the lien of local taxes or assessments, to which the people of
      the  state, or the city shall have been made a party defendant by reason
      of the existence of a lien for any such tax, or if no such tax  was  due
      or  was  a  lien  at the time of the commencement of such action and the
      filing of the notice of pendency thereof but such a tax becomes  due  or
      becomes a lien subsequent to the time of the commencement of such action
      and  the  filing  of  the notice of pendency thereof, such real property
      shall be sold and conveyed in such action free from any such  tax  lien,
      and  any such tax lien may become a lien on any surplus moneys which may
      result from such sale, to be  determined  in  the  proceedings  for  the
      distribution of such surplus moneys. Where title to real property passes
      from  an  individual,  or  from  a  corporation owing no tax, to another
      corporation which is in default for such tax, the lien  herein  provided
      shall  not  be  enforceable  except  as  to  any  equity after the prior
      mortgage or purchase money mortgage encumbrance.
        (b) The commissioner of finance may,  upon  application  made  to  the
      commissioner  and  the  payment of a fee of twenty-five dollars, release
      any real property from the lien under this subdivision, provided payment
      be made to the commissioner of finance of such a sum as the commissioner
      of finance shall  deem  adequate  consideration  for  such  release,  or
      deposit  be  made  of  such  security  or  such  bond  be  filed  as the
      commissioner of finance shall deem proper to secure payment of any  such
      tax.  The  application  for  such  release  shall  contain  an  accurate
      description  of  the  property  to  be  released  together   with   such
      information as the commissioner of finance may require. Such release may
      be  recorded  in  any  office  in  which  conveyances of real estate are
      entitled to be recorded.
        (c) All taxes, additions to tax, penalties  and  interest  which  have
      become  a lien under this subdivision shall cease to be a lien after the
      expiration of twenty years from the date they become  due  and  payable,
      except  that  taxes, additions to tax, penalties and interest which have
    
      become a lien under this subdivision (1) as to real estate in the  hands
      of  persons who are owners thereof who would be purchasers in good faith
      but for such taxes, additions to tax, penalties or interest and  (2)  as
      to  the  lien  on  real estate of mortgages held by persons who would be
      holders thereof in good faith but for  such  taxes,  additions  to  tax,
      penalties  or  interest,  as  against  such purchasers or holders, shall
      cease to be a lien after the expiration of ten years from the date  they
      become  due  and  payable. The limitations herein provided for shall not
      apply to any transfer from a corporation to a person or corporation with
      intent to avoid payment of any taxes, or  where  with  like  intent  the
      transfer  is  made  to  a grantee corporation, or any subsequent grantee
      corporation, controlled by such grantor or which has  any  community  of
      interest with it, either through stock ownership or otherwise.
    
    
    
    
    
    
    

Section 11-684
--------------

Section 11-684 ::    
        
     
        ยง  11-684 Transferees. 1. General. The liability, at law or in equity,
      of a transferee of property of a taxpayer for any tax, additions to tax,
      penalty  or  interest  due  the  commissioner  of  finance  under   this
      subchapter  or under the named subchapters, shall be assessed, paid, and
      collected in the same manner and subject  to  the  same  provisions  and
      limitations  as  in  the case of the tax to which the liability relates,
      except that  the  period  of  limitations  for  assessment  against  the
      transferee  shall  be extended by one year for each successive transfer,
      in order, from the original taxpayer to the transferee involved, but not
      by more than three years in the aggregate. The term transferee includes,
      in  case  of  successive  transfers,  donee,  heir,  legatee,   devisee,
      distributee,   and   successor   by   merger,   consolidation  or  other
      reorganization.
        2. Exceptions.
        (a) If  before  the  expiration  of  the  period  of  limitations  for
      assessment of liability of the transferee, a claim has been filed by the
      commissioner  of  finance  in any court against the original taxpayer or
      the last preceding transferee based upon the liability of  the  original
      taxpayer,  then  the period of limitation for assessment of liability of
      the transferee shall in no event expire prior to  one  year  after  such
      claim has been finally allowed, disallowed or otherwise disposed of.
        (b)  If,  before  the expiration of the time prescribed in subdivision
      one or the immediately preceding paragraph of this subdivision  for  the
      assessment  of  the  liability,  the  commissioner  of  finance  and the
      transferee have both consented in writing to its assessment  after  such
      time,  the liability may be assessed at any time prior to the expiration
      of the period agreed upon. The period so agreed upon may be extended  by
      subsequent  agreements  in  writing  made  before  the expiration of the
      period previously agreed upon. For the purpose of determining the period
      of limitation on credit or refund to the transferee or  overpayments  of
      tax  made  by  such  transferee  or  overpayments  of  tax  made  by the
      transferor as to which the transferee is legally entitled to  credit  or
      refund,  such  agreement  and  any  extension thereof shall be deemed an
      agreement and extension  thereof  referred  to  in  subdivision  two  of
      section  11-678  of  this subchapter. If the agreement is executed after
      the expiration of the period of limitation for  assessment  against  the
      original  taxpayer,  then  in applying the limitations under subdivision
      two of section 11-678 of this subchapter on the amount of the credit  or
      refund,  the  period  specified  in subdivision one of section 11-678 of
      this subchapter shall be increased by the period from the date  of  such
      expiration to the date of the agreement.
        3.  Period for assessment against certain transferors. For purposes of
      this section, if any person is deceased or is a  corporation  which  has
      terminated  its  existence,  the  period  of  limitation  for assessment
      against such person or corporation shall be the  period  that  would  be
      effect had death or termination of existence not occurred.
        4.  Evidence.  The commissioner of finance shall use his or her powers
      to make available to the transferee evidence  necessary  to  enable  the
      transferee  to  determine  the liability of the original taxpayer and of
      any preceding transferees, but without undue hardship  to  the  original
      taxpayer or preceding transferee. See subdivision five of section 11-680
      of this subchapter for rule as to burden of proof.
    
    
    
    
    
    
    

Section 11-685
--------------

Section 11-685 ::    
        
     
        ยง  11-685  Jeopardy  assessments.  1.  Authority  for  making.  If the
      commissioner of finance believes that the assessment or collection of  a
      deficiency  will  be  jeopardized  by  delay,  the  commissioner  shall,
      notwithstanding the provisions of  section  11-672  of  this  subchapter
      immediately   assess   such  deficiency  (together  with  all  interest,
      penalties and additions to tax provided for  by  law),  and  notice  and
      demand  shall  be  made  by  the commissioner of finance for the payment
      thereof.
        2. Notice of deficiency. If the jeopardy assessment is made before any
      notice in respect of the tax to which the  jeopardy  assessment  relates
      has  been  mailed  under  section  11-672  of  this subchapter, then the
      commissioner of finance shall mail a notice under  such  section  within
      sixty days after the making of the assessment.
        3.  Amount assessable before decision of the tax appeals tribunal. The
      jeopardy assessment may be made in respect of a  deficiency  greater  or
      less  than that of which notice is mailed to the taxpayer and whether or
      not the taxpayer has theretofore filed a petition with the  tax  appeals
      tribunal.  The  commissioner  of  finance  may,  at  any time before tax
      appeals tribunal renders its decision, abate  such  assessment,  or  any
      unpaid portion thereof, to the extent that the commissioner believes the
      assessment  to  be  excessive in amount. The tax appeals tribunal may in
      its decision redetermine the entire amount of the deficiency and of  all
      amounts assessed at the same time in connection therewith.
        4.  Amounts  assessable after decision of the tax appeals tribunal. If
      the jeopardy assessment is made after the decision of  the  tax  appeals
      tribunal is rendered, such assessment may be made only in respect of the
      deficiency determined by the tax appeals tribunal in its decision.
        5.  Expiration  of  right  to assess. A jeopardy assessment may not be
      made after the decision of the tax appeals tribunal has become final  or
      after the taxpayer has made an application for review of the decision of
      the tax appeals tribunal.
        6.  Collection  of unpaid amounts. When a petition has been filed with
      the tax appeals tribunal and when the  amount  which  should  have  been
      assessed  has  been determined by a decision of the tax appeals tribunal
      which has become final, then any unpaid portion, the collection of which
      has been stayed by bond, shall be collected as  part  of  the  tax  upon
      notice  and  demand  from the commissioner of finance, and any remaining
      portion of the  assessment  shall  be  abated.  If  the  amount  already
      collected  exceeds the amount determined as the amount which should have
      been assessed, such excess shall be credited or refunded to the taxpayer
      as provided in section 11-677 of this subchapter without the  filing  of
      claim  therefor.    If  the amount determined as the amount which should
      have been assessed is greater than the amount  actually  assessed,  then
      the  difference  shall be assessed and shall be collected as part of the
      tax upon notice and demand from the tax appeals tribunal.
        7. Abatement if jeopardy does not exist. The commissioner  of  finance
      may  abate  the  jeopardy  assessment  if  the  commissioner  finds that
      jeopardy does not exist. Such abatement may not be made after a decision
      of the tax appeals tribunal  in  respect  of  the  deficiency  has  been
      rendered  or,  if  no  petition  is filed with the tax appeals tribunal,
      after the expiration of the period for filing such petition. The  period
      of  limitation on the making of assessments and levy or a proceeding for
      collection, in respect of any deficiency, shall be determined as if  the
      jeopardy assessment so abated had not been made, except that the running
      of  such  period shall in any event be suspended for the period from the
      date of such jeopardy assessment until the expiration of the  tenth  day
      after the day on which such jeopardy assessment is abated.
    
        8.  Bond to stay collection. The collection of the whole or any amount
      of any jeopardy assessment may be stayed by filing with the commissioner
      of finance, within such time as may be fixed by regulation, a bond in an
      amount equal to the amount as to which the stay is desired,  conditioned
      upon  the  payment  of  the  amount (together with interest thereon) the
      collection of which is stayed at the time of which, but for  the  making
      of the jeopardy assessment, such amount would be due. Upon the filing of
      the  bond the collection of so much of the amount assessed as is covered
      by the bond shall be stayed. The taxpayer shall have the right to  waive
      such  stay at any time in respect of the whole or any part of the amount
      covered by the bond, and if as a result of such waiver any part  of  the
      amount  covered  by the bond is paid, then the bond shall at the request
      of the taxpayer, be proportionately  reduced.  If  any  portion  of  the
      jeopardy  assessment  is  abated,  or  if  a  notice of deficiency under
      section 11-672 of this subchapter is mailed to the taxpayer in a  lesser
      amount,   the   bond   shall,   at  the  request  of  the  taxpayer,  be
      proportionately reduced.
        9. Petition to tax appeals tribunal. If the bond is given  before  the
      taxpayer has filed its petition under section 11-680 of this subchapter,
      the  bond  shall  contain  a further condition that if a petition is not
      filed within the period provided in such section, then the  amount,  the
      collection  of  which  is stayed by the bond, will be paid on notice and
      demand at any time after the expiration of such  period,  together  with
      interest  thereon from the date of the jeopardy notice and demand to the
      date of notice and demand under this  subdivision.  The  bond  shall  be
      conditioned  upon  the payment of so much of such assessment (collection
      of which is stayed by the bond) as is not abated by a  decision  of  the
      tax appeals tribunal which has become final. If the tax appeals tribunal
      determines  that  the  amount  assessed is greater than the amount which
      should have been assessed, then the bond shall, at the  request  of  the
      taxpayer,  be  proportionately  reduced  when  the  decision  of the tax
      appeals tribunal is rendered.
        10. Stay of sale of seized property  pending  tax  appeals  tribunal's
      decision.  Where  a jeopardy assessment is made, the property seized for
      the collection of the tax shall not be sold:
        (a) if subdivision two is applicable, prior to  the  issuance  of  the
      notice  of deficiency and the expiration of the time provided in section
      11-680 of this subchapter for filing a petition  with  the  tax  appeals
      tribunal, and
        (b)  if  a  petition  is  filed with the tax appeals tribunal (whether
      before or after the making of such jeopardy assessment),  prior  to  the
      expiration  of  the period during which the assessment of the deficiency
      would be prohibited if subdivision one were not applicable.
        Such property may be sold if the taxpayer consents to the sale, or  if
      the commissioner of finance determines that the expenses of conservation
      and maintenance will greatly reduce the net proceeds, or if the property
      is perishable.
        11.  Interest. For the purpose of subdivision one of section 11-675 of
      this  subchapter,  the  last  date  prescribed  for  payment  shall   be
      determined  without  regard  to any notice and demand for payment issued
      under this section prior to the last date otherwise prescribed for  such
      payment.
        12.  Early termination of taxable year. If the commissioner of finance
      finds that a taxpayer designs quickly to remove its property  from  this
      state,  or  to  conceal  its  property  therein,  or to do any other act
      tending  to  prejudice  or  to  render  wholly  or  partly   ineffectual
      proceedings  to collect the tax for the current or the preceding taxable
      year unless such proceedings be brought without delay, the  commissioner
    
      of   finance   shall  declare  the  taxable  period  for  such  taxpayer
      immediately terminated, and shall  cause  notice  of  such  finding  and
      declaration  to  be  given  the  taxpayer,  together  with  a demand for
      immediate  payment  of  the  tax  for  the  taxable  period  so declared
      terminated and of the tax for the preceding taxable year so much of such
      tax as is unpaid, whether or not the time otherwise allowed by  law  for
      filing  return  and  paying  the  tax  has expired; and such taxes shall
      thereupon become immediately due and payable. In any proceeding  brought
      to  enforce  payment  of  taxes  made  due  and payable by virtue of the
      provisions of this subdivision,  the  finding  of  the  commissioner  of
      finance  made  as  herein  provided,  whether  made  after notice to the
      taxpayer or not, shall be  for  all  purposes  presumptive  evidence  of
      jeopardy.
        13.  Reopening  of  taxable period. Notwithstanding the termination of
      the taxable period of the taxpayer by the commissioner  of  finance,  as
      provided  in  subdivision twelve, the commissioner of finance may reopen
      such taxable period each time the taxpayer is found by the  commissioner
      of  finance  to  have  received income, within the current taxable year,
      since the termination of such period. A taxable period so terminated  by
      the  commissioner of finance may be reopened by the taxpayer if it files
      with the commissioner of finance a true and accurate return under any of
      the named subchapters for such taxable period, together with such  other
      information as the commissioner of finance may by regulations prescribe.
        14.   Furnishing   of  bond  where  taxable  year  is  closed  by  the
      commissioner of finance. Payment of taxes shall not be enforced  by  any
      proceedings  under  the  provisions  of  subdivision twelve prior to the
      expiration of the time otherwise allowed for paying such  taxes  if  the
      taxpayer  furnishes, under regulations prescribed by the commissioner of
      finance, a bond to insure the timely making of returns with respect  to,
      and payment of, such taxes or any taxes for prior years.

Section 11-687 ::    
        
     
        ยง  11-687  General  powers of the commissioner of finance. 1. General.
      The commissioner of finance shall administer and enforce the tax imposed
      by the named subchapters and the commissioner is authorized to make such
      rules and regulations, and to require such facts and information  to  be
      reported,  as  the  commissioner  may  deem  necessary  to  enforce  the
      provisions of this subchapter and of  the  named  subchapters;  and  the
      commissioner  may delegate the commissioner's powers and functions under
      all subchapters of this chapter to one of the commissioner's deputies or
      to any employee or employees of his or her department.
        2. Examination of books and witnesses. The  commissioner  of  finance,
      for  the  purpose  of ascertaining the correctness of any return, or for
      the purpose of making an estimate of tax liability of  any  corporation,
      shall  have  power to examine or to cause to have examined, by any agent
      or representative designated by the commissioner for that  purpose,  any
      books, papers, records or memoranda bearing upon the matters required to
      be  included  in  the  return,  and  may  require  the attendance of the
      corporation rendering the return through any officer or employee of such
      corporation, or the attendance of any other person having  knowledge  in
      the  premises, and may take testimony and require proof material for the
      commissioner's information, with  power  to  administer  oaths  to  such
      person or persons.
        3.   Abatement   authority.   The  commissioner  of  finance,  of  the
      commissioner's own motion, may abate any  small  unpaid  balance  of  an
      assessment  of  tax,  or  any  liability  in  respect  thereof,  if  the
      commissioner of finance determines under uniform rules prescribed by the
      commissioner that the administration and collection costs involved would
      not warrant collection of the amount  due.  The  commissioner  may  also
      abate, of his or her own motion, the unpaid portion of the assessment of
      any  tax  or  any  liability  in  respect thereof, which is excessive in
      amount, or is assessed after the expiration of the period of  limitation
      properly applicable thereto, or is erroneously or illegally assessed. No
      claim for abatement under this subdivision shall be filed by a taxpayer.
        4.  Special  refund  authority.  Where no questions of fact or law are
      involved and it appears from the records of the commissioner of  finance
      that  any  moneys  have been erroneously or illegally collected from any
      taxpayer or other person, or paid by such taxpayer or other person under
      a mistake of facts, pursuant to the provisions of this subchapter or any
      of the named  subchapters,  the  commissioner  of  finance  at  anytime,
      without  regard to any period of limitations, shall have the power, upon
      making a record of his or her reasons therefor in writing, to cause such
      moneys so paid and being erroneously and illegally held to be refunded.
        5. (a) Authority to set interest rates. The  commissioner  of  finance
      shall  set the overpayment and underpayment rates of interest to be paid
      pursuant to sections 11-606, 11-608, 11-645, 11-647, 11-675, 11-676, and
      11-679 of this chapter, but if no such rate or  rates  of  interest  are
      set,  such overpayment rate shall be deemed to be set at six percent per
      annum and such underpayment rate shall be deemed to be set at seven  and
      one-half  percent  per  annum.  Such  overpayment and underpayment rates
      shall be the rates prescribed in paragraph (b) of this  subdivision  but
      the  underpayment rate shall not be less than seven and one-half percent
      per annum. Any such rates set by the commissioner of finance shall apply
      to taxes, or any portion thereof, which remain or become due or overpaid
      on or after the date on which such  rates  become  effective  and  shall
      apply  only  with respect to interest computed or computable for periods
      or portions of periods occurring in the period during which  such  rates
      are in effect.
        (b) General rule. (A) Overpayment rate. The overpayment rate set under
      this  subdivision shall be the sum of (i) the federal short-term rate as
    
      provided  under  paragraph  (c)  of  this  subdivision,  plus  (ii)  two
      percentage points.
        (B)   Underpayment   rate.   The  underpayment  rate  set  under  this
      subdivision shall be the sum of  (i)  the  federal  short-term  rate  as
      provided  under  paragraph  (c)  of  this  subdivision,  plus (ii) seven
      percentage points.
        (c) Federal short-term rate. For purposes of this subdivision:
        (A) The federal short-term rate for any month  shall  be  the  federal
      short-term  rate  determined  by  the  United  States  secretary  of the
      treasury during such month in accordance with subsection (d) of  section
      twelve  hundred  seventy-four  of  the  internal revenue code for use in
      connection with section six  thousand  six  hundred  twenty-one  of  the
      internal  revenue  code.  Any  such rate shall be rounded to the nearest
      full percent (or, if a multiple of one-half of one  percent,  such  rate
      shall be increased to the next highest full percent).
        (B) Period during which rate applies.
        (i)   In   general.   Except  as  provided  in  clause  (ii)  of  this
      subparagraph, the federal short-term rate for the first  month  in  each
      calendar quarter shall apply during the first calendar quarter beginning
      after such month.
        (ii)  Special  rule  for  the  month  of  September,  nineteen hundred
      eighty-nine. The  federal  short-term  rate  for  the  month  of  April,
      nineteen  hundred  eighty-nine  shall  apply with respect to setting the
      overpayment and underpayment rates for the month of September,  nineteen
      hundred eighty-nine.
        (d)  Publication  of interest rates. The commissioner of finance shall
      cause to be published in the city record,  and  give  other  appropriate
      general  notice  of, the interest rates to be set under this subdivision
      no later than twenty days  preceding  the  first  day  of  the  calendar
      quarter  during  which  such  interest  rates  apply.  The  setting  and
      publication  of  such  interest  rates  shall  not  be  included  within
      paragraph  (a)  of subdivision five of section one thousand forty-one of
      the city charter relating to the definition of a rule.
        (e) Cross-reference. For provisions  relating  to  the  power  of  the
      commissioner  of  finance  to  abate  small  amounts  of  interest,  see
      subdivision three of this section.
        6. In computing the amount of any interest required to be  paid  under
      this  subchapter  or any of the named subchapters by the commissioner of
      finance or by the taxpayer, or any other amount determined by  reference
      to  such  amount  of  interest,  such  interest and such amount shall be
      compounded daily. The preceding sentence shall not apply for purposes of
      computing the amount of any addition to tax for failure to pay estimated
      tax under subdivision three of section 11-676 of this subchapter.

      Except in accordance with proper judicial order or as otherwise provided
      by law, it shall be  unlawful  for  the  commissioner  of  finance,  the
      department  of  finance  of  the  city,  any  officer or employee of the
      department of finance  of  the  city,  the  tax  appeals  tribunal,  any
      commissioner  or  employee of such tribunal, any person who, pursuant to
      this section, is permitted to inspect any report or return, or  to  whom
      any  information  contained  in  any  report or return is furnished, any
      person engaged or retained by such department on an independent contract
      basis, or any person who in any manner  may  acquire  knowledge  of  the
      contents  of a report filed pursuant to this chapter, to divulge or make
      known in any manner the amount of income or any particulars set forth or
      disclosed in any report or return,  under  this  chapter.  The  officers
      charged  with  the  custody  of  such  reports  and returns shall not be
      required to produce any of them or evidence  of  anything  contained  in
      them  in  any action or proceeding in any court, except on behalf of the
      city in an action or proceeding involving the collection of  a  tax  due
      under  this  chapter  to  which the city is a party or a claimant, or on
      behalf of any party to any action or proceeding under the provisions  of
      this  chapter  when  the  reports,  returns  or  facts shown thereby are

      be  construed  to  prohibit  the  delivery  to  a  taxpayer  or its duly
      authorized representative of a copy of any report filed by  it,  nor  to
      prohibit  the  publication of statistics so classified as to prevent the
      identification of particular reports or returns and the  items  thereof,
      or   the   inspection   by   the  corporation  counsel  or  other  legal
      representatives of the city of the report  or  return  of  any  taxpayer
      which  shall  bring action to set aside or review the tax based thereon,
      or against which an action or proceeding under this chapter or under any
      local law of the city imposed as authorized by the act  authorizing  the
      adoption  of  this  chapter  has been recommended by the commissioner of
      finance or the corporation  counsel  or  has  been  instituted,  or  the
      inspection  of  the  reports  or  returns  of  any  taxpayer by the duly
      designated officers or employees of the city for purposes  of  an  audit
      under  this  chapter  or  an audit authorized by the act authorizing the
      adoption of this chapter; and nothing  in  this  subchapter  or  chapter
      eleven  of  this title shall be construed to prohibit the publication of
      the issuer's allocation percentage, as defined in  subparagraph  one  of
      paragraph (b) of subdivision three of section 11-604 of this chapter, of
      any  corporation  which  may be required to be allocated within the city
      for purposes of the tax imposed by  any  of  the  named  subchapters  or
      chapter eleven of this title.
        2.  (a)  Any  officer  or  employee of the state or city who willfully
      violates the provisions of subdivision one  of  this  section  shall  be
      dismissed  from  office and be incapable of holding any public office in
      the city or this state for a period of five years thereafter.
        (b) Cross-reference: For criminal penalties, see chapter forty of this
      title.
        3. Notwithstanding any provisions of this section, the commissioner of
      finance may permit the secretary of the treasury of the United States or
      his or her delegates, or the proper officer of this or any  other  state
      charged  with  tax  administration,  or the authorized representative of
      either such officer, to inspect the returns or reports filed  under  any
      of  the  named subchapters, or may furnish to such officer or his or her
      authorized representative an abstract of any such return  or  report  or
    
      supply  information  concerning  an item contained in any such return or
      report, or supply  him  or  her  with  information  concerning  an  item
      contained in any such return or report, or disclosed by an investigation
      of tax liability under any of the named subchapters, but such permission
      shall be granted or such information furnished to such officer or his or
      her  representative  only  if  the  laws of the United States or of such
      state, as the case may be, grant substantially similar privileges to the
      commissioner of finance and such information  is  to  be  used  for  tax
      purposes  only;  and  provided  further  the commissioner of finance may
      furnish to the secretary of the treasury of the United States or his  or
      her  delegates  or to the tax commission of the state of New York or its
      delegates  such  returns  or  reports  filed  under  any  of  the  named
      subchapters and other tax information, as he or she may consider proper,
      for  use in court actions or proceedings under the internal revenue code
      or the tax law of the state of New  York,  whether  civil  or  criminal,
      where  a  written  request therefor has been made to the commissioner of
      finance by the secretary of the treasury or by such tax commission or by
      their delegates, provided the laws of the United States or the  laws  of
      the  state  of  New  York  grant  substantially  similar  powers  to the
      secretary of the treasury or  his  or  her  delegates  or  to  such  tax
      commission  or  its  delegates. Where the commissioner of finance has so
      authorized use of returns, reports or other information in such  actions
      or  proceedings, officers and employees of the department of finance may
      testify in such actions or  proceedings  in  respect  to  such  returns,
      reports of other information.
        4.  Notwithstanding the provisions of subdivision one of this section,
      the commissioner of finance, in his or her discretion,  may  require  or
      permit  any or all persons liable for any tax imposed by this chapter to
      make payments on account of  estimated  tax  and  payment  of  any  tax,
      penalty  or interest imposed by this chapter to banks, banking houses or
      trust companies designated by the commissioner of finance  and  to  file
      declarations  of estimated tax, applications for automatic extensions of
      time to file reports, and reports with such  banks,  banking  houses  or
      trust  companies  as  agents  of the commissioner of finance, in lieu of
      making any  such  payment  directly  to  the  commissioner  of  finance.
      However,  the  commissioner  of finance shall designate only such banks,
      banking houses or trust  companies  as  are  depositories  or  financial
      agents of the city.
        5.  This  section  shall  be  deemed  a  state statute for purposes of
      paragraph (a) of subdivision two of section eighty-seven of  the  public
      officers law.
        6.  Notwithstanding anything in subdivision one of this section to the
      contrary, if a taxpayer has petitioned  the  tax  appeals  tribunal  for
      administrative  review as provided in section one hundred seventy of the
      charter, the commissioner of finance shall be authorized to  present  to
      the  tribunal  any report or return of such taxpayer, or any information
      contained therein or relating thereto, which may be material or relevant
      to the proceeding before the tribunal. The tax appeals tribunal shall be
      authorized to publish a copy or  a  summary  of  any  decision  rendered
      pursuant to section one hundred seventy-one of the charter.
        7.  Notwithstanding  anything  in subdivision one of this section, the
      commissioner of finance may disclose  to  a  taxpayer  or  a  taxpayer's
      related  member,  as  defined  in  paragraph (n) of subdivision eight of
