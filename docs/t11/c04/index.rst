        §  11-401.1 Procedures for distressed property. a. The commissioner of
      finance shall, not less than sixty days preceding the date of  the  sale
      of  a  tax  lien  or  tax  liens,  submit to the commissioner of housing
      preservation and development a description by block and lot, or by  such
      other   identification   as   the   commissioner  of  finance  may  deem
      appropriate, of any parcel of class one or class two  real  property  on
      which  there  is  a  tax  lien  that  may be foreclosed by the city. The
      commissioner of housing preservation and  development  shall  determine,
      and direct the commissioner of finance, not less than ten days preceding
      the date of the sale of a tax lien or tax liens, whether any such parcel
      is  a  distressed  property  as  defined  in subdivision four of section

      distressed  property  shall  not be included in such sale. In connection
      with a subsequent sale of a tax lien or tax liens, the  commissioner  of
      finance  may,  not  less than sixty days preceding the date of the sale,
      resubmit to the commissioner of housing preservation and  development  a
      description  by  block  and  lot, or by such other identification as the

      or class two real property  that  was  previously  determined  to  be  a
      distressed  property  pursuant to this paragraph and on which there is a
      tax lien that may be included in such sale. The commissioner of  housing
      preservation   and   development   shall   determine,   and  direct  the
      commissioner of finance, not less than ten days preceding  the  date  of
      the  sale,  whether  such  parcel  remains a distressed property. If the
      commissioner of housing preservation and development determines that the
      parcel is not a distressed property, then the tax lien on the parcel may
      be included in the sale.
        b. The  commissioner  of  housing  preservation  and  development  may
      periodically  review  whether  a  parcel  of class one or class two real
      property that is subject to subdivision c of this section or subdivision
      j of section 11-412.1 of this chapter remains a distressed property.  If
      the commissioner determines that the parcel is not a distressed property
      as  defined  in subdivision four of section 11-401 of this chapter, then
      the parcel shall not be subject to such subdivisions.
        c. Any parcel so determined to  be  a  distressed  property  shall  be
      subject  to  an  in  rem  foreclosure  action,  or in the case where the
      commissioner of finance does not commence such action  the  commissioner
      of  housing  preservation and development shall evaluate such parcel and
      take such action as he or she  deems  appropriate  under  the  programs,
      existing  at the time of such evaluation, that are designed to encourage
      the rehabilitation and  preservation  of  existing  housing,  and  shall
      monitor  or  cause  to  be  monitored  the  status  of the property. The
      commissioner of housing preservation and  development,  in  his  or  her
      discretion,  shall  cause an inspection to be conducted on any parcel so
      determined to be a distressed property. In addition, the commissioner of
      housing preservation and development shall submit to the council a  list
      of  all  parcels so determined to be a distressed property within thirty
      days from the date such parcels are identified as a distressed property.

Section 11-404 ::    
        
     
        §  11-404  Foreclosure  by  action in rem. a. Whenever it shall appear
      that a tax lien or tax liens has or have  been  due  and  unpaid  for  a

      sale of a tax lien or tax liens prior to such  foreclosure.  A  bill  of
      arrears  or  any  other instrument evidencing such tax lien or tax liens
      shall be evidence of the fact that the tax lien or tax liens represented
      thereby has not or have not been paid to the city or sold by it.
        b. A tax lien on any class one property or any class two property that
      is a residential condominium or residential cooperative, as such classes

      assessment or other legal charge represented thereby became a lien.
    
    
    
    
    
    
    

Section 11-405
--------------

Section 11-405 ::    
        
     
        §  11-405  Preparation and filing of lists of delinquent taxes. a. The
      commissioner of finance from time to time shall prepare a  list,  to  be
      known  as  a  "list of delinquent taxes", of all parcels, or all parcels
      within a particular class or  classes,  that  are  within  a  particular
      borough  or section of a tax map or portion of a section of a tax map of
      the city and on  which  there  are  tax  liens  subject  to  foreclosure
      pursuant  to this chapter, provided, however, that no such portion shall
      be smaller than a block, as defined in subdivision d of  section  11-204
      of  subchapter  one  of chapter two of this title. Every such list shall
      bear a caption containing the in rem action number  of  the  city's  tax
      foreclosure  proceeding,  the  borough  or  the  section of a tax map or
      portion of a section of a tax map, and where the action covers less than
      all parcels in an entire borough or section of a tax map or portion of a
      section of a tax map, the particular class or classes, and shall contain
      a statement of the rate or rates at which interest and penalties will be
      computed for the various liens it includes.
        b. Every such list shall set forth the parcels it includes  separately
      and  number  them serially. For each parcel it shall contain (1) a brief
      description sufficient to identify the parcel, including section,  block
      and  lot  numbers,  and  the street and street number, if any, or in the
      absence of such information the parcel or  tract  identification  number
      shown on a tax map or on a map filed in the county clerk's or register's
      office  and  (2)  a statement of the amounts and dates of all unpaid tax
      liens which are subject to foreclosure under this chapter and  of  those
      which have accrued thereafter.
        c.  (1)  The  commissioner of finance may exclude or thereafter remove
      from such list any parcels (i) as to which  questions  the  commissioner
      deems  meritorious have been raised regarding the validity of the liens,
      (ii) as to which all the taxes and other  charges  which  rendered  said
      parcels  eligible  for  inclusion  in said list have been paid, or (iii)
      which are owned by an entity other than a company organized pursuant  to
      article  XI  of  the  private  housing  finance law with the consent and
      approval of the department of housing preservation and  development  and
      which are not owner-occupied residential buildings of not more than five
      residential  units  and  as  to  which  an agreement has been duly made,
      executed and filed  with  such  commissioner  for  the  payment  of  the
      delinquent  taxes,  assessments  or  other  legal  charges, interest and
      penalties in installments. The first installment shall be paid upon  the
      filing  of  the installment agreement with the commissioner and shall be
      in an amount of not less than fifteen percent of such delinquent  taxes,
      assessments   or  other  legal  charges,  interest  and  penalties.  The
      remaining installments, which  shall  be  twice  the  number  of  unpaid
      quarters  of real estate taxes or the equivalent thereof but which shall
      in no event exceed thirty-two in number, shall be payable  quarterly  on
      the  first  day of July, October, January and April. For the purposes of
      calculating the number of such remaining installments unpaid real estate
      taxes which are, on and after July first, nineteen  hundred  eighty-two,
      due  and  payable on an other than quarterly basis shall be deemed to be
      payable on a quarterly basis.
        (2) The commissioner of finance may also exclude or thereafter  remove
      from  such  list  any  parcels  which  are  owned by a company organized
      pursuant to article XI of the  private  housing  finance  law  with  the
      consent  and  approval  of  the  department  of housing preservation and
      development, and (i) as to  which  an  agreement  has  been  duly  made,
      executed  and  filed  with  said  commissioner  for  the  payment of the
      delinquent taxes, assessments or other legal charges incurred  prior  to
      the  ownership  of  said  parcel  by  said  article  XI company, and the
      interest and penalties thereon, in installments. The  first  installment
    
      thereof  shall be paid upon the filing of the installment agreement with
      the commissioner and shall be in an amount of not less than ten  percent
      of  such  delinquent  taxes,  assessments or other legal charges and the
      interest and penalty thereon. The remaining installments, which shall be
      three  times  the  number of unpaid quarters of real estate taxes or the
      equivalent thereof but which shall in no  event  exceed  forty-eight  in
      number  shall  be  payable quarterly on the first days of July, October,
      January and April. For the purposes of calculating the  number  of  such
      remaining  installments unpaid real estate taxes which are, on and after
      July first, nineteen hundred eighty-two due and payable on an other than
      quarterly basis shall be deemed to be payable on a quarterly basis;  and
      (ii)  as  to  which  an agreement has been duly made, executed and filed
      with said  commissioner,  for  the  payment  of  the  delinquent  taxes,
      assessments  or other legal charges incurred after the ownership of said
      parcel by said article XI company on the same terms as are  provided  in
      paragraph one of this subdivision.
        (3)  The commissioner of finance may also exclude or thereafter remove
      from  such  list  any  parcels  which  are  owner-occupied   residential
      buildings  of  not  more  than  five  residential  units  as to which an
      agreement has been duly made, executed and filed with said  commissioner
      for  the  payment  of  the delinquent taxes, assessments, or other legal
      charges and the interest and penalties  thereon,  in  installments.  The
      first  installment  thereof  shall  be  paid  upon  the  filing  of  the
      installment agreement with the commissioner and shall be  in  an  amount
      not  less than ten percent of such delinquent taxes, assessment or other
      legal charges and  the  interest  and  penalty  thereon.  The  remaining
      installments,  which  shall be three times the number of unpaid quarters
      of real estate taxes or the equivalent thereof but  which  shall  in  no
      event  exceed  forty-eight  in number, shall be payable quarterly on the
      first days  of  July,  October,  January  and  April.  For  purposes  of
      calculating the number of such remaining installments unpaid real estate
      taxes  which  are, on and after July first, nineteen hundred eighty-two,
      due and payable on an other than quarterly basis shall be deemed  to  be
      payable on a quarterly basis.
        (4)  Notwithstanding  paragraph one, two or three of this subdivision,
      with respect to installment agreements duly made, executed and filed  on
      or after the date on which this paragraph takes effect, the commissioner
      of  finance  may  also  exclude  or thereafter remove from such list any
      parcel that is (i) (A) a residential building containing not  more  than
      five  residential  units,  (B)  a  residential  condominium  unit, (C) a
      residential building held in a cooperative  form  of  ownership  or  (D)
      owned by a company organized pursuant to article XI of the state private
      housing  finance  law with the consent and approval of the department of
      housing preservation and development, and (ii) as to which an  agreement
      has  been  duly  made, executed and filed with such commissioner for the
      payment of the delinquent taxes, assessments or other legal charges, and
      the  interest  and  penalties  thereon,  in  installments.   The   first
      installment  thereof  shall  be  paid upon the filing of the installment
      agreement with the commissioner and shall be in an amount equal  to  not
      less  than  ten  percent  of  the total amount of such delinquent taxes,
      assessments or other  legal  charges  and  the  interest  and  penalties
      thereon.  The  remaining  installments,  which  shall be three times the
      number of unpaid  quarters  of  real  estate  taxes  or  the  equivalent
      thereof,  but which shall in no event exceed thirty-two in number, shall
      be payable quarterly on the first days of  July,  October,  January  and
      April.  For  the  purposes  of  calculating the number of such remaining
      installments, unpaid real estate taxes that are due and payable on other
    
      than a quarterly basis shall be deemed to  be  payable  on  a  quarterly
      basis.
        (5)  Notwithstanding  paragraph one, two or three of this subdivision,
      with respect to installment agreements duly made, executed and filed  on
      or after the date on which this paragraph takes effect, the commissioner
      of  finance  may  also  exclude  or thereafter remove from such list any
      parcel of class one or class two real  property,  other  than  a  parcel
      described  in  paragraph  four  of  this  subdivision,  as  to  which an
      agreement has been duly made, executed and filed with such  commissioner
      for  the  payment  of  the  delinquent taxes, assessments or other legal
      charges, and the interest and penalties thereon,  in  installments.  The
      first  installment  thereof  shall  be  paid  upon  the  filing  of  the
      installment agreement with the commissioner and shall be  in  an  amount
      equal  to  not  less  than  fifteen  percent of the total amount of such
      delinquent taxes, assessments or other legal charges  and  the  interest
      and  penalties thereon. The remaining installments, which shall be twice
      the number of unpaid quarters of real estate  taxes  or  the  equivalent
      thereof,  but which shall in no event exceed thirty-two in number, shall
      be payable quarterly on the first days of  July,  October,  January  and
      April.  For  the  purposes  of  calculating the number of such remaining
      installments, unpaid real estate taxes that are due and payable on other
      than a quarterly basis shall be deemed to  be  payable  on  a  quarterly
      basis.
        (6)  Notwithstanding  paragraph one, two or three of this subdivision,
      with respect to installment agreements duly made, executed and filed  on
      or after the date on which this paragraph takes effect, the commissioner
      of  finance  may  also  exclude  or thereafter remove from such list any
      parcel of class three or  class  four  real  property  as  to  which  an
      agreement  has been duly made, executed and filed with such commissioner
      for the payment of the delinquent  taxes,  assessments  or  other  legal
      charges,  and  the  interest and penalties thereon, in installments. The
      first  installment  thereof  shall  be  paid  upon  the  filing  of  the
      installment  agreement  with  the commissioner and shall be in an amount
      equal to not less than fifteen percent  of  the  total  amount  of  such
      delinquent  taxes,  assessments  or other legal charges and the interest
      and penalties thereon. The remaining installments, which shall be  twice
      the  number  of  unpaid  quarters of real estate taxes or the equivalent
      thereof, but which shall in no event exceed twenty in number,  shall  be
      payable quarterly on the first days of July, October, January and April.
      For   the   purposes   of  calculating  the  number  of  such  remaining
      installments, unpaid real estate taxes that are due and payable on other
      than a quarterly basis shall be deemed to  be  payable  on  a  quarterly
      basis.
        (7)  A  parcel  for which any such installment agreement or agreements
      have been filed with the commissioner shall be excluded or removed  from
      the  list  of  delinquent  taxes  before  the commencement of the in rem
      action based upon such list only if the amounts paid  pursuant  to  such
      agreement  exceed the amount required to pay all taxes and charges which
      render said parcel eligible for inclusion in the in rem action and there
      has been no default in such agreement prior to the commencement of  said
      action as to either quarterly installments or current taxes, assessments
      or other legal charges.
        (8)  As  a condition to entering into any agreement under this section
      or section 11-409 of this chapter, the commissioner shall have  received
      from the applicant, an affidavit stating that each tenant located on the
      parcel  has  been  notified by certified mail that an application for an
      installment agreement will be  made  and  that  a  copy  of  a  standard
      agreement  form  has  been  included  with  such notification. Any false
    
      statement in such affidavit shall not be grounds to cancel the agreement
      or affect its validity in any way.
        d.  Two  duplicate  originals thereof, verified by the commissioner of
      finance or a subordinate designated by the commissioner, shall be  filed
      in  the  office  of  the clerk of the county in which the parcels listed
      therein are situated. Such filing shall constitute  and  have  the  same
      force  and  effect  as  the  filing  and  recording in such office of an
      individual and separate notice of pendency of action and as  the  filing
      in  the  supreme  court  in  such  county  of an individual and separate
      complaint by the city as to each  parcel  described  in  said  list,  to
      enforce the payment of the delinquent taxes, assessments or other lawful
      charges which have accumulated and become liens against such parcels.
        e.  Each  county  clerk  with  whom such a list of delinquent taxes is
      filed shall, on the date of said filing, place and  thereafter  maintain
      one duplicate original copy thereof, as separately and permanently bound
      by  the commissioner of finance, adjacent to and together with the block
      index of notices of pendency of action and each county clerk  shall,  on
      the  date  of said filing or as soon thereafter as with due diligence is
      practicable, docket the parcels contained  in  the  list  of  delinquent
      taxes  in said block index of notices of pendency of action, which shall
      constitute due filing, recording and indexing of  the  separate  notices
      constituting  said  list  of  delinquent  taxes  in  lieu  of  any other
      requirement under rule sixty-five hundred eleven of the  civil  practice
      law and rules or otherwise.
        f.  The  commissioner  of  finance  shall  file a copy of each list of
      delinquent taxes, certified as such copy by him or her or a  subordinate
      designated  by  the  commissioner,  in  the  borough  office of the city
      collector in the  borough  in  which  the  parcels  listed  therein  are
      situated and in the office of the corporation counsel.
        g.  The  validity of any proceeding hereunder shall not be affected by
      any omission or error of the commissioner of  finance  in  including  or
      excluding  parcels  from any such list or in the designation of a street
      or street number or by any other similar omission or error.

      finance forthwith shall cause a notice of foreclosure to be published at
      least once a week for six successive  weeks  in  the  City  Record  and,
      subject  to  section ninety-one of the judiciary law, in two newspapers,
      one of which may be a law journal, to be designated by the  commissioner
      of  finance,  which  are  published in and are circulated throughout the
      county in which the affected  property  is  located.  If  there  are  no
      newspapers  published  in  such  county, the commissioner of finance may
      designate newspapers published  in  the  city  of  New  York  which  are
      circulated throughout the affected county.
        b.  Such  notice  shall  clearly  indicate  that  it  is  a  notice of
      foreclosure of tax liens; the borough or the section of  a  tax  map  or
      portion  of  a  section  of a tax map in which the properties subject to
      foreclosure are located and  where  the  area  affected  by  the  action
      includes  less than all parcels in an entire borough or section of a tax
      map or portion of a section of  a  tax  map,  the  particular  class  or
      classes  contained  therein, and by a general description which need not
      contain  measurements  and  direction;  where  and  when  the  list   of
      delinquent  taxes  was  filed;  the  general  nature  of the information
      contained  in  the  list;  that  the  filing  of  the  list  constitutes
      commencement  of  a  foreclosure action by the city in the supreme court
      for the particular county and a notice of  pendency  of  action  against
      each parcel listed; that such action is against the property only and no
      personal  judgment  will be entered; that the list will be available for
      inspection at the city collector's central office  and  at  the  borough
      office  of  the  city collector in the borough in which said property is
      located until a specified date at least ten  weeks  after  the  date  of
      first  publication;  that  until  such  date a parcel may be redeemed by
      paying all taxes and charges contained in said list of delinquent  taxes
      together with interest and penalties thereon; that during said period of
      redemption  and  for an additional period of twenty days after said last
      date for redemption any person having any interest in  or  lien  upon  a
      parcel  on the list may file with the appropriate county clerk and serve
      upon the corporation counsel a verified answer setting forth  in  detail
      the  full  name of said answering party, the nature and amount of his or
      her interest or lien and any legal defense against foreclosure; and that
      in the absence of redemption or answer a judgment of foreclosure may  be
      taken by default.
        c.  On or before the date of the first publication of such notice, the
      commissioner of finance shall cause a copy of the notice to be mailed to
      all owners, mortgagees, lienors or encumbrancers, who may be entitled to
      receive such notice by virtue of any owner's registration or in rem card
      filed in the office of the city collector pursuant to section 11-416  or
      11-417  of  this  chapter.  If such owner's registration or in rem cards
      have not been filed in the office of the city collector then said notice
      shall be mailed to the name and address, if any, appearing in the latest
      annual record of assessed valuations. The commissioner of finance  shall
      cause  to  be inserted with such notice a statement substantially in the
      following form:
        "To the party to whom the enclosed notice is addressed:  You  are  the
      presumptive  owner or lienor of one or more of the parcels mentioned and
      described in the list referred to in the  attached  notice.  Unless  the
      taxes and assessments and all other legal charges are paid, or an answer
      is  interposed;  or an arrangement is made for payment of such taxes and
      assessments and all other legal charges in installments, as provided  by
      statute,  the  ownership of said property will in due course pass to the
    
      city of New York as provided by the administrative code of the  city  of
      New York."
        The  failure  of the commissioner of finance to mail such notice shall
      not affect the validity of  any  proceeding  brought  pursuant  to  this
      chapter  as  to  any  parcel other than the parcel with respect to which
      notice was not mailed.
        d. The commissioner of finance shall cause a copy of such notice to be
      posted in the office of the  commissioner  of  finance,  in  the  county
      courthouse  of the county in which the property subject to such tax lien
      is situated and at three other conspicuous  places  in  the  borough  in
      which the affected properties are located.

Section 11-407 ::    
        
     
        § 11-407 Redemption. a. After the filing of a list of delinquent taxes
      and  until  a date at least ten weeks after the first publication of the
      public notice of foreclosure,  as  determined  by  the  commissioner  of
      finance  and  specified in the said notice, a person claiming to have an
      interest in any parcel in said list may redeem it by  paying  all  taxes
      and  charges  contained  in  said list of delinquent taxes together with
      interest and penalties thereon.
        b. Upon such redemption the commissioner of finance shall  deliver  to
      the  corporation  counsel  a  certificate of redemption. The corporation
      counsel shall file such certificate with the  clerk  of  the  county  in
      which  said  list  was  filed.  The  filing  of  such  certificate shall
      constitute and be deemed a discontinuance of the in rem action as to the
      affected  parcel,  and  the  county  clerk  shall  thereupon  note  such
      redemption  and  discontinuance  in  the  copy of the list of delinquent
      taxes maintained by him or her adjacent  to  the  county  clerk's  block
      index  of  notices  of pendency of action and shall cancel and discharge
      any notations of the filing of said list of delinquent taxes as to  said
      parcel  that may appear in any other books, records, indices and dockets
      maintained in said clerk's office. The  commissioner  of  finance  shall
      also  deliver  a  duplicate  original  certificate  of redemption to the
      person who has redeemed.
        c. When the time to redeem in an in rem  tax  foreclosure  action  has
      expired, any person claiming to have an interest in a parcel included in
      said  action  shall  have the right to make a late redemption payment to
      the commissioner of finance. Such late redemption payment shall  consist
      of  all  taxes  and  charges  owing  on said parcel, the lawful interest
      thereon to the date of payment and a penalty of  five  percent  of  said
      payment of taxes, charges and interest, which penalty may not exceed one
      thousand dollars as to each parcel on which a late redemption payment is
      being  made.  Such  late  redemption payment shall be made in cash or by
      certified or bank check and shall be accepted  by  the  commissioner  of
      finance at any time after the last day to redeem up to the date on which
      the  commissioner  is  advised  by  the  corporation  counsel  that  the
      preparation of the judgment of foreclosure in the in rem action has been
      commenced.  Upon  receipt  of  such   late   redemption   payment,   the
      commissioner of finance shall issue a certificate of withdrawal pursuant
      to the provisions of section 11-413 of this chapter.
    
    
    
    
    
    
    

Section 11-408

Section 11-408 ::    
        
     
        §  11-408 Filing of affidavits. All affidavits of filing, publication,
      posting, mailing or other acts required by this chapter shall be made by
      the person or persons performing such acts and shall  be  filed  in  the
      office  of  the county clerk of the county in which the property subject
      to such tax lien is situated and shall together with all other documents
      required by this chapter to be filed in the office of such county clerk,
      constitute and become a part of the judgment roll  in  such  foreclosure
      action.
    
    
    
    
    
    
    

Section 11-409
--------------

Section 11-409 ::    
        
     
        §  11-409  Severance  and  trial of issues where answer is interposed;
      installment agreements authorized after action commenced. a. If  a  duly
      verified  answer  is  served upon the corporation counsel not later than
      twenty days after the last date for redemption, the answering  defendant
      shall  have  the right to a severance of the action, as to any parcel in
      which the  defendant  has  pleaded  an  interest,  upon  written  demand
      therefor filed with or made a part of his or her answer.
        b.  When such answer is interposed, the court shall summarily hear and
      determine the issues raised by the complaint  and  answer  in  the  same
      manner  as  it  hears  and  determines  other  actions, except as herein
      otherwise provided. Proof  that  the  taxes  which  made  said  property
      subject  to  foreclosure  hereunder together with interest and penalties
      thereon, were paid before filing of the list of delinquent taxes or that
      the property was not subject to tax shall constitute a complete defense.
        c. No counterclaim may be asserted  in  an  answer  interposed  in  an
      action  brought  pursuant  to  this  chapter.  Where  a  counterclaim is
      asserted in an in rem answer the city may disregard that portion of  the
      answer   and  shall  suffer  no  legal  penalty  or  impediment  in  the
      prosecution of its in rem action for its failure  to  reply  or  respond
      thereto.  Where  an  answer  contains  only  a counterclaim and no other
      defenses the city may proceed to judgment  of  foreclosure  against  the
      property affected without the need for moving against the answer.
        d. When a verified answer alleges a substantial equity over the city's
      lien for taxes, the defendant may demand additional time in which to pay
      the  taxes  and interest or to have the property sold with all taxes and
      interest to be paid out of the proceeds of such sale. Upon such demand a
      defendant shall have the right to an extension of time for such  purpose
      not  in  excess  of six months from the last day to interpose an answer.
      Where a mortgagee or lienor who has interposed such answer  commences  a
      proceeding  to foreclose his or her mortgage or lien and it appears that
      with due diligence such proceeding cannot be concluded in time to  allow
      the  payment  of  taxes within the aforesaid six month period, the court
      may, on application before the end of said six month  period,  authorize
      an  additional  period during which such proceeding may be concluded and
      the taxes, together with interest and penalties, paid.
        e. Where an answer of the type described  in  subdivision  d  of  this
      section  is interposed and taxes are paid within the period set forth in
      such  subdivision  d,  the  commissioner  of  finance  shall   issue   a
      certificate  of  withdrawal as to the property on which such payment has
      been made pursuant to the provisions of section 11-413 of this  chapter.
      When  taxes are not paid within the period set forth in such subdivision
      d, it shall be deemed that there was no equity over the city's tax liens
      and the answer shall be deemed to be without merit.  The  city  in  that
      event  may  proceed  to  judgment  of  foreclosure against such property
      without moving against the answer.
        f. All answers interposed in an action hereunder  and  all  affidavits
      and  other papers pertaining to any litigation involving such answers or
      to any proceeding brought pursuant to this chapter involving  less  than
      an  entire  action  shall  bear  a  caption containing the in rem action
      number of the city's tax foreclosure  proceeding,  the  borough  or  the
      section  of a tax map or portion of a section of a tax map affected, and
      if the action covers less than all  parcels  in  an  entire  borough  or
      section  of  a  tax  map  or  portion  of  a  section  of a tax map, the
      particular class or classes, and the  serial,  section,  block  and  lot
      numbers of the parcel or parcels in issue.
        g.  The  corporation  counsel, when submitting an in rem judgment roll
      pursuant to the provisions of this chapter, may request a  severance  as
      to  any parcel on which an in rem answer or litigation is pending, or as
    
      to which, before the  preparation  of  said  in  rem  judgment  roll  is
      commenced,  an  agreement  was  duly  made,  executed and filed with the
      commissioner of  finance  for  the  payment  of  the  delinquent  taxes,
      assessments  or  other  legal  charges  and  interest  and  penalties in
      installments as provided in subdivision c  of  section  11-405  of  this
      chapter  and  there  has  been no default in such agreement as to either
      quarterly installments or current  taxes,  assessments  or  other  legal
      charges.  Where such an agreement is entered into subsequent to the last
      date for redemption specified in subdivision a of section 11-407 of this
      chapter, there shall be paid to the commissioner of finance at the  time
      the aforesaid agreement is executed an amount equal to the penalty which
      would  have  been  payable under subdivision c of section 11-407 of this
      chapter had the person executing the agreement made  a  late  redemption
      payment.  Such  amount  shall be in addition to any installment payments
      required to be made under  the  agreement  and  shall  not  be  credited
      against  any  such  installment payments. Where a default occurs in such
      agreement  as  to  either  quarterly  installments  or  current   taxes,
      assessments  or  other  legal  charges,  all  payments  made  under  the
      agreement shall be forfeited and the city shall be entitled  to  acquire
      the  parcel  as to which the default occurred. Where such default occurs
      before the submission of the judgment roll, the parcels as to which such
      default occurs shall be included in said judgment roll among the parcels
      to be acquired by the city. Where such default  has  occurred  as  to  a
      parcel  severed  pursuant  to  this subdivision, the corporation counsel
      shall cause to be entered a supplemental judgment of foreclosure  as  to
      such  parcel  immediately on notification by the commissioner of finance
      of such default. Where such installment agreement is paid  in  full  the
      commissioner  of  finance shall discontinue the in rem action from which
      said parcel was severed by issuing a certificate  of  withdrawal  as  to
      said  parcel  pursuant  to  the  provisions  of  section  11-413 of this
      chapter.
        h. A party who has interposed an answer as to any parcel  included  in
      an  in rem tax foreclosure action, or any other party interested in such
      parcel, shall have the right, at any time prior to the final disposition
      of a motion to strike said answer, to pay  all  taxes,  assessments  and
      other  legal  charges  and  interest  owing on said parcel. An answering
      party who makes such payment shall not be required to pay  any  penalty.
      Where  such  payment  is made by other than an answering party after the
      expiration of the period of redemption,  there  shall  be  paid  to  the
      commissioner  of  finance  an  additional  amount  equal  to the penalty
      payable under subdivision c of section 11-407 of this chapter. Where all
      delinquent taxes, assessments and  other  legal  charges  together  with
      lawful  interest  thereon  and  penalties, where required, are paid, the
      commissioner of finance shall issue a certificate of  withdrawal  as  to
      said  parcel  pursuant  to  the  provisions  of  section  11-413 of this
      chapter. Said parties may also pay such  taxes,  assessments  and  other
      legal  charges  and  interest  by  an  installment agreement. Where such
      agreement is requested before the preparation of the  aforesaid  in  rem
      judgment  roll  is  commenced,  the  terms  of  said  agreement shall be
      consistent with the provisions of subdivision g or i  of  this  section,
      whichever  is  applicable.  Where  such  agreement  is  requested  after
      judgment of foreclosure has been entered in the in rem action  in  which
      the  aforesaid  answer  was  interposed,  said agreement shall require a
      first installment of fifty percent of all taxes, assessments  and  other
      legal  charges  and  interest  owing  on  said parcel, a penalty of five
      percent of all such taxes,  assessments  and  other  legal  charges  and
      interest,  which  penalty  may  not exceed one thousand dollars, and the
      payment of the balance  of  such  taxes,  assessments  and  other  legal
    
      charges  and interest in four equal quarterly installments together with
      all current taxes, assessments  and  other  legal  charges  that  accrue
      during such period. The request of an answering party for an installment
      agreement  shall  constitute  a  withdrawal  of  such party's answer. An
      installment agreement requested by an interested party  other  than  the
      answering  party shall require the consent of said answering party which
      shall also constitute a withdrawal of such party's answer. The severance
      provided for in this section shall be continued during the term  of  all
      installment  agreements  entered into pursuant to the provisions of this
      subdivision. Where a  default  has  occurred  as  to  a  parcel  severed
      pursuant  to this subdivision, the corporation counsel shall cause to be
      entered a  supplemental  judgment  of  foreclosure  as  to  such  parcel
      immediately  on  notification  by  the  commissioner  of finance of such
      default.  Where  such  installment  agreement  is  paid  in  full,   the
      commissioner  of  finance shall discontinue the in rem action from which
      said parcel was severed by issuing a certificate  of  withdrawal  as  to
      said  parcel  pursuant  to  the  provisions  of  section  11-413 of this
      chapter.
        i. (1) Notwithstanding subdivision g of this section, this subdivision
      shall apply with respect to installment agreements  made,  executed  and
      filed  with  the  commissioner  of finance on or after the date on which
      this subdivision takes effect. An installment agreement pursuant to this
      subdivision may be made,  executed  and  filed  with  such  commissioner
      during  the period beginning on the date on which an action is commenced
      as provided in subdivision d of section  11-405  of  this  chapter  with
      respect  to  the parcel that is the subject of such agreement and ending
      on the date on which such commissioner is  advised  by  the  corporation
      counsel  that  the preparation of the judgment of foreclosure in such in
      rem action has been commenced. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary,
      and except to the extent provided in paragraph two of this  subdivision,
      the provisions of paragraphs one through six of subdivision c of section
      11-405  of  this  chapter  shall  not apply to any installment agreement
      requested on or after the date on which this  subdivision  takes  effect
      and  on or after the date on which an action is commenced as provided in
      subdivision d of such section 11-405 with respect to the parcel that  is
      the subject of such requested agreement.
        (2)  An  agreement  entered  into  pursuant  to this subdivision shall
      provide for  the  payment  in  installments  of  the  delinquent  taxes,
      assessments  and  other  legal  charges,  and the interest and penalties
      thereon, due and owing as  of  the  date  on  which  such  agreement  is
      requested.  Unless an eligible owner or other interested person requests
      an agreement pursuant to the  provisions  of  paragraph  three  of  this
      subdivision,  the terms of such agreement with respect to a parcel shall
      be the same as the terms that would be applicable to such  parcel  under
      paragraph  four,  five  or  six, as the case may be, of subdivision c of
      section 11-405 of  this  chapter,  except  that,  for  purposes  of  the
      agreement   pursuant   to  this  paragraph,  the  amount  of  the  first
      installment shall be equal to: (i) fifteen percent of the  total  amount
      due  in  the  case  of  a  parcel described in such paragraph four; (ii)
      twenty percent of the total amount due in the case of a parcel described
      in such paragraph five; and  (iii)  twenty-five  percent  of  the  total
      amount due in the case of a parcel described in such paragraph six.
        (3)  Instead  of  an  agreement  pursuant  to  paragraph  two  of this
      subdivision, an eligible owner or other interested party may request  an
      agreement pursuant to the following provisions:
        (i)  With  respect  to  a  parcel that is owned by a company organized
      pursuant to article XI of the state private housing finance law with the
      consent and approval of  the  department  of  housing  preservation  and
    
      development,   such   agreement   shall   provide  for  the  payment  in
      installments of  the  delinquent  taxes,  assessments  and  other  legal
      charges, and the interest and penalties thereon, due and owing as of the
      date on which such agreement is requested. The first installment thereof
      shall  be  paid  upon  the  filing of the installment agreement with the
      commissioner of finance and shall be in an amount at least equal to,  at
      the applicant's election, either thirty-five percent or fifty percent of
      the  total  amount  of such delinquent taxes, assessments or other legal
      charges  and  the  interest  and  penalties   thereon.   The   remaining
      installments,  which  shall be three times the number of unpaid quarters
      of real estate taxes or the equivalent thereof, but which  shall  in  no
      event  exceed  thirty-two  in  number, shall be payable quarterly on the
      first days of July, October, January and April, together  with  interest
      at the rate or rates determined as provided in subparagraph (iv) of this
      paragraph.  For the purposes of calculating the number of such remaining
      installments, unpaid real estate taxes that are due and payable on other
      than a quarterly basis shall be deemed to  be  payable  on  a  quarterly
      basis.
        (ii)  With  respect  to  a  parcel,  other  than a parcel described in
      subparagraph (i) of this  paragraph,  that  is  a  residential  building
      containing   not   more  than  five  residential  units,  a  residential
      condominium unit or a residential building held in a cooperative form of
      ownership, such agreement shall provide for the payment in  installments
      of  the  delinquent  taxes, assessments and other legal charges, and the
      interest and penalties thereon, due and owing as of the  date  on  which
      such agreement is requested. The first installment thereof shall be paid
      upon  the  filing  of the installment agreement with the commissioner of
      finance and shall be in an amount at least equal to, at the  applicant's
      election,  either  twenty-five  percent  or  fifty  percent of the total
      amount of such delinquent taxes, assessments or other legal charges  and
      the  interest  and  penalties thereon. The remaining installments, which
      shall be three times the number of unpaid quarters of real estate  taxes
      or  the equivalent thereof, but which shall in no event exceed twenty in
      number, shall be payable quarterly on the first days of  July,  October,
      January and April together with interest at the rate or rates determined
      as  provided in subparagraph (iv) of this paragraph. For the purposes of
      calculating the number  of  such  remaining  installments,  unpaid  real
      estate  taxes  that  are due and payable on other than a quarterly basis
      shall be deemed to be payable on a quarterly basis.
        (iii) With respect to any parcel  of  class  one  or  class  two  real
      property,  other  than a parcel described in subparagraph (i) or (ii) of
      this  paragraph,  such  agreement  shall  provide  for  the  payment  in
      installments  of  the  delinquent  taxes,  assessments  and  other legal
      charges, and the interest and penalties thereon, due and owing as of the
      date on which such agreement is requested. The first installment thereof
      shall be paid upon the filing of  the  installment  agreement  with  the
      commissioner  of finance and shall be in an amount at least equal to, at
      the applicant's election, either thirty-five percent or fifty percent of
      the total amount of such delinquent taxes, assessments  or  other  legal
      charges   and   the   interest  and  penalties  thereon.  The  remaining
      installments, which shall be twice the number of unpaid quarters of real
      estate taxes or the equivalent thereof, but  which  shall  in  no  event
      exceed twenty in number, shall be payable quarterly on the first days of
      July,  October, January and April, together with interest at the rate or
      rates determined as provided in subparagraph (iv) of this paragraph. For
      the purposes of calculating the number of such  remaining  installments,
      unpaid  real  estate  taxes  that  are  due  and payable on other than a
      quarterly basis shall be deemed to be payable on a quarterly basis.
    
        (iv) (A)  Notwithstanding  any  higher  rate  of  interest  prescribed
      pursuant  to  applicable  law,  and  unless  a lower rate of interest is
      applicable to a delinquent amount owing on a parcel that is the  subject
      of  an  agreement  pursuant  to  this  paragraph,  the  interest payable
      together  with the remaining installments due under such agreement shall
      be:
        (I) with respect to an agreement for which a  twenty-five  percent  or
      thirty-five percent down payment was made, calculated at a rate equal to
      the sum of (a) the rate prescribed for the applicable period pursuant to
      paragraph (i) of subdivision e of section 11-224.1 of this title and (b)
      one-half of the difference between such rate and the rate prescribed for
      such  period  pursuant  to  paragraph  (ii)  of subdivision e of section
      11-224.1 of this title; or
        (II) with respect to an agreement  for  which  a  fifty  percent  down
      payment  was made, calculated at a rate equal to the rate prescribed for
      the applicable period pursuant to paragraph  (i)  of  subdivision  e  of
      section 11-224.1 of this title.
        (B)  If  a  default  occurs in any agreement executed pursuant to this
      paragraph  as  to  either  quarterly  installments  or  current   taxes,
      assessments  or  other  legal  charges, the rates of interest determined
      under this subparagraph shall thereupon cease to be applicable  and  the
      commissioner  of  finance  shall  thereafter charge, collect and receive
      interest in the manner and at the rates otherwise prescribed pursuant to
      law.
        (4) The corporation counsel, when submitting an in rem  judgment  roll
      pursuant  to  the provisions of this chapter, may request a severance as
      to any parcel as to  which,  before  the  preparation  of  said  in  rem
      judgment  roll  is  commenced,  an agreement was duly made, executed and
      filed with the commissioner of finance for the payment of all delinquent
      taxes, assessments and other legal charges and interest and penalties in
      installments as provided in this subdivision,  and  there  has  been  no
      default in such agreement as to either quarterly installments or current
      taxes,  assessments  or  other legal charges. Where such an agreement is
      entered into subsequent to the last date  for  redemption  specified  in
      subdivision  a of section 11-407 of this chapter, there shall be paid to
      the commissioner of finance at the time such agreements are executed  an
      amount  equal  to  the  penalty  that  would  have  been  payable  under
      subdivision c of section 11-407 of this chapter had the person executing
      the agreement made a late redemption payment. Such amount  shall  be  in
      addition  to  any  installment  payments  required  to be made under the
      agreement and  shall  not  be  credited  against  any  such  installment
      payments.  Where  a  default  occurs  in  such  agreement  as  to either
      quarterly installments or current  taxes,  assessments  or  other  legal
      charges,  all  payments  made under the agreement shall be forfeited and
      the city shall be entitled to obtain a  judgment  hereunder  as  to  the
      parcel  as  to  which  the default occurred. Where such default occurred
      before the submission of the judgment roll, the parcels as to which such
      default occurs shall be  included  in  said  judgment  roll  amount  the
      parcels  to  be  acquired  by  the  city or by a third party. Where such
      default  has  occurred  as  to  a  parcel  severed  pursuant   to   this
      subdivision,  the  corporation  counsel  shall  cause  to  be  entered a
      supplemental judgment of foreclosure as to such  parcel  immediately  on
      notification  by the commissioner of finance of such default. Where such
      installment agreement is paid in full, the commissioner of finance shall
      discontinue the in rem action from which  such  parcel  was  severed  by
      issuing  a  certificate  of withdrawal as to such parcel pursuant to the
      provisions of section 11-413 of this chapter.
    
    
    
    
    
    
    

Section 11-410

Section 11-410 ::    
        
     
        § 11-410 Preference over other actions. a. Any action brought pursuant
      to  this  chapter  shall  be  given preference over all other causes and
      actions.
        b. Actions brought pursuant to this chapter shall take precedence over
      any proceeding brought to foreclose a mortgage or other  lien  involving
      the same property. A parcel included in a list of delinquent taxes which
      is sold in a mortgage foreclosure sale held after said list is filed may
      not  be  sold subject to taxes even if judgment has not yet been entered
      in the tax  foreclosure  action.  All  unpaid  taxes  and  interest  and
      penalties  thereon  must  be  paid,  in full or by installment agreement
      pursuant to the provisions of this chapter, out of the proceeds of  such
      sale  regardless  of  whether  the  mortgage foreclosure lis pendens was
      filed before  or  after  the  filing  of  the  tax  foreclosure  action,
      regardless  of  whether any party to the mortgage foreclosure proceeding
      has interposed an answer in the tax foreclosure action and regardless of
      any terms to the contrary in the judgment in  the  mortgage  foreclosure
      proceeding.

--------------

Section 11-411 ::    
        
     
        §  11-411  Presumption  of validity. It shall not be necessary for the
      city to plead or prove the various steps, procedures and notices for the
      assessment and levy of the taxes, assessments or  other  lawful  charges
      against  the  parcels  set forth in the list of delinquent taxes and all
      such taxes, assessments or other lawful charges  and  the  lien  thereof
      shall  be  presumed to be valid. A defendant alleging any jurisdictional
      defect or invalidity in such taxes, assessments or other lawful  charges
      or  in  the  foreclosure thereof must particularly specify in his or her
      answer such jurisdictional defect or invalidity and  must  affirmatively
      establish  such  defense.  A  judgment  of  foreclosure  granted  in any
      proceeding brought pursuant to this  chapter,  which  contains  recitals
      that  any acts were done or proceedings had which were necessary to give
      the court jurisdiction or power to grant such judgment  of  foreclosure,
      shall  be  presumptive  evidence  that  such acts were duly performed or
      proceedings duly had, if such judgment of foreclosure  shall  have  been
      duly  entered or filed in the office of the clerk of the county in which
      the proceeding was pending and wherein such judgment  was  granted.  The
      provisions  of  this  chapter  shall apply to and be valid and effective
      with respect to all defendants even  though  one  or  more  of  them  be
      infants,  incompetents,  absentees  or non-residents of the state of New
      York.
    
    
    
    
    
    
    

Section 11-412
--------------

Section 11-412 ::    
        
     
        §  11-412   Final judgment.   a.  The court shall determine upon proof
      and shall make finding upon  such  proof  whether  there  has  been  due
      compliance by the city with the provisions of this chapter.
        b.  The  court  shall  make  a final judgment awarding to the city the
      possession of any parcel described in the list of delinquent  taxes  not
      redeemed  or  withdrawn  as  provided in this chapter and as to which no
      answer is interposed as  provided  herein.  In  addition  thereto,  such
      judgment  shall  contain  a  direction to the commissioner of finance to
      prepare, execute and cause to be recorded a deed conveying to  the  city
      full  and complete title to such lands. Upon the execution of such deed,
      the city shall be seized of an estate in fee  simple  absolute  in  such
      land  and  all  persons,  including  the  state  of  New  York, infants,
      incompetents, absentees and non-residents who may have  had  any  right,
      title,  interest,  claim,  lien  or equity of redemption in or upon such
      lands shall be barred and forever foreclosed of all such  right,  title,
      interest,  claim,  lien  or  equity  of  redemption, except as otherwise
      provided in section 11-424 of this chapter. The appointment  and  tenure
      of  receivers,  trustees  or any other persons, including administrators
      under article seven-A of the real property actions and proceedings  law,
      appointed  by  an  order  of  a  court  to  manage  real property, shall
      terminate when title to such property vests in the city pursuant to  the
      provisions  of  this  chapter.  After  such termination, said receivers,
      trustees or administrators shall  be  accountable  to  the  courts  that
      appointed   them   for  the  faithful  performance  of  their  fiduciary
      obligations during the term of their appointment and to the city for any
      rents and income received by them for any period subsequent to the  date
      of the vesting of title in the city.
        If  the  city  serves  a  tenant in possession of a dwelling unit with
      notice of termination of tenancy on grounds other  than  non-payment  of
      rent,  the  acceptance  of  rent  for  the  first  forty-five days after
      termination  of  tenancy  by  anyone  other  than  an  employee  of  the
      department  designated  by the department to receive such rent shall not
      be deemed or construed as a waiver of the city's right to  initiate  and
      prosecute a proceeding to terminate the tenancy for good cause.
        c.   Every deed given pursuant to the provisions of this section shall
      be presumptive evidence that the action and all proceedings therein  and
      all  proceedings  prior thereto from and including the assessment of the
      lands affected and all notices required  by  law  were  regular  and  in
      accordance with all provisions of law relating thereto.  After two years
      from  the  date  of the recording of such deed, the presumption shall be
      conclusive, unless at the time that this subdivision  takes  effect  the
      two year period since the recording of the deed has expired or less than
      six  months of such period of two years remains unexpired, in which case
      the  presumption  shall  become  conclusive  six   months   after   this
      subdivision  takes  effect.    No  action  to set aside such deed may be
      maintained unless the action is commenced and a notice  of  pendency  of
      the  action  is  filed in the office of the proper county clerk prior to
      the time that the presumption becomes conclusive as aforesaid.

Section 11-412.1 ::    
        
     
        §  11-412.1  Special procedures relating to final judgment and release
      of class one and class two  real  property.  Notwithstanding  any  other
      provision of law to the contrary:
        a.  The court shall determine upon proof and shall make a finding upon
      such proof whether there has been due compliance by the  city  with  the
      applicable provisions of this chapter.
        b.  (1) The court shall make a final judgment authorizing the award of
      possession of any parcel  of  class  one  or  class  two  real  property
      described  in  the list of delinquent taxes not redeemed or withdrawn as
      provided in this chapter and as to which  no  answer  is  interposed  as
      provided herein, and authorizing the commissioner of finance to prepare,
      execute  and cause to be recorded a deed conveying either to the city or
      to a third party deemed qualified and designated by the commissioner  of
      housing  preservation  and  development  full and complete title to such
      lands. Any such conveyance to a third party shall  be  for  an  existing
      use.
        (2) Such third party shall be deemed qualified and shall be designated
      pursuant to such criteria as are established in rules promulgated by the
      commissioner of housing preservation and development, provided, however,
      that  such  criteria  shall  include  but not be limited to: residential
      management experience;  financial  ability;  rehabilitation  experience;
      ability   to   work   with   government   and  community  organizations;
      neighborhood ties; and that the commissioner shall consider whether  the
      third  party  is a responsible legal tenant, not-for-profit organization
      or  neighborhood-based-for-profit  individual   or   organization.   The
      commissioner  shall  not  deem  qualified  any  third party who has been
      finally adjudicated by a court of competent jurisdiction,  within  seven
      years  of  the  date on which such third party would otherwise be deemed
      qualified, to have violated any section of articles one  hundred  fifty,
      one  hundred  seventy-five, one hundred seventy-six, one hundred eighty,
      one hundred eighty-five or two hundred of the penal law or  any  similar
      laws of another jurisdiction, or who has been suspended or debarred from
      contracting  with the city or any agency of the city pursuant to section
      335 of the charter during the period of such  suspension  or  debarment.
      The rules promulgated by the commissioner pursuant to this paragraph may
      establish other bases for disqualification of a third party.
        c.  Following  the  expiration  of the four-month period prescribed in
      subdivision d of this section, but not more than eight months after  the
      date  on  which,  pursuant  to  subdivision b of this section, the final
      judgment authorizing the award of possession of a parcel of class one or
      class two real property was entered, the  commissioner  of  finance  may
      execute  a deed, pursuant to subdivision b of this section, with respect
      to such parcel. The owner of said parcel shall continue to have  all  of
      the  rights, liabilities, responsibilities, duties and obligations of an
      owner of such parcel, including, but not limited  to,  maintaining  such
      parcel  in  compliance  with  the housing maintenance, building and fire
      codes, and all other applicable laws, unless and until the  commissioner
      of  finance has prepared and executed a deed conveying to the city or to
      a third party full and complete title to such parcel. Upon the execution
      of such deed, the city or the third party shall be seized of  an  estate
      in fee simple absolute in such land and all persons, including the state
      of  New York, infants, incompetents, absentees and non-residents who may
      have had any right, title, interest, claim, lien or equity of redemption
      in or upon such lands shall be barred and forever foreclosed of all such
      right, title, interest, claim, lien or equity of redemption,  except  as
      otherwise  provided  in  subdivisions  e  and  f  of  this  section. The
      appointment and tenure of receivers,  trustees  or  any  other  persons,
      including  administrators  under  article  seven-A  of the real property
    
      actions and proceedings law, appointed by an order of a court to  manage
      real  property, shall terminate when title to such property vests in the
      city or a third party pursuant to the provisions of this chapter.  After
      such  termination,  said  receivers, trustees or administrators shall be
      accountable  to  the  courts  that  appointed  them  for  the   faithful
      performance  of  their  fiduciary  obligations  during the term of their
      appointment and to the city or such third party for any rents and income
      received by them for any period subsequent to the date of the vesting of
      title in the city or such third party.
        If the city serves a tenant in possession  of  a  dwelling  unit  with
      notice  of  termination  of  tenancy on grounds other than nonpayment of
      rent, the acceptance  of  rent  for  the  first  forty-five  days  after
      termination  of  tenancy  by  anyone  other  than  an  employee  of  the
      department designated by the department to receive such rent  shall  not
      be  deemed  or construed as a waiver of the city's right to initiate and
      prosecute a proceeding to terminate the tenancy for good cause.
        d. Within four months after the date on which, pursuant to subdivision
      b  of  this  section,  the  final  judgment  authorizing  the  award  of
      possession  of  a  parcel  of  class  one or class two real property was
      entered, any person claiming to have an interest in  such  parcel  shall
      have  the  right  to  make  a  payment  to  the  commissioner of finance
      consisting of all taxes, assessments and other legal  charges  owing  on
      said  parcel,  the  lawful interest thereon to the date of payment and a
      penalty of five percent of said payment of taxes, assessments and  other
      legal  charges  and  interest, which penalty may not exceed one thousand
      dollars. Such payment shall be made in cash  or  by  certified  or  bank
      check.  Within  such  four-month period, such interested person may also
      request an installment agreement from the commissioner of finance.  Such
      agreement  shall  require,  in  addition  to full payment of the penalty
      specified in this subdivision at the  time  such  agreement  is  entered
      into,  the  payment  at  such time of a first installment equal to fifty
      percent of all taxes, assessments  and  other  legal  charges,  and  the
      lawful  interest  thereon, then owing on such parcel, and the payment of
      the balance of such taxes,  assessments  and  other  legal  charges  and
      interest  in four equal quarterly installments together with all current
      taxes, assessments and other  legal  charges  that  accrue  during  such
      period.  Upon  receipt of payment in full of the amount specified in the
      first sentence of this subdivision, the commissioner  of  finance  shall
      direct  the  corporation  counsel  to prepare and cause to be entered an
      order discontinuing the  in  rem  tax  foreclosure  action  as  to  said
      property,  cancelling  the  notice of pendency of such action as to said
      property and vacating and setting aside the  final  judgment.  Upon  the
      execution  of an installment agreement and payment of the amounts due at
      the time such agreement is executed as provided in this subdivision, the
      commissioner of finance shall direct the corporation counsel to  prepare
      and  cause  to  be entered an order vacating and setting aside the final
      judgment. The entry of either such  order  shall  restore  all  parties,
      including  owners,  mortgagees  and  any  and all lienors, receivers and
      administrators and encumbrancers, to the status  they  held  immediately
      before  such  final  judgment  was  entered.   Where the commissioner of
      finance approves an  application  requesting  an  installment  agreement
      pursuant  to  this subdivision, the order vacating and setting aside the
      final judgment shall provide that in the event of any default as to  the
      payment  of  either quarterly installments or current taxes, assessments
      or other legal charges during the term of such agreement,  all  payments
      under  said  agreement  shall  be forfeited and the corporation counsel,
      immediately upon notification by the commissioner  of  finance  of  such
      default,  shall  cause  to be entered as to such property a supplemental
    
      judgment of foreclosure in  the  in  rem  action  which  authorizes  the
      commissioner  of  finance to prepare, execute and cause to be recorded a
      deed conveying either to the city or to a third party full and  complete
      title  to  such lands. Upon the entry of such supplemental judgment, the
      provisions of subdivisions c through i of this section  shall  apply  in
      the  same  manner as such subdivisions would have applied had no payment
      been made nor  installment  agreement  executed  during  the  four-month
      period specified in this subdivision.
        e. 1. If the commissioner of finance has prepared, executed and caused
      to be recorded a deed conveying to the city full and complete title to a
      parcel  of  class  one or class two real property acquired by in rem tax
      foreclosure, the city's interest in such parcel may be released pursuant
      to this subdivision on the application of any party who has an  interest
      in  said  parcel  as either owner, mortgagee, lienor, or encumbrancer at
      the time of the city's acquisition thereof  where  such  application  is
      made at any time up to sixteen months from the date on which the deed by
      which the city acquired title to said parcel was recorded.
        2.  Any  such application shall be made in writing to the commissioner
      of general  services  and  shall  be  verified.  It  shall  contain  the
      information  required  pursuant  to  paragraph  one  of subdivision b of
      section 11-424 of this chapter, the documents required by subdivision  c
      of  such  section,  and  shall  be  accompanied  by the fees required by
      paragraphs three and six of subdivision  b  of  such  section.  The  fee
      required  by  paragraph three of subdivision b of section 11-424 of this
      chapter shall not be refundable.
        3. The city's interest in any such parcel shall be released only after
      payment of the sums of money  specified  in  subdivision  d  of  section
      11-424 of this chapter.
        4. The provisions contained in subdivision g of section 11-424 of this
      chapter shall govern such an application, except as follows:
        (a)  where  such  provisions  are  inconsistent  with  the  provisions
      contained  in  this  subdivision,  the  provisions  contained  in   this
      subdivision shall govern such application; and
        (b)  where  the  in  rem  foreclosure  release  board denies a written
      request for an installment agreement that was filed in  connection  with
      an  application  for release of the city's interest in a parcel of class
      one or class two real property and such  application  was  filed  within
      thirty days of the date of the city's acquisition of the property sought
      to be released, the board may, in its discretion, authorize a release of
      the city's interest, provided that the applicant thereafter pays all the
      amounts  required to be paid pursuant to subdivision d of section 11-424
      of this chapter within thirty  days  of  the  date  on  which  a  letter
      requesting such payment is mailed or delivered to such applicant.
        5.  Upon  receipt  of  all the amounts required to be paid pursuant to
      this  subdivision,  the  commissioner  of  finance  shall   direct   the
      corporation  counsel  to  prepare  and  cause  to  be  entered  an order
      discontinuing the in rem tax foreclosure action  as  to  said  property,
      cancelling the notice of pendency of such action as to said property and
      vacating  and  setting  aside  the  final  judgment  entered pursuant to
      subdivision b of  this  section  and  the  deed  executed  and  recorded
      pursuant  to  such final judgment as to said property. The entry of such
      order shall restore all parties, including owners,  mortgagees  and  any
      and  all lienors, receivers and administrators and encumbrancers, to the
      status they held immediately before the final judgment was  entered,  as
      if  the  in  rem tax foreclosure had never taken place, and shall render
      said property liable for all taxes, deficiencies,  management  fees  and
      liens which shall accrue subsequent to those paid in order to obtain the
    
      release  provided  for  in this subdivision, or which were, for whatever
      reason, omitted from the payment made to obtain said release.
        f. If the commissioner of finance has prepared, executed and caused to
      be  recorded  a  deed conveying to the city full and complete title to a
      parcel of class one or class two real property acquired by  in  rem  tax
      foreclosure and such parcel is entitled to an exemption under any of the
      provisions  of  article  four of the real property tax law during all or
      part of the period covered by the tax  items  appearing  on  a  list  of
      delinquent  taxes,  the  owner of such parcel may apply for a release of
      the city's interest in such exempt  property  under  the  provisions  of
      subdivision  e  of  this  section during the period of time set forth in
      paragraph one of such subdivision and for an additional period up to ten
      years from the date on which the deed by which the city  acquired  title
      to  said  property  was recorded. The application of such owner shall be
      accompanied by the nonrefundable  fee  required  by  paragraph  four  of
      subdivision  b  of  section 11-424 of this chapter and shall contain, in
      addition to the statements, searches and proofs required by  subdivision
      e of this section, a statement that an exemption under the real property
      tax  law is being claimed. Such application shall also state either that
      it is accompanied by the written certificate of the comptroller  setting
      forth the precise period during which said property, while owned by such
      application,  and  during  the period after the city's acquisition up to
      the date of the certificate if said property was still being used for an
      exempt purpose after said acquisition, was entitled to an exemption  and
      the exact nature and extent of such exemption or that an application for
      such written certificate has been filed with the comptroller. On issuing
      such  written  certificate, the comptroller shall cancel those tax items
      which have accrued during the period covered by the certificate  to  the
      extent  the  applicant  is  entitled to an exemption as set forth in the
      certificate. A release of the city's interest may be authorized only  at
      the  discretion  of  the in rem foreclosure release board and, except as
      otherwise provided in paragraph four of subdivision e of  this  section,
      subject  to  all  the restrictions set forth in subdivision g of section
      11-424 of this chapter. A  release  to  an  exempt  applicant  shall  be
      effected  only after said applicant has paid all of the amounts required

      for  those  tax  items  which  have  been canceled, in whole or in part,
      pursuant to the comptroller's certificate, within  thirty  days  of  the
      date  on  which  the letter requesting payment is mailed or delivered to
      the applicant.
        g. If the commissioner of finance has prepared, executed and caused to
      be recorded a deed conveying to the city or to a third  party  full  and
      complete  title  to  a  parcel  of  class one or class two real property
      acquired  by  in  rem  tax  foreclosure,  the  provisions  contained  in
      subdivisions  f  and i of section 11-424 of this chapter for the release
      of property so acquired shall not be available. If the  commissioner  of
      finance  has  prepared,  executed  and  caused  to  be  recorded  a deed
      conveying to a third party full and complete title to a parcel of  class
      one  or  class two real property acquired by in rem tax foreclosure, the
      provisions contained in subdivisions e and f of  this  section  for  the
      release of property so acquired shall not be available.
        h.  Every  deed given pursuant to the provisions of this section shall
      be presumptive evidence that the action and all proceedings therein  and
      all  proceedings  prior thereto from and including the assessment of the
      lands affected and all notices required  by  law  were  regular  and  in
      accordance  with  all  provisions  of  law  relating thereto. After four
      months from the date of entry of  the  final  judgment  authorizing  the
      award  of  possession  of  any  parcel  of  class  one or class two real
    
      property pursuant to the provisions of  this  section,  the  presumption
      shall  be conclusive. No action to set aside such deed may be maintained
      unless the action is commenced and a notice of pendency of the action is
      filed  in the office of the property county clerk prior to the time that
      the presumption becomes conclusive as aforesaid. Should any  lawsuit  or
      proceeding be commenced to set aside a deed conveying to a third party a
      parcel  of  class  one  or  class  two  real  property  pursuant  to the
      provisions  of  this  section,  such  third  party  shall  send  to  the
      corporation  counsel  within  ten  days  of  their receipt a copy of any
      papers served on such third party in such lawsuit or proceeding.
        i. If the commissioner of finance does not execute a deed conveying to
      the city or to a third party a parcel of class one  or  class  two  real
      property   within  eight  months  after  the  entry  of  final  judgment
      authorizing  the  award  of  possession  of  such  parcel  pursuant   to
      subdivision  b of this section, the commissioner of finance shall direct
      the corporation counsel to prepare and cause  to  be  entered  an  order
      discontinuing  the  in  rem  foreclosure  action  as  to  said property,
      canceling the notice of pendency of such action as to said property  and
      vacating  and setting aside said final judgment. The entry of such order
      shall restore all parties, including owners, mortgagees and any and  all
      lienors,  receivers  and administrators and encumbrancers, to the status
      they held immediately before such final judgment was entered.
        j. If the commissioner of finance  directs  the  corporation  counsel,
      pursuant  to  subdivision  i of this section, to prepare and cause to be
      entered an order  discontinuing  the  in  rem  foreclosure  action  with
      respect  to  a parcel of class one or class two real property determined
      to be distressed pursuant to  section  11-401.1  of  this  chapter,  the
      commissioner  of housing preservation and development shall evaluate the
      parcel determined to be distressed and take such action  as  he  or  she
      deems  appropriate  under  the  programs,  existing  at the time of such
      evaluation, that  are  designed  to  encourage  the  rehabilitation  and
      preservation  of  existing  housing,  and  shall  monitor or cause to be
      monitored the status  of  the  property.  The  commissioner  of  housing
      preservation  and  development  shall  maintain a register of properties
      determined to be distressed.

Section 11-413 ::    
        
     
        §  11-413  Withdrawal of parcels from foreclosure. a. The commissioner
      of finance may, prior to  final  judgment,  withdraw  a  parcel  from  a
      proceeding  under  this  chapter for any of the following reasons, (1) a
      question which the commissioner deems meritorious has been raised as  to
      the  validity  of  the  tax  liens  affecting  the  parcel, (2) the city
      collector has accepted  a  payment  of  all  taxes  and  interest  which
      rendered the parcel subject to foreclosure hereunder because the records
      in the commissioner's office indicated that the principal amount of such
      taxes  was  exceeded  by  the principal amount of subsequent taxes which
      would not have rendered the parcel subject to foreclosure hereunder  and
      which  had been paid prior to the commencement of said proceeding or (3)
      in cases where the tax foreclosure action cannot be maintained such  as,
      but  not  limited  thereto,  where  the  charges which rendered a parcel
      subject to foreclosure hereunder have been cancelled or were paid before
      the commencement of the foreclosure proceeding but such payment was  not
      reported  or  did  not clear for payment until after the commencement of
      said proceeding, or where a name and address  appearing  on  an  owner's
      registration  card or an in rem card filed pursuant to section 11-416 or
      11-417 of this chapter and contained in the files of the city  collector
      did  not  appear in the mailing list used by the commissioner of finance
      for mailing notices of foreclosure in such proceeding.
        b. To effectuate such withdrawal the  commissioner  of  finance  shall
      deliver a certificate of withdrawal to the corporation counsel who shall
      file  it  in  the  office  of  the  county  clerk  in  which the list of
      delinquent taxes was filed. The filing of  such  certificate  with  such
      county clerk shall effect a discontinuance of the tax foreclosure action
      as  to  the  affected  parcel, and the county clerk shall thereupon note
      such withdrawal and discontinuance in the copy of the list of delinquent
      taxes maintained by him or her adjacent  to  the  county  clerk's  block
      index  of  notices  of pendency of action and shall cancel and discharge
      any and all notations of the filing of said list of delinquent taxes  as
      to  said parcel that may appear in any other books, records, indices and
      dockets maintained in said clerk's office.
        c. The commissioner of finance shall also deliver a duplicate original
      certificate of withdrawal to the person entitled to such withdrawal.
        d. The commissioner of finance shall recite the parcels  so  withdrawn
      and  the  reasons  for  withdrawal  in  an affidavit of regularity to be
      submitted by the commissioner in each action brought  pursuant  to  this
      chapter.
        e. The commissioner of finance shall issue a certificate of withdrawal
      whenever taxes and interest are paid, cancelled, liquidated or otherwise
      lawfully  disposed  of  as  to  any  parcel which was previously severed
      pursuant to  section  11-409  of  this  chapter  because  an  answer  or

      either  owner,  mortgagee,  lienor  or  encumbrancer  at the time of the
      city's acquisition thereof where such application is made at any time up
      to two years from the date on which the deed by which the city  acquired
      title to said property was recorded.
        (2)  Notwithstanding  any  inconsistent  provision of paragraph one of
      this subdivision to  the  contrary,  the  city's  interest  in  property

      of the city's acquisition thereof where such application  is  made  more
      than  two  years  after  the  date  on  which the deed by which the city
      acquired title to said property was recorded provided  such  application
      is authorized by the council as hereinafter provided. An application for
      such  release  and  the  documents  required by subdivision c in support

      also state the applicant's  relationship  to  said  decedent  and  shall
      include  whatever  additional  information may be necessary to prove the
      applicant's right to make such application.
        2. A fee of two hundred seventy-five dollars  shall  be  paid  on  the

      of  subdivision  d of this section; provided, however, that if a release
      requires the authorization of the in rem foreclosure release board,  and
      such  authorization  is  not  given,  such  additional  amount  shall be
      refunded to the applicant.
        c. Each application shall be supported by the certified search of  the
      city  register or by an official letter, certificate or certified search
      of any title insurance or abstract company, organized and doing business
      under the laws of this state. Such supporting instruments  shall  recite
      the  recording data both as to the deed by which the city acquired title
      to the parcel sought to be released and the instrument  from  which  the
      applicant's interest derives. In the event the applicant's interest does
      not appear of record but is derived by the death of an owner, mortgagee,
      lienor  or  encumbrancer  of  record, then the application shall also be
      supported by the affidavit of  the  applicant  or  other  person  having
      information thereof, or by the duly written certificate or certification
      of  the  county  clerk or the clerk of any surrogate's or other court of
      record,  or  by  any  other  instrument  or  document  required  by  the
      corporation  counsel  to substantiate the applicant's right to file such
      application in compliance with the provisions of this section.
        d. The city's interest shall be released only  after  payment,  as  to
      each parcel to be released, of the following sums of money:
        1.  The  principal  amount due on all unpaid taxes, assessments, water
      charges and sewer rents appearing on the list of  delinquent  taxes  and
      accruing thereafter together with interest at the rate or rates provided
      by law.
        2. Five percent of the amount paid pursuant to the preceding paragraph
      but not exceeding one thousand dollars for each parcel.
        3. Any deficiency which may result to the city after all payments made
      by  it  for  the  repair,  maintenance, and operation of the lands, real
      estate or real property shall  have  been  charged  or  debited  in  the
      appropriate  accounts  of the city and all rents, license fees and other
      moneys collected by the city as a result of its operation  of  the  said
      lands,  real  estate  or  real property shall have been credited in such
      accounts. Any contract for repair, maintenance, management or  operation
      made  by  the city on which it shall be liable, although payment thereon
    
      shall not have been made, shall be deemed a  charge  or  debit  to  such
      accounts as though payment had been made. The amounts paid and collected
      by  the  city  as shown in its accounts and the necessity for making the
      several payments and contracts to be charged as herein provided shall be
      conclusive upon the applicant. Where a deficiency under this subdivision
      shall  be  created  or  increased  by the failure of the city to collect
      rents, license fees or other moneys to which  the  city  may  have  been
      entitled,  the right to collect or to bring action for the same shall be
      assigned, transferred and set over to the applicant by an instrument  in
      writing.
        4.  Any  and all costs and disbursements which shall have been awarded
      to the city or to which it may have become entitled by operation of  law
      or  which  it  may  have paid or become liable for payment in connection
      with any litigation between it and the applicant or any person having an
      estate or interest in the lands, real estate  or  real  property  to  be
      released resulting directly or indirectly from the foreclosure by action
      in rem of the delinquent taxes affecting said lands, real estate or real
      property.
        5.  A reasonable monthly fee to be determined by the city, through the
      department of citywide administrative services, for management  services
      and  operations  of  the lands, real estate or real property by the city
      prior to the release of said lands, real estate or property.
        6.  The  city,  through  the  department  of  citywide  administrative
      services,  shall  also  require  as  additional  consideration  for such
      release, the payment of all arrears on mortgages held by  the  city  and
      all  liens  accruing to it by operation of law including but not limited
      to relocation and emergency repair liens.
        e. The corporation counsel shall effect  the  release  of  the  city's
      interest in property acquired by in rem tax foreclosure, as provided for
      in  this  section,  by  preparing  and  causing  to  be entered an order
      discontinuing the in rem tax forclosure  action  as  to  said  property,
      cancelling the notice of pendency of such action as to said property and
      vacating  and  setting  aside the in rem judgment of foreclosure and the
      deed executed and recorded pursuant to such judgment of  foreclosure  as
      to  said  property.  The  entry of such order shall restore all parties,
      including owners, mortgagees and any  and  all  lienors,  receivers  and
      administrators  and  encumbrancers,  to the status they held at the time
      the city acquired  title  to  said  property,  as  if  the  in  rem  tax
      foreclosure had never taken place, and shall render said property liable
      for  all  taxes,  deficiencies,  management  fees  and liens which shall
      accrue subsequent to those paid in order to obtain the release  provided
      for  in  this  section, or which were, for whatever reason, omitted from
      the payment made to obtain said release.
        f. If an application pursuant  to  this  section,  and  the  documents
      required  by subdivision c of this section in support thereof, are filed
      within four months after the date  of  the  city's  acquisition  of  the
      subject  property,  said  application  shall  be  granted  providing the
      corporation counsel approves the application as to form, timeliness  and
      eligibility  of  the  applicant and providing the applicant has paid all
      amounts required to be paid by subdivision  d  of  this  section  within
      thirty  days  of the date on which a letter requesting applicant to make
      such payment is mailed or delivered to the applicant. The city shall not
      sell or assign any property acquired by in rem  tax  foreclosure  within
      four months of said acquisition but this provision shall not prevent the
      city  from  authorizing  condemnation  of such property or vesting title
      thereto in a condemnation proceeding during said four month  period.  In
      the  event  an application pursuant to this section is filed within four
      months of the city's acquisition by in rem tax foreclosure and title  to
    
      the  subject  property  vests in condemnation before the city's interest
      therein has been released by the vacate order provided for  herein,  the
      applicant  shall be entitled to the condemnation award for such property
      without  the  entry  of  such  vacate  order,  providing the corporation
      counsel has approved the application as aforesaid and providing that the
      amounts specified in subdivision d of this section,  if  not  previously
      paid,  are deducted from said condemnation award, with taxes apportioned
      to the date of the condemnation title vesting.
        g. If an application for a release of the city's interest in  property
      acquired  by  in  rem  tax  foreclosure,  and  the documents required by
      subdivision c of this section in support thereof, have been filed within
      the time allowed in paragraph one of subdivision a of this section,  but
      more  than four months after the date of the city's acquisition or if an
      application for such release has been authorized by a resolution of  the
      council  pursuant  to paragraph two of subdivision a of this section and
      such application and the documents required by  subdivision  c  of  this
      section  in  support  thereof  have  been  filed, the in rem foreclosure
      release board may, in its  discretion,  authorize  the  release  of  the
      city's interest in said property pursuant to this section, provided that
      the application has been approved by the corporation counsel as to form,
      timeliness  and  eligibility of the applicant and provided that the city
      has not sold or  otherwise  disposed  of  said  property  and  provided,
      further,  that  said  property has not been condemned or assigned to any
      agency of the city and is not the subject of contemplated  use  for  any
      capital  or  urban  renewal project of the city. The corporation counsel
      shall effect such discretionary release only where the applicant,  after
      the  board's  authorization  of  the  release,  has paid all the amounts
      required to be paid by subdivision d of this section within thirty  days
      of  the  date  on  which  a letter requesting the applicant to make such
      payment is mailed or delivered to the applicant. The in rem  foreclosure
      release  board  may  also, in its discretion, authorize a release of the
      city's interest in such property,  pursuant  to  the  above  provisions,
      whenever   an  application  for  such  release,  approved  as  to  form,
      timeliness and eligibility by the corporation counsel, has been filed at
      any time during the period allowed in subdivision a of this  section  in
      which  the  applicant  has  requested  an  installment  agreement of the
      commissioner of citywide administrative services for the payment of  the
      amounts  required  to  be paid by subdivision d of this section provided
      that said commissioner has approved such request.  The  commissioner  of
      citywide  administrative  services  shall  not  approve any such request
      unless the applicant shall have given notice by certified mail  to  each
      tenant  located  on the parcel, of the request and shall have given such
      commissioner an affidavit stating that such notice  has  been  provided,
      within  thirty  days  after  the  request.  Any  false statement in such
      affidavit shall not in any way affect the validity of the agreement,  be
      grounds  for  its  cancellation  or in any way affect the release of the
      city's interest in the parcel. Such agreement shall require, in addition
      to full payment of the amounts due under paragraphs  two,  three,  four,
      five  and  six  of subdivision d of this section, a first installment of
      fifty percent of the amount due under paragraph one of said  subdivision
      d  with  the  balance  of said amount to be paid in four equal quarterly
      installments together with all current taxes, assessments or other legal
      charges that accrue during such period;  provided,  however,  that:  (i)
      whenever  a  request  for  an  installment  agreement  is  made  of  the
      commissioner of citywide administrative services by a company  organized
      pursuant  to  article  XI  of  the  private housing finance law with the
      consent and approval of  the  department  of  housing  preservation  and
      development  or  for  a  parcel  which  is an owner-occupied residential
    
      building of not more than five residential units,  the  commissioner  of
      citywide  administrative services may, as to that portion of the amounts
      due under paragraph one of subdivision d of this  section  which  became
      due  prior  to the acquisition by the article XI company of its interest
      in the property and  as  to  the  amount  due  under  paragraph  one  of
      subdivision  d  of  this  section  in the case of such an owner-occupied
      building, approve a reduction of such first installment to an amount not
      less than  ten  percent  of  the  amount  due  under  paragraph  one  of
      subdivision  d  of  this  section  and  an increase in the number of the
      following equal quarterly installments to a number which shall be  equal
      to three times the number of unpaid quarters of real estate taxes or the
      equivalent  thereof  but which shall in no event exceed forty-eight, and
      (ii) notwithstanding  the  preceding  clause,  whenever  an  installment
      agreement  is  requested on or after the date on which this clause takes
      effect with respect to a parcel that, immediately prior  to  the  city's
      acquisition  thereof  by  in rem tax foreclosure, was owned by a company
      organized pursuant to article XI of the state  private  housing  finance
      law  with  the  consent  and  approval  of  the  department  of  housing
      preservation and development, or with respect to  a  parcel  that  is  a
      residential  building containing not more than five residential units, a
      residential condominium  unit  or  a  residential  building  held  in  a
      cooperative form of ownership, the commissioner of general services may,
      as  to  the  amount  due  under  paragraph  one of subdivision d of this
      section, approve an installment agreement containing the terms  relating
      to  the  required  percentage  payment for the first installment and the
      required number of subsequent  quarterly  installments,  that  would  be
      applicable to such parcel under paragraph two (but without regard to any
      reference therein to paragraph three) of subdivision i of section 11-409
      of  this  chapter.  For  purposes  of  calculating  the  number  of such
      following equal quarterly installments, unpaid real estate taxes or  the
      equivalent  which  are,  on  and  after  July  first,  nineteen  hundred
      eighty-two, due and payable on an other than quarterly  basis  shall  be
      deemed  to be payable on a quarterly basis. Where the in rem foreclosure
      release board denies an application requesting an installment  agreement
      the  board  shall  authorize  a release of the city's interest, provided
      that the applicant thereafter pays all the amounts required to  be  paid
      by subdivision d of this section within thirty days of the date on which
      a letter requesting such payment is mailed or delivered to the applicant
      only  when  said application and the documents required by subdivision c
      of this section in support thereof were filed within thirty days of  the
      date  of  the  city's acquisition of the property sought to be released.
      Where the  in  rem  foreclosure  release  board  denies  an  application
      requesting  an  installment  agreement  which was filed more than thirty
      days after the date of the city's acquisition, the  board  may,  in  its
      discretion,  authorize  a  release of the city's interest, provided that
      the applicant thereafter pays all the amounts required  to  be  paid  by
      subdivision  d of this section within thirty days of the date on which a
      letter requesting such payment is mailed or delivered to the  applicant.
      Where  the  in  rem  foreclosure  release  board approves an application
      requesting an installment agreement,  the  order  releasing  the  city's
      interest  shall  provide  that  in  the  event  of any default as to the
      payment of either quarterly installments or current  taxes,  assessments
      or  other  legal charges during the term of such agreement, as set forth
      in the board's resolution, all payments made under said agreement  shall
      be forfeited and the city shall be entitled to reacquire the property so
      released.  The  corporation  counsel  shall effect such reacquisition by
      causing to be entered as to such property  a  supplemental  judgment  of
      foreclosure  in  the in rem action by which said property was originally
    
      acquired immediately on notification by the commissioner of  finance  of
      such default.
        h.  An  owner  of  property  entitled to an exemption under any of the
      provisions of article four of the real property tax law  during  all  or
      part  of  the  period  covered  by  the tax items appearing on a list of
      delinquent taxes may apply for a release of the city's interest in  such
      exempt  property under the provisions of this section during the periods
      of time set forth herein and for an additional period up  to  ten  years
      from  the  date  of  the  city's  acquisition of said property by in rem
      foreclosure. The application of such owner shall contain, in addition to
      the  statements,  searches  and  proofs  required  by  this  section,  a
      statement  that  an  exemption  under the real property tax law is being
      claimed. Such application shall also state either that it is accompanied
      by the written certificate of the comptroller setting forth the  precise
      period  during  which  said property, while owned by such applicant, and
      during the period after the city's acquisition up to  the  date  of  the
      certificate  if said property was still being used for an exempt purpose
      after said acquisition, was entitled  to  an  exemption  and  the  exact
      nature  and  extent  of  such  exemption or that an application for such
      written certificate has been filed with the comptroller. On issuing such
      written certificate, the comptroller shall cancel those tax items  which
      have  accrued during the period covered by the certificate to the extent
      the  applicant  is  entitled  to  an  exemption  as  set  forth  in  the
      certificate.  Where an application by an exempt owner is filed more than
      four months after the date of the  city's  acquisition  of  the  subject
      property,  a  release  of  the city's interest may be issued only at the
      discretion of the in rem foreclosure release board and  subject  to  all
      the restrictions set forth in the preceding subdivision. A release to an
      exempt  applicant  shall  be effected only after said applicant has paid
      all the amounts required to be paid by subdivision d  of  this  section,
      except  for  those  tax  items which have been cancelled, in whole or in
      part, pursuant to the comptroller's certificate, within thirty  days  of
      the  date on which a letter requesting payment is mailed or delivered to
      the applicant.
        i. The corporation counsel shall also effect the release of the city's
      interest in property acquired by in rem foreclosure, as provided for  in
      this action, whenever the commissioner of finance shall accept as to any
      parcel  so  acquired,  the  payment  provided  for  in  paragraph two of
      subdivision a of section 11-413 of this chapter. Said  commissioner  may
      accept  such  payment  at any time within four months of the date of the
      city's acquisition and may further, subject to the approval  of  the  in
      rem foreclosure release board, accept such payment at any time more than
      four  months  after the date of the city's acquisition but less than two
      years from the date on which the city's deed was recorded providing said
      property has not been sold or otherwise disposed  of  nor  condemned  or
      assigned  to  any  agency  of  the  city  and  is  not  the  subject  of
      contemplated use of any capital or urban renewal project of the city.

Section 11-424.1 ::    
        
     
        §  11-424.1 In rem foreclosure release board. There shall be an in rem
      foreclosure release board consisting of the mayor, the  speaker  of  the
      city  council,  the  affected borough president, the corporation counsel
      and the commissioner of finance. For the purposes of this  section,  the
      affected  borough  president  shall  be  the president of the borough in
      which a property proposed  for  release  pursuant  to  this  section  is
      located.  Members  of the board may, by written authority filed with the
      board and with the city clerk, appoint delegates to act on their  behalf
      as  members  of  the  board.  The  board shall have the power, acting by
      resolution, to authorize the release of the city's interest in  property
      acquired  by in rem tax foreclosure in accordance with sections 11-412.1
      and 11-424 of the code based upon a determination,  in  its  discretion,
      that  such release would be in the best interests of the city. The board
      shall act after a meeting at which  the  public  has  been  provided  an
      opportunity to comment on the proposed action. A resolution of the board
      authorizing  a  release  of the city's interest in any property shall be
      adopted only upon the affirmative vote of not less than  a  majority  of
      all  the members of the board. The board may consider any information it
      deems relevant to a determination. The board shall not  be  required  to
      state the reasons for its determination.
    
    
    
    
    
    
    

Section 11-425

Section 11-425 ::    
        
     
        §  11-425  Agreements  for  payment of delinquent taxes and charges in
      installments. a. During the period  beginning  on  May  ninth,  nineteen
      hundred  seventy-seven  and  ending  on June thirtieth, nineteen hundred
      seventy-seven,  the  commissioner  of  finance  or,  when  so  specified
      hereinafter,  the  commissioner of general services, shall be authorized
      and empowered to make and execute agreements in  the  circumstances  and
      subject  to  the  terms,  conditions  and  limitations  set forth in the
      following subdivisions of this section; provided, however, that  if  the
      commissioner  of  finance  or,  where  applicable,  the  commissioner of
      general services determines in his or  her  sole  discretion  that  good
      cause  exists,  he or she may make and execute such agreements during an
      additional period ending not  later  than  July  thirty-first,  nineteen
      hundred seventy-seven.
        b.  (1)  Whenever it shall appear that a tax lien on a parcel has been
      due and unpaid for a period of at least six  months  from  the  date  on
      which  the  tax,  assessment  or  other legal charge represented thereby
      became a lien, the commissioner of finance may enter into  an  agreement
      with  the  owner  of  such  parcel  or  other person claiming to have an
      interest therein providing for the payment  of  such  delinquent  taxes,
      assessments  or  other  legal  charges  and  interest  and  penalties in
      installments, the first of which shall be  equal  to  at  least  fifteen
      percent  of such arrears and shall be payable upon the execution of such
      agreement. Each remaining installment shall be  equal  to  at  least  an
      amount  produced  by  dividing  the  balance of such arrears by a factor
      determined by multiplying the number of quarters of such arrears by  two
      hundred  per cent. In no event, however, shall the factor referred to in
      the preceding sentence be in excess of thirty-two. Each  such  remaining
      installment  shall  be  payable  quarterly  on  the  first days of July,
      October, January and April.
        (2) If an agreement authorized by the preceding paragraph is  executed
      prior to the time the commissioner of finance files in the office of the
      appropriate county clerk a list of delinquent taxes covering the borough
      or  portion  of the borough in which the subject parcel is located, such
      parcel shall be excluded from such list of delinquent  taxes,  provided,
      at the time such list is filed, there is no default in the agreement and
      all  current taxes, assessments or other legal charges have been paid as
      they became due or within the period of grace provided by  law.  In  the
      event  of  any  default  in  the agreement or any failure to make timely
      payment of any current item, the parcel shall, if  then  delinquent  for
      the  applicable  period  specified in section 11-404 of this chapter, be
      eligible for inclusion in any list of delinquent taxes thereafter filed.
        (3) If an in rem foreclosure action has  been  commenced  against  any
      parcel   prior   to  May  ninth,  nineteen  hundred  seventy-seven,  the
      commissioner of finance may, notwithstanding the provisions of paragraph
      three of subdivision a of section 11-413 of this chapter, enter into  an
      agreement  authorized  and described in the foregoing provisions of this
      section with respect to such parcel. However, if such  an  agreement  is
      entered  into  subsequent  to  the last date for redemption specified in
      subdivision a of section 11-407 of this chapter, there shall be paid  to
      the  commissioner  of  finance at the time said agreement is executed an
      amount equal  to  the  penalty  which  would  have  been  payable  under
      subdivision c of section 11-407 of this chapter had the person executing
      the  agreement  made  a late redemption payment. Such amount shall be in
      addition to any installment payments  required  to  be  made  under  the
      agreement  and  shall  not  be  credited  against  any  such installment
      payments. Any parcel which is the subject of an agreement made  pursuant
      to  this  paragraph  may, prior to final judgment, be withdrawn from the
      action, provided there  has  been  no  default  in  the  agreement,  and
    
      provided  further  that  all  current  taxes, assessments or other legal
      charges are paid when they become due or  within  the  period  of  grace
      provided  by  law. Such withdrawal shall be effected by the commissioner
      of finance in the manner provided in section 11-413 of this chapter.
        (4)   Any   person   who,   prior   to  May  ninth,  nineteen  hundred
      seventy-seven, has made, executed and filed  with  the  commissioner  of
      finance  an  agreement  pursuant to the provisions of paragraph three of
      subdivision a of section 11-413 of this chapter, shall be  permitted  to
      make  application  to  the  commissioner  of  finance for the purpose of
      having  such  agreement  cancelled  and  a  new  agreement  executed  as
      hereinabove provided.
        If  an  agreement  executed  prior  to  May  ninth,  nineteen  hundred
      seventy-seven is not cancelled as herein provided, any installments  due
      and  payable  under  such  agreement  on  or  after July first, nineteen
      hundred seventy-seven shall be subject to interest at the rate specified
      in paragraph five of this subdivision, but only if, as  of  July  first,
      nineteen hundred seventy-seven, there is no default in the agreement and
      all  current  taxes,  assessments  or other legal charges have been paid
      within the  time  allowed  by  law.  Such  rate  of  interest  shall  be
      calculated  in  the  manner  and  shall be subject to all the conditions
      provided in said paragraph five.
        (5) When an agreement has been entered into pursuant  to  any  of  the
      preceding  paragraphs  of  this subdivision, the commissioner of finance
      shall, notwithstanding the  rates  of  interest  prescribed  in  section
      11-224,  11-312  or  11-313  of  this title, charge, collect and receive
      interest on the arrears due and payable  under  such  agreement,  to  be
      calculated  at  the  rate  of  seven  percent per annum from July first,
      nineteen  hundred  seventy-seven  to  the  date  of  payment   of   each
      installment.  Any  interest  accrued  or  accruing  prior to July first,
      nineteen hundred seventy-seven shall not be affected by  the  provisions
      of  this  paragraph, but shall be charged, collected and received in the
      manner and at the rates specified in section 11-224, 11-312 or 11-313 of
      this title. The  seven  percent  rate  of  interest  specified  in  this
      paragraph  shall  be  applicable  only if (i) there is no default in the
      agreement entered into as provided in this section, and (ii) all current
      taxes, assessments or other legal charges are paid as they become due or
      within the period of grace provided by law. In the event of any  default
      or failure to make timely payment of any current item, the seven percent
      rate of interest specified in this paragraph shall thereupon cease to be
      applicable  and  the  commissioner  of  finance shall thereafter charge,
      collect and receive interest in the manner and at  the  rates  otherwise
      specified in this title.
        (6)  In addition to the terms and conditions required by the preceding
      paragraphs of this subdivision to be included in  agreements  authorized
      by  this  section,  the  commissioner  of  finance  may  in  his  or her
      discretion  include  in  such  agreements  such  additional  terms   and
      conditions,  not inconsistent with this section, as he or she determines
      to be necessary in order to properly carry out the  provisions  of  this
      section.  The  commissioner may also adopt such rules and regulations as
      may be necessary to carry out the provisions of this section.
        c. (1) If, pursuant to  the  provisions  of  section  11-424  of  this
      chapter, an application for the release of property acquired by the city
      through  in  rem  tax  foreclosure  is made within the four-month period
      specified in subdivision f  of  section  11-424  of  this  chapter,  and
      provided  such  application  is  made  during  the  period  specified in
      subdivision  a  of  this  section,  the  following  paragraphs  of  this
      subdivision  shall, at the election of the applicant, apply with respect
      to such application and the release sought thereby.
    
        (2) At the time of filing the application for  release,  an  applicant
      who  elects  to  have the provisions of this subdivision apply to him or
      her, shall pay to the city the  amounts  specified  in  paragraphs  two,
      three  and  four of subdivision d of section 11-424 of this chapter, for
      this  purpose,  the  amount  specified in paragraph two thereof shall be
      deemed to be the amount which  would  have  been  required  to  be  paid
      thereunder  had  this  section  not  been in effect. Concurrent with the
      making of such payment, the applicant shall enter into an agreement with
      the commissioner of general services providing for the  payment  of  all
      current  taxes,  assessments  or  other legal charges on the property as
      they become due or within the grace period  provided  by  law,  and,  in
      addition, providing for the payment of the amount specified in paragraph
      one  of subdivision d of section 11-424 of this chapter in installments,
      the first of which shall be equal to at  least  twenty-five  percent  of
      such  amount  and shall be payable upon the execution of such agreement.
      The balance of such amount shall be payable in  twelve  equal  quarterly
      installments, each of which shall be paid quarterly on the first days of
      July, October, January and April.
        (3)  Pending approval by the corporation counsel of an application for
      release as to form, timeliness and eligibility  of  the  applicant,  all
      payments  made  pursuant  to  the  preceding  paragraph shall be held in
      escrow;  in  the  event  the   corporation   counsel   disapproves   the
      application,  such  payments shall be returned to the applicant, and the
      agreement executed by the applicant shall thereupon be cancelled.
        (4) In the case  of  any  agreement  made  and  executed  pursuant  to
      paragraph  two  hereof,  interest  on  any  installment  due and payable
      thereunder shall, notwithstanding the rates of  interest  prescribed  in
      section  11-224,  11-312  or 11-313 of this title, be charged, collected
      and received at the rate of seven percent per  annum  from  July  first,
      nineteen   hundred   seventy-seven  to  the  date  of  payment  of  each
      installment. Any interest accrued  or  accruing  prior  to  July  first,
      nineteen  hundred  seventy-seven shall not be affected by the provisions
      of this paragraph, but shall be charged, collected and received  in  the
      manner and at the rates specified in section 11-224, 11-312 or 11-313 of
      this  title.  The  seven  percent  rate  of  interest  specified in this
      paragraph shall be applicable only if (i) there is  no  default  in  the
      agreement  entered  into  as  provided in this subdivision, and (ii) all
      current taxes, assessments or other  legal  charges  are  paid  as  they
      become due or within the period of grace provided by law.
        (5)  No  release  for which application has been made pursuant to this
      subdivision shall be granted until the final payment under the agreement
      herein provided is received by the city.  Upon  receipt  of  such  final
      payment  by the city the corporation counsel shall effect the release in
      the manner provided in section 11-424 of this chapter. In the  event  of
      any  default in an agreement executed as provided in this subdivision or
      any failure to pay current taxes, assessments or other legal charges  as
      they  become  due  or  within  the  grace  period  provided by law, such
      agreement shall thereupon become void,  the  release  process  shall  be
      terminated,  and all payments theretofore made shall be forfeited to the
      city.
        (6) In addition to the terms and conditions required by the  preceding
      paragraphs  of  this subdivision to be included in agreements authorized
      thereby, the  commissioner  of  general  services  may  in  his  or  her
      discretion   include  in  such  agreements  such  additional  terms  and
      conditions, not inconsistent with this subdivision, as the  commissioner
      determines to be necessary in order to properly carry out the provisions
      hereof.  The  commissioner of general services may also adopt such rules
    
      and regulations as may be necessary to carry out the provisions of  this
      subdivision.

Section 11-426 ::    
        
     
        §  11-426  Agreements  for  payment of delinquent taxes and charges in
      installments.  a.  During  the  period  beginning  on  December  second,
      nineteen   hundred  seventy-seven  and  ending  on  March  thirty-first,
      nineteen hundred seventy-eight, the commissioner of finance, or, when so
      specified hereinafter, the commissioner of general  services,  shall  be
      authorized   and  empowered  to  make  and  execute  agreements  in  the
      circumstances and subject to the terms, conditions and  limitations  set
      forth in the following subdivisions of this section.
        b.  (1)  Whenever it shall appear that a tax lien on a parcel has been
      due and unpaid for a period of at least six  months  from  the  date  on
      which  the  tax,  assessment  or  other legal charge represented thereby
      became a lien, the commissioner of finance may enter into  an  agreement
      with  the  owner  of  such  parcel  or  other person claiming to have an
      interest therein providing for the payment  of  such  delinquent  taxes,
      assessments  or  other  legal  charges  and  interest  and  penalties in
      installments, the first of which shall be  equal  to  at  least  fifteen
      percent  of such arrears and shall be payable upon the execution of such
      agreement. Each remaining installment shall be  equal  to  at  least  an
      amount  produced  by  dividing  the  balance of such arrears by a factor
      determined by multiplying the number of quarters of such arrears by  two
      hundred  percent.  In no event, however, shall the factor referred to in
      the preceding sentence be in excess of thirty-two. Each  such  remaining
      installment  shall  be  payable  quarterly  on  the  first days of July,
      October, January and April.
        (2) If an agreement authorized by the preceding paragraph is  executed
      prior to the time the commissioner of finance files in the office of the
      appropriate county clerk a list of delinquent taxes covering the borough
      or  portion  of the borough in which the subject parcel is located, such
      parcel shall be excluded from such list of delinquent  taxes,  provided,
      at the time such list is filed, there is no default in the agreement and
      all  current taxes, assessments or other legal charges have been paid as
      they became due or within the period of grace provided by  law.  In  the
      event  of  any  default  in  the agreement or any failure to make timely
      payment of any current item, the parcel shall, if  then  delinquent  for
      the  applicable  period  specified in section 11-404 of this chapter, be
      eligible for inclusion in any list of delinquent taxes thereafter filed.
        (3) If an in rem foreclosure action has  been  commenced  against  any
      parcel  prior  to  December  second, nineteen hundred seventy-seven, the
      commissioner of finance may, notwithstanding the provisions of paragraph
      three of subdivision a of section 11-413 of this chapter, enter into  an
      agreement  authorized  and described in the foregoing provisions of this
      section with respect to such parcel. However, if such  an  agreement  is
      entered  into  subsequent  to  the last date for redemption specified in
      subdivision a of section 11-407 of this chapter, there shall be paid  to
      the  commissioner  of  finance at the time said agreement is executed an
      amount equal  to  the  penalty  which  would  have  been  payable  under
      subdivision c of section 11-407 of this chapter had the person executing
      the  agreement  made  a late redemption payment. Such amount shall be in
      addition to any installment payments  required  to  be  made  under  the
      agreement  and  shall  not  be  credited  against  any  such installment
      payments. Any parcel which is the subject of an agreement made  pursuant
      to  this  paragraph  may, prior to final judgment, be withdrawn from the
      action, provided there  has  been  no  default  in  the  agreement,  and
      provided  further  that  all  current  taxes, assessments or other legal
      charges are paid when they become due or  within  the  period  of  grace
      provided  by  law. Such withdrawal shall be effected by the commissioner
      of finance in the manner provided in section 11-413 of this chapter.
    
        (4) Any  person  who,  prior  to  December  second,  nineteen  hundred
      seventy-seven,  has  made,  executed  and filed with the commissioner of
      finance an agreement pursuant to the provisions of  paragraph  three  of
      subdivision  a  of section 11-413 of this chapter, shall be permitted to
      make  application  to  the  commissioner  of  finance for the purpose of
      having  such  agreement  cancelled  and  a  new  agreement  executed  as
      hereinabove provided.
        If  an  agreement  executed prior to December second, nineteen hundred
      seventy-seven is not cancelled as herein provided, any installments  due
      and  payable  under  such  agreement  on  or after April first, nineteen
      hundred seventy-eight shall be subject to interest at the rate specified
      in paragraph five of this subdivision, but only if, as of  April  first,
      nineteen hundred seventy-eight, there is no default in the agreement and
      all  current  taxes,  assessments  or other legal charges have been paid
      within the  time  allowed  by  law.  Such  rate  of  interest  shall  be
      calculated  in  the  manner  and  shall be subject to all the conditions
      provided in said paragraph five.
        (5) When an agreement has been entered into pursuant  to  any  of  the
      preceding  paragraphs  of  this subdivision, the commissioner of finance
      shall, notwithstanding the  rates  of  interest  prescribed  in  section
      11-224,  11-312  or  11-313  of  this title, charge, collect and receive
      interest on the arrears due and  payable  under  such  agreement  to  be
      calculated  at  the  rate  of  seven percent per annum from April first,
      nineteen  hundred  seventy-eight  to  the  date  of  payment   of   each
      installment.  Any  interest  accrued  or  accruing prior to April first,
      nineteen hundred seventy-eight shall not be affected by  the  provisions
      of  this  paragraph, but shall be charged, collected and received in the
      manner and at the rates specified in section 11-224, 11-312 or 11-313 of
      this title. The  seven  percent  rate  of  interest  specified  in  this
      paragraph  shall  be  applicable  only if (i) there is no default in the
      agreement entered into as provided in this section, and (ii) all current
      taxes, assessments or other legal charges are paid as they become due or
      within the period of grace provided by law. In the event of any  default
      or failure to make timely payment of any current item, the seven percent
      rate of interest specified in this paragraph shall thereupon cease to be
      applicable  and  the  commissioner  of  finance shall thereafter charge,
      collect and receive interest in the manner and at  the  rates  otherwise
      specified in this title.
        (6)  In addition to the terms and conditions required by the preceding
      paragraphs of this subdivision to be included in  agreements  authorized
      by  this  section,  the  commissioner  of  finance  may,  in  his or her
      discretion,  include  in  such  agreements  such  additional  terms  and
      conditions,  not  inconsistent  with  this section, as such commissioner
      determines to be necessary in order to properly carry out the provisions
      of this section. The commissioner of finance may also adopt  such  rules
      and  regulations as may be necessary to carry out the provisions of this
      section.
        c. (1) If, pursuant to  the  provisions  of  section  11-424  of  this
      chapter, an application for the release of property acquired by the city
      through  in  rem  tax  foreclosure  is made within the four-month period
      specified in subdivision f  of  section  11-424  of  this  chapter,  and
      provided  such  application  is  made  during  the  period  specified in
      subdivision  a  of  this  section,  the  following  paragraphs  of  this
      subdivision  shall, at the election of the applicant, apply with respect
      to such application and the release sought thereby.
        (2) At the time of filing the application for  release,  an  applicant
      who  elects  to  have the provisions of this subdivision apply to him or
      her, shall pay to the city the  amounts  specified  in  paragraphs  two,
    
      three  and  four of subdivision d of section 11-424 of this chapter, for
      this purpose, the amount specified in paragraph  two  thereof  shall  be
      deemed  to  be  the  amount  which  would  have been required to be paid
      thereunder  had  this  section  not  been in effect. Concurrent with the
      making of such payment, the applicant shall enter into an agreement with
      the commissioner of general services providing for the  payment  of  all
      current  taxes,  assessments  or  other legal charges on the property as
      they become due or within the grace period  provided  by  law,  and,  in
      addition, providing for the payment of the amount specified in paragraph
      one  of subdivision d of section 11-424 of this chapter in installments,
      the first of which shall be equal to at  least  twenty-five  percent  of
      such  amount  and shall be payable upon the execution of such agreement.
      The balance of such amount shall be payable in  twelve  equal  quarterly
      installments, each of which shall be paid quarterly on the first days of
      July, October, January and April.
        (3)  Pending approval by the corporation counsel of an application for
      release as to form, timeliness and eligibility  of  the  applicant,  all
      payments  made  pursuant  to  the  preceding  paragraph shall be held in
      escrow;  in  the  event  the   corporation   counsel   disapproves   the
      application,  such  payments shall be returned to the applicant, and the
      agreement executed by him or her shall thereupon be cancelled.
        (4) In the case  of  any  agreement  made  and  executed  pursuant  to
      paragraph  two  thereof,  interest  on  any  installment due and payable
      thereunder shall, notwithstanding the rates of  interest  prescribed  in
      section  11-224,  11-312  or 11-313 of this title, be charged, collected
      and received at the rate of seven percent per annum  from  April  first,
      nineteen   hundred   seventy-eight  to  the  date  of  payment  of  each
      installment. Any interest accrued or  accruing  prior  to  April  first,
      nineteen  hundred  seventy-eight shall not be affected by the provisions
      of this paragraph, but shall be charged, collected and received  in  the
      manner and at the rates specified in section 11-224, 11-312 or 11-313 of
      this  title.  The  seven  percent  rate  of  interest  specified in this

      agreement  entered  into  as  provided in this subdivision, and (ii) all
      current taxes, assessments or other  legal  charges  are  paid  as  they
      become due or within the period of grace provided by law.
        (5)  No  release  for which application has been made pursuant to this
      subdivision shall be granted until the final payment under the agreement
      herein provided is received by the city.  Upon  receipt  of  such  final
      payment  by the city the corporation counsel shall effect the release in
      the manner provided in section 11-424 of this chapter. In the  event  of
      any  default in an agreement executed as provided in this subdivision or
      any failure to pay current taxes, assessments or other legal charges  as
      they  become  due  or  within  the  grace  period  provided by law, such
      agreement shall thereupon become void,  the  release  process  shall  be
      terminated,  and all payments theretofore made shall be forfeited to the
      city.
        (6) In addition to the terms and conditions required by the  preceding
      paragraphs  of  this subdivision to be included in agreements authorized
      thereby, the commissioner  of  general  services  may,  in  his  or  her
      discretion,  include  in  such  agreements  such  additional  terms  and
      conditions, not inconsistent with this subdivision, as the  commissioner
      determines to be necessary in order to properly carry out the provisions

Section 11-427 ::    
        
     
        §  11-427  Agreements  for  payment of delinquent taxes and charges in
      installments. a. During the period beginning September  first,  nineteen
      hundred seventy-eight and ending December thirty-first, nineteen hundred
      seventy-eight,  the  commissioner  of  finance,  or,  when  so specified
      hereinafter, the commissioner of general services, shall  be  authorized
      and  empowered  to  make and execute agreements in the circumstances and
      subject to the terms,  conditions  and  limitations  set  forth  in  the
      following  subdivisions  of this section; provided, however, that if the
      commissioner of  finance  or,  where  applicable,  the  commissioner  of
      general  services,  determines  in  his or her sole discretion that good
      cause exists, he or she may make and execute such agreements  during  an
      additional  period  ending not later than January thirty-first, nineteen
      hundred seventy-nine.
        b. (1) Whenever it shall appear that a tax lien on a parcel  has  been
      due  and  unpaid  for  a  period of at least six months from the date on
      which the tax, assessment or  other  legal  charge  represented  thereby
      became  a  lien, the commissioner of finance may enter into an agreement
      with the owner of such parcel  or  other  person  claiming  to  have  an
      interest  therein  providing  for  the payment of such delinquent taxes,
      assessments or  other  legal  charges  and  interest  and  penalties  in
      installments,  the  first  of  which  shall be equal to at least fifteen
      percent of such arrears and shall be payable upon the execution of  such

      amount produced by dividing the balance of  such  arrears  by  a  factor
      determined by multiplying the number of quarters of such arrears by two.
        In  no  event,  however, shall the factor referred to in the preceding
      sentence be in excess of thirty-two.  Each  such  remaining  installment
      shall  be  payable quarterly on the first days of July, October, January
      and April.
        (2) If an agreement authorized by the preceding paragraph is  executed
      prior to the time the commissioner of finance files in the office of the
      appropriate county clerk a list of delinquent taxes covering the borough
      or  portion  of the borough in which the subject parcel is located, such
      parcel shall be excluded from such list of delinquent  taxes,  provided,
      at the time such list is filed, there is no default in the agreement and
      all  current taxes, assessments or other legal charges were paid as they
      became due or within the period of grace provided by law. In  the  event
      of any default in the agreement or any failure to make timely payment of
      any  current  item,  the  parcel  shall,  if  then  delinquent  for  the
      applicable period specified  in  section  11-404  of  this  chapter,  be
      eligible for inclusion in any list of delinquent taxes thereafter filed.
        (3)  If  an  in  rem foreclosure action has been commenced against any
      parcel prior to September first,  nineteen  hundred  seventy-eight,  the
      commissioner of finance may, notwithstanding the provisions of paragraph
      three  of subdivision a of section 11-413 of this chapter, enter into an
      agreement authorized and described in the foregoing provisions  of  this
      section  with  respect  to such parcel. However, if such an agreement is
      entered into subsequent to the last date  for  redemption  specified  in
      subdivision  a of section 11-407 of this chapter, there shall be paid to

      amount  equal  to  the  penalty  which  would  have  been  payable under
      subdivision c of section 11-407 of this chapter had the person executing
      the agreement made a late redemption payment. Such amount  shall  be  in
      addition  to  any  installment  payments  required  to be made under the
      agreement and  shall  not  be  credited  against  any  such  installment
      payments.  Any parcel which is the subject of an agreement made pursuant
      to this paragraph may, prior to final judgment, be  withdrawn  from  the
      action,  provided  there  has  been  no  default  in  the agreement, and
    
      provided further that all current  taxes,  assessments  or  other  legal
      charges  are  paid  when  they  become due or within the period of grace
      provided by law. Such withdrawal shall be effected by  the  commissioner
      of finance in the manner provided in section 11-413 of this chapter.
        (4)  Any  person  who,  prior  to  September  first,  nineteen hundred
      seventy-eight, has made, executed and filed  with  the  commissioner  of
      finance  an  agreement  pursuant to the provisions of paragraph three of
      subdivision a of section 11-413 of this chapter, shall be  permitted  to
      make  application  to  the  commissioner  of  finance for the purpose of
      having  such  agreement  cancelled  and  a  new  agreement  executed  as
      hereinabove provided.
        If  an  agreement  executed prior to September first, nineteen hundred
      seventy-eight is not cancelled as herein provided, any installments  due
      and  payable  under  such agreement on or after February first, nineteen
      hundred seventy-nine shall be subject to interest at the rate  specified
      in paragraph six of this subdivision, but only if, as of February first,
      nineteen  hundred seventy-nine, there is no default in the agreement and
      all current taxes, assessments or other legal  charges  have  been  paid
      within  the  time  allowed  by  law.  Such  rate  of  interest  shall be
      calculated in the manner and shall be  subject  to  all  the  conditions
      provided in said paragraph six.
        (5)  Notwithstanding  the preceding paragraphs of this subdivision, no
      owner of, or other person claiming to have an interest  in,  any  parcel
      shall  be  eligible  to  enter  into  an  agreement  authorized  by such
      paragraphs where such parcel was  included  in  an  in  rem  foreclosure
      action but was severed therefrom pursuant to the judgment of foreclosure
      in  such  action  because an answer was still pending as to such parcel.
      The commissioner of finance may, however, on notice to  the  corporation
      counsel,  enter  into  an  agreement with such owner or other interested
      person providing for the payment of all current  taxes,  assessments  or
      other legal charges on the parcel as they become due or within the grace
      period  provided  by law, and, in addition, providing for payment of the
      amount of all delinquent taxes, assessments or other legal  charges  and
      interest  due  as of the date the agreement is executed in installments,
      the first of which shall be equal to at  least  twenty-five  percent  of
      such  amount  and shall be payable upon the execution of such agreement,
      and the balance of which shall be  payable  in  twelve  equal  quarterly
      installments,  each  of  which  shall be paid on the first days of July,
      October, January and April. In addition, there  shall  be  paid  to  the
      commissioner of finance at the time such agreement is executed a penalty
      equal to five percent of the amount of the delinquent taxes, assessments
      or other legal charges and interest due as of the date of the agreement,
      which  penalty  shall  not exceed five hundred dollars. Any installments
      due  and  payable  on  or  after  February   first,   nineteen   hundred
      seventy-nine  under  an  agreement  described in this paragraph shall be
      subject to interest at the rate  specified  in  paragraph  six  of  this
      subdivision,  but  only  if,  as  of  February  first,  nineteen hundred
      seventy-nine, there is no default  in  the  agreement  and  all  current
      taxes, assessments or other legal charges have been paid within the time
      allowed  by law. Such rate of interest shall be calculated in the manner
      and shall be subject to all the conditions provided  in  said  paragraph
      six.
        Upon  receipt  of  the  final  payment due under an agreement executed
      pursuant  to  this  paragraph,  the  commissioner   of   finance   shall
      discontinue  the  in rem action pending with respect to the parcel which
      is the subject of such agreement,  and  shall  cancel  the  lis  pendens
      pertaining  thereto  by  issuing a certificate of withdrawal pursuant to
      section 11-413 of this chapter. In the event  of  any  default  in  such
    
      agreement  or  any  failure  to  pay current taxes, assessments or other
      legal charges as they become due or within the grace period provided  by
      law, such agreement and the answer which was the basis for the severance
      of  the  subject parcel from the in rem action shall both be deemed null
      and void and the city shall be entitled to acquire title to such  parcel
      by  entry of an appropriate supplemental judgment of foreclosure in such
      in rem action without further notice to the answering party.
        (6) When an agreement has been entered into pursuant  to  any  of  the
      preceding  paragraphs  of  this subdivision, the commissioner of finance
      shall, notwithstanding the  rates  of  interest  prescribed  in  section
      11-224,  11-312  or  11-313  of  this title, charge, collect and receive
      interest on the arrears due and payable  under  such  agreement,  to  be
      calculated  at  the rate of seven percent per annum from February first,
      nineteen  hundred  seventy-nine  to  the  date  of   payment   of   each
      installment.  Any  interest accrued or accruing prior to February first,
      nineteen hundred seventy-nine shall not be affected by the provisions of
      this paragraph, but shall be charged,  collected  and  received  in  the
      manner and at the rates specified in section 11-224, 11-312 or 11-313 of
      this  title.  The  seven  percent  rate  of  interest  specified in this
      paragraph shall be applicable only if (i) there is  no  default  in  the
      agreement entered into as provided in this section, and (ii) all current
      taxes, assessments or other legal charges are paid as they become due or
      within  the period of grace provided by law. In the event of any default
      or failure to make timely payment of any current item, the seven percent
      rate of interest specified in this paragraph shall thereupon cease to be
      applicable and the commissioner  of  finance  shall  thereafter  charge,
      collect  and  receive  interest in the manner and at the rates otherwise
      specified in this chapter.
        (7) In addition to the terms and conditions required by the  preceding
      paragraphs  of  this subdivision to be included in agreements authorized
      by this section,  the  commissioner  of  finance  may,  in  his  or  her
      discretion,  include  in  such  agreements  such  additional  terms  and
      conditions, not inconsistent with  this  section,  as  the  commissioner
      determines to be necessary in order to properly carry out the provisions
      of  this  section.  The  commissioner  may  also  adopt  such  rules and
      regulations as may be necessary to carry  out  the  provisions  of  this
      section.
        c.  (1)  If,  pursuant  to  the  provisions  of section 11-424 of this
      chapter, an application for the release of property acquired by the city
      through in rem tax foreclosure has  been  filed  within  the  four-month
      period  specified  in  subdivision  f of that section, and the sixty-day
      period for payment referred to in that subdivision has not expired prior
      to the commencement of the period specified in  subdivision  a  of  this
      section,  the  following  paragraphs  of  this subdivision shall, at the
      election of the applicant, apply with respect to  such  application  and
      the release sought thereby, provided notice of such election is given to
      the  commissioner  of  general  services  during the period specified in
      subdivision a of this section, but in no event later than the  last  day
      of  the  sixty-day period referred to in subdivision f of section 11-424
      of this chapter.
        (2) An applicant who elects to have the provisions of this subdivision
      apply to him or her, shall, at the  time  such  applicant  notifies  the
      commissioner of general services of his or her election, pay to the city
      the amounts specified in paragraphs two, three and four of subdivision d
      of  section  11-424  of  this  chapter;  for  this  purpose,  the amount
      specified in paragraph two thereof shall be  deemed  to  be  the  amount
      which  would  have  been required to be paid thereunder had this section
      not been in effect. Concurrent with the  making  of  such  payment,  the
    
      applicant shall enter into an agreement with the commissioner of general
      services  providing for the payment of all current taxes, assessments or
      other legal charges on the property as they become  due  or  within  the
      grace  period  provided  by  law,  and,  in  addition, providing for the
      payment of the amount specified in paragraph one  of  subdivision  d  of
      section 11-424 of this chapter in installments, the first of which shall
      be  equal  to  at  least twenty-five percent of such amount and shall be
      payable upon the execution of such agreement. The balance of such amount
      shall be payable in twelve equal quarterly installments, each  of  which
      shall  be paid quarterly on the first days of July, October, January and
      April.
        (3) Pending approval by the corporation counsel of an application  for
      release  as  to  form,  timeliness and eligibility of the applicant, all
      payments made pursuant to the  preceding  paragraph  shall  be  held  in
      escrow;   in   the   event   the  corporation  counsel  disapproves  the
      application, such payments shall be returned to the applicant,  and  the
      agreement executed by him or her shall thereupon be cancelled.
        (4)  In  the  case  of  any  agreement  made  and executed pursuant to
      paragraph two of this subdivision, interest on any installment  due  and
      payable   thereunder   shall,  notwithstanding  the  rates  of  interest
      prescribed in section  11-224,  11-312  or  11-313  of  this  title,  be
      charged,  collected  and received at the rate of seven percent per annum
      from February first,  nineteen  hundred  seventy-nine  to  the  date  of
      payment  of  each installment. Any interest accrued or accruing prior to
      February first, nineteen hundred seventy-nine shall not be  affected  by
      the  provisions  of  this paragraph, but shall be charged, collected and
      received in the manner and at the rates  specified  in  section  11-224,
      11-312  or  11-313  of  this  title.  The seven percent rate of interest
      specified in this paragraph shall be applicable only if (i) there is  no
      default  in  the agreement entered into as provided in this subdivision,
      and (ii) all current taxes, assessments or other legal charges are  paid
      as they become due or within the period of grace provided by law.
        (5)  No  release  for  which  application  has  been  made pursuant to
      subdivision f of section 11-424 of this chapter shall be  granted  until
      the final payment under the agreement herein provided is received by the
      city.  Upon  receipt  of  such final payment by the city the corporation
      counsel shall effect the release  in  the  manner  provided  in  section
      11-424  of  this  chapter.  In  the event of any default in an agreement
      executed as provided in this subdivision or any failure to  pay  current
      taxes,  assessments  or other legal charges as they become due or within
      the grace period provided by law, such agreement shall thereupon  become
      void,   the  release  process  shall  be  terminated  and  all  payments
      theretofore made shall be forfeited to the city.
        (6) In addition to the terms and conditions required by the  preceding
      paragraphs  of  this subdivision to be included in agreements authorized
      thereby, the commissioner  of  general  services  may,  in  his  or  her
      discretion,  include  in  such  agreements  such  additional  terms  and
      conditions, not inconsistent with this subdivision, as the  commissioner
      determines to be necessary in order to properly carry out the provisions
      hereof.  The  commissioner of general services may also adopt such rules
      and regulations as may be necessary to carry out the provisions of  this
      subdivision.

        §  11-428  Disposition  of proceeds of sales of properties acquired by
      city through tax enforcement foreclosure proceedings.  The  proceeds  of
      the  sale  of real property acquired through tax enforcement foreclosure
      proceedings, or by deed in lieu thereof, including  subsequent  receipts
      in  diminution of purchase money mortgages accepted at the time of sale,
      shall be applied as follows:
        a. The amount of the unpaid real estate  taxes  accrued  against  such
      property  from  the  first  day  of  January  or  the first day of July,
      whichever first immediately precedes the date on which title  vested  in
      the  city  to  the  date  of  conveyance  of  title by the city, without
      interest or penalties thereon, shall be credited to the  tax  deficiency
      account.
        b.  The  balance,  if  any,  remaining  after  deduction of the amount
      specified  in  paragraph  a  hereof,  shall  be  paid  into  the   funds
      hereinafter specified in the following order:
        1.  A  sum  equal  to  the  amount of the unpaid assessments for local
      improvements accrued against such property at the date  of  commencement
      of  the foreclosure proceeding and up to the date of conveyance of title
      by the city, without interest or penalties thereon, shall be  paid  into
      the appropriate assessment funds.
        2. A sum equal to the amount of unpaid sewer rents, including interest
      and  penalties  thereon,  accrued  against  such property at the date of

      purchase  money  mortgage  accepted by the city at the time of such sale
      shall be paid into the general fund. In the event that any part of  such
      balance  is represented by bonds and mortgages, such bonds and mortgages
      may be deposited in the tax appropriation and general fund stabilization
      reserve fund and a sum equal to the amount of the  cash  represented  by
      such bonds and mortgages shall in such event be transferred from the tax
      appropriation and general fund stabilization reserve fund to the general
