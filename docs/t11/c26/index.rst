      dollar  is  hereby  imposed  on such mortgage and shall be collected and
      paid as provided in this chapter.
        e. (1) For the purpose of determining whether a mortgage is subject to
      the tax imposed by subdivision b or c of  this  section  at  a  rate  in
      excess  of fifty cents, or by subdivision d of this section at a rate in
      excess of one dollar, for each one hundred dollars  and  each  remaining
      major  fraction  thereof  of principal debt or obligation, the principal
      debt or obligation which is or under any contingency may be  secured  at
      the  date  of  execution  thereof,  or  at  any time thereafter, by such
      mortgage shall be aggregated with the principal debt or obligation which
      is or under any contingency may be secured  at  the  date  of  execution
      thereof,  or  at  any time thereafter, by any other mortgage, where such
      mortgages form part of the same or related  transactions  and  have  the
      same  or related mortgagors. If the commissioner of taxation and finance
      finds that a mortgage transaction or  mortgage  transactions  have  been
      formulated  for the purpose of avoiding or evading a rate of tax imposed
      under this section in excess of the lowest such rate, rather than solely
      for an independent business  or  financial  purpose,  such  commissioner
      shall  treat  all  of  the mortgages forming part of such transaction or
      transactions as a single mortgage for the  purpose  of  determining  the
      applicable  rate  of  tax.  For  the  purposes  of this subdivision, all
      mortgages having the same or related mortgagors  offered  for  recording
      within  a  period of twelve consecutive months shall be presumed to form
      part of a related transaction, unless clear and convincing  evidence  is
      offered  to  the  contrary. The commissioner of taxation and finance may
      require such affidavits and forms, and  may  prescribe  such  rules  and
      regulations,  as he determines to be necessary to enforce the provisions
      of this subdivision.
        (2) The term "related", when used in this subdivision  with  reference
      to mortgagors, shall include, but shall not be limited to, the following
      relationships:
        (i)   members  of  a  family,  including  spouses,  ancestors,  lineal
      descendants, and brothers and sisters (whether  by  the  whole  or  half
      blood);
        (ii)  a  shareholder  and a corporation more than fifty percent of the
      value of the outstanding stock of which is owned or controlled  directly
      or indirectly by such shareholder;
        (iii)  a  partner  and  a  partnership  more than fifty percent of the
      capital or profits interest in which is owned or controlled directly  or
      indirectly by such partner;
        (iv)  a  beneficiary  and  a  trust  more  than  fifty  percent of the
      beneficial  interest  in  which  is  owned  or  controlled  directly  or
      indirectly by such beneficiary;
        (v)  two  or more corporations, partnerships, associations, or trusts,
      or any combination  thereof,  which  are  owned  or  controlled,  either
      directly or indirectly, by the same person, corporation or other entity,
      or interests; and
        (vi) a grantor of a trust and such trust.
        f.  Notwithstanding  any provision to the contrary in paragraph (a) of
      subdivision one of section two hundred fifty-five of the  tax  law,  the
      taxes  imposed by subdivision c or d of this section shall also apply to
      principal indebtedness or obligation  secured  by  or  which  under  any
      contingency  may  be  secured by a supplemental instrument or additional
      mortgage, whether or not there is any new  or  further  indebtedness  or
      obligation  other  than the principal indebtedness or obligation secured
    
      by a recorded primary mortgage, where (1) the supplemental instrument or
      additional mortgage imposes the lien of a recorded  mortgage  upon  real
      property situated within the city not previously subject to the mortgage
      or  where  an  additional  mortgage  upon  such  additional  property is
      recorded as  additional  or  substitute  security  for  indebtedness  or
      obligation  already  secured by a recorded mortgage and (2) the recorded
      primary mortgage was on real property  outside  the  city  and  recorded
      without payment of the city tax.

      chapter  shall  be  payable  on  the  recording of each mortgage of real
      property subject to taxes thereunder. Such taxes shall be  paid  to  the
      recording  officer  of the county in which the real property or any part
      thereof is situated, except where real property is situated  within  and
      without  the  city,  the  recording  officer  of the county in which the
      mortgage is first  recorded  shall  collect  the  tax  imposed  by  this
      chapter,  as  required  by  subdivision  three  of  section  two hundred
      fifty-three-a of the tax law. It shall be the  duty  of  such  recording
      officer  to  indorse  upon each mortgage a receipt for the amount of the
      tax so paid. Any mortgage so endorsed may  thereupon  or  thereafter  be
      recorded  by any recording officer and the receipt for such tax indorsed
      upon each mortgage shall be  recorded  therewith.  The  record  of  such
      receipt  shall be conclusive proof that the amount of tax stated therein
      has been paid upon such mortgage. Upon the first day of each  month  the
      city  register  and  the  recording officer of Richmond county shall pay
      over to the commissioner of finance  of  the  city  for  credit  to  the
      general fund of such city, the balance of the moneys received during the
      preceding  month  upon  account  of  taxes  paid to him or her as herein
      prescribed, after deducting the necessary expenses of his or her  office
      as  provided  in  section  two  hundred sixty-two of the tax law, except
      taxes paid upon mortgages which are  first  to  be  apportioned  by  the
      commissioner  of  taxation  and  finance, which taxes and money shall be
      paid over by him or her as provided by the  determination  of  the  said
      commissioner  of  taxation  and  finance.  Notwithstanding the foregoing
      provision, in each instance where the tax imposed  pursuant  to  section
      11-2601 of this chapter is one dollar and twenty-five cents for each one
      hundred  dollars  and  each  remaining  major  fraction  thereof of such
      principal debt or obligation, fifty percent of the total amount of  such
      tax, including fifty percent of any interest or penalties thereon, shall
      be set aside in a special account by the commissioner of finance, and in
      each  instance  where  the  tax  imposed pursuant to that section is one
      dollar and seventy-five cents for each  one  hundred  dollars  and  each
      remaining  major  fraction thereof of such principal debt or obligation,
      thirty-five and seven-tenths percent of the total amount  of  such  tax,
      including  thirty-five  and  seven-tenths  percent  of  any  interest or
      penalties thereon, shall also be set  aside  in  such  special  account.
      Moneys in such account shall be used for payment by such commissioner to
      the  state  comptroller  for deposit in the urban mass transit operating
      assistance account of the mass transportation operating assistance  fund
      of  any  amount  of  insufficiency  certified  by  the state comptroller
      pursuant to the provisions of subdivision six of section  eighty-eight-a
      of  the  state finance law, and on the fifteenth day of each month, such
      commissioner shall transmit all funds in such account at the end of  the
      preceding  month,  except  the  amount  required  for the payment of any
      amount of insufficiency certified by  the  state  comptroller  and  such
      amount  as  he or she deems necessary for refunds and such other amounts
      necessary to finance the New York city transportation disabled committee
      and the New York city  paratransit  system  as  established  by  section
      fifteen-b  of  the  transportation  law,  provided,  however,  that such
      amounts shall not exceed six percent of the total funds in  the  account
      but  in  no  event be less than two hundred twenty-five thousand dollars
      beginning April first, nineteen hundred  eighty-six,  and  further  that
      beginning  November  fifteenth,  nineteen hundred eighty-four and during
      the entire period prior to operation of such system, the total  of  such
      amounts shall not exceed three hundred seventy-five thousand dollars for
      the administrative expenses of such committee and fifty thousand dollars
      for  the  expenses  of  the agency designated pursuant to paragraph b of
    
      subdivision five of such section, and other amounts necessary to finance
      the operating needs of the private bus companies franchised by the  city
      of  New  York  and  eligible to receive state operating assistance under

        ยง  11-2603  Manner of administration and collection. The taxes imposed
      under this chapter shall be  administered  and  collected  in  the  same
      manner as the taxes imposed under subdivision one of section two hundred
      fifty-three and subdivision one of section two hundred fifty-five of the
      tax law. All the provisions of article eleven of the tax law relating to
      or  applicable to the administration and collection of the taxes imposed
      by subdivision one of section two hundred  fifty-three  and  subdivision
      one  of section two hundred fifty-five of the tax law shall apply to the
      taxes imposed under this chapter with the same force and  effect  as  if
      those  provisions  had  been set forth in full in this chapter except to
      the extent that  any  such  provision  is  either  inconsistent  with  a
      provision  of  this  chapter  or not relevant to the tax imposed by this
      chapter. For purposes of this chapter any reference in article eleven of
      the tax law to the tax or taxes imposed by such article shall be  deemed
      to  refer  to  a  tax  imposed by this chapter, and any reference to the
      phrase "within this state" shall be read as "within this city" unless  a
      different meaning is clearly required. Whenever real property covered by
      the  mortgage  is partly within and partly without the city of New York,
      the portion  of  the  mortgage  taxable  under  this  chapter  shall  be
      determined  in  the  manner prescribed in the first paragraph of section
      two hundred sixty of the tax law where the property without the city  is
      located  within  the  state  and, in the manner prescribed in the second
      paragraph of such section of the tax law, where the property without the
      city is located without the state.
