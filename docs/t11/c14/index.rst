      hundred eighty, there is hereby imposed and there shall be paid a tax on
      each transfer of a taxicab license or interest therein, at the  rate  of
      five percent of the consideration given for such transfer.
        b.  Where  there  is  a transfer of the economic interest in a taxicab
      license or interest therein, effected by the transfer of shares of stock
      of a corporation which hold such taxicab license or interest therein  or
      by  the  transfer  of  an  interest  or  interests  in  a partnership or
      association which holds such taxicab license or interest  therein,  such
      transfer  of  shares  of  stock  or  of  an  interest  or interests in a
      partnership or association shall be treated as a transfer of the taxicab
      license or interest therein, and shall be subject to the tax imposed  by
      subdivision a of this section.
        c.  Notwithstanding  any  other  provision  of  this  chapter, the tax
      imposed hereby shall not apply to a transfer made  pursuant  to  a  bona
      fide  written  contract  or  agreement  made  and executed prior to July

Section 11-1406 ::    
        
     
        §  11-1406  Determination of tax. If a return required by this chapter
      is not filed, or if a return when filed is  incorrect  or  insufficient,
      the amount of tax due shall be determined by the commissioner of finance
      from  external  indices and such other information as may be obtainable.
      Notice of such determination shall be given to the person liable for the
      tax. Such determination shall finally and irrevocably fix the tax unless
      the person against whom it is assessed, within  ninety  days  after  the
      giving  of  notice  of  such  determination,  or, if the commissioner of
      finance has established a conciliation  procedure  pursuant  to  section
      11-124  of  the  code  and  the  taxpayer  has  requested a conciliation
      conference in accordance therewith, within ninety days from the  mailing
      of   a   conciliation   decision  or  the  date  of  the  commissioner's
      confirmation of the discontinuance of the conciliation proceeding,  both
      (1)  serves  a petition upon the commissioner of finance and (2) files a
      petition with the tax appeals tribunal for  a  hearing,  or  unless  the
      commissioner  of  finance of his or her own motion shall redetermine the
      same. Such hearing and any appeal to the tax appeals tribunal sitting en
      banc from the decision rendered in such hearing shall  be  conducted  in
      the manner and subject to the requirements prescribed by the tax appeals
      tribunal  pursuant  to  sections  one  hundred  sixty-eight thorough one
      hundred seventy-two of the charter. After such hearing the  tax  appeals
      tribunal  shall  give  notice of its decision to the person against whom
      the tax is assessed and to the commissioner of finance.  A  decision  of
      the  tax appeals tribunal sitting en banc shall be reviewable for error,
      illegality or unconstitutionality or any other reason  whatsoever  by  a
      proceeding  under  article  seventy-eight  of the civil practice law and
      rules if application therefor is made to the supreme court by the person
      against whom the tax was assessed within four months after the giving of
      the notice of such tax appeals tribunal  decision.  A  proceeding  under
      article  seventy-eight  of the civil practice law and rules shall not be
      instituted by a taxpayer unless: (a) the amount of any tax sought to  be
      reviewed,  with  penalties  and interest thereon, if any, shall be first
      deposited with the commissioner of finance and there shall be filed with
      the commissioner of finance an undertaking, issued by a  surety  company
      authorized  to  transact  business  in  this  state  and approved by the
      superintendent  of  insurance  of  this  state  as   to   solvency   and
      responsibility,  in  such  amount and with such sureties as a justice of
      the supreme court shall approve, to the effect that if  such  proceeding
      be  dismissed  or the tax confirmed, the taxpayer will pay all costs and
      charges which may accrue in the prosecution of the proceeding; or (b) at
      the option of the taxpayer such undertaking filed with the  commissioner
      of  finance may be in a sum sufficient to cover the taxes, penalties and
      interest thereon stated in such decision  plus  the  costs  and  charges
      which  may  accrue  against  it in the prosecution of the proceeding, in
      which event the taxpayer shall not be required to  deposit  such  taxes,
      penalties and interest as a condition precedent to the application.
    
    
    
    
    
    
    

Section 11-1407
---------------

Section 11-1407 ::    
        
     
        §  11-1407  Refunds.  a.  In  the  manner provided in this section the
      commissioner of finance shall refund or credit,  without  interest,  any
      tax,  penalty  or  interest erroneously, illegally or unconstitutionally
      collected or paid if application to the commissioner of finance for such
      refund shall be made within one year from the payment thereof.  Whenever
      a  refund  is  made  or  denied  by  the  commissioner  of  finance, the
      commissioner shall state his or her  reason  therefor  and  give  notice
      thereof  to the taxpayer in writing. Such application may be made by the
      transferee or transferor who has actually paid the tax. The commissioner
      of finance may, in lieu of any refund required to be made, allow  credit
      therefor on payments due from the applicant.
        b.  Any  determination of the commissioner of finance denying a refund
      or credit pursuant to subdivision a of this section shall be  final  and
      irrevocable  unless  the  applicant  for  such  refund or credit, within
      ninety days from the mailing of notice of such determination, or, if the
      commissioner  of  finance  has  established  a  conciliation   procedure
      pursuant   to   section   11-124  and  the  applicant  has  requested  a
      conciliation conference in accordance therewith, within ninety days from
      the mailing of a conciliation decision or the date of the commissioner's
      confirmation of the discontinuance of the conciliation proceeding,  both
      (1)  serves  a petition upon the commissioner of finance and (2) files a
      petition with the tax appeals tribunal for a hearing. Such petition  for
      a  refund  or  credit,  made  as  herein  provided,  shall  be deemed an
      application for a revision of any tax, penalty  or  interest  complained
      of.  Such  hearing and any appeal to the tax appeals tribunal sitting en
      banc from the decision rendered in such hearing shall  be  conducted  in
      the manner and subject to the requirements prescribed by the tax appeals
      tribunal  pursuant  to  sections  one  hundred  sixty-eight  through one
      hundred seventy-two of the charter. After such hearing, the tax  appeals
      tribunal  shall  give notice of its decision to the applicant and to the
      commissioner of finance. The applicant shall be  entitled  to  review  a
      decision  of  the  tax  appeals tribunal sitting en banc by a proceeding
      pursuant to article seventy-eight of the civil practice law  and  rules,
      provided  such  proceeding  is  instituted  within four months after the
      giving of notice of such decision, and  provided,  in  the  case  of  an
      application by a taxpayer, that a final determination of tax due was not
      previously made. Such a proceeding shall not be instituted by a taxpayer
      unless  an undertaking is filed with the commissioner of finance in such
      amount and with such sureties as a justice of the  supreme  court  shall
      approve  to  the  effect that if such proceeding be dismissed or the tax
      confirmed, the taxpayer will pay all costs and charges which may  accrue
      in the prosecution of such proceeding.
        c.  A  person  shall  not  be entitled to a revision, refund or credit
      under this section of a tax, or penalty which had been determined to  be
      due  pursuant to the provisions of section 11-1406 of this chapter where
      such person has had a hearing  or  an  opportunity  for  a  hearing,  as
      provided  in  said section, or has failed to avail himself or herself of
      the remedies therein provided. No refund or credit shall be  made  of  a
      tax,  interest or penalty paid after a determination by the commissioner
      of finance made pursuant to section 11-1406 of this chapter unless it be
      found that such determination was erroneous, illegal or unconstitutional
      or otherwise improper, by the tax appeals tribunal after a  hearing,  or
      on  the  commissioner's  own  motion,  or,  is such tax appeals tribunal
      affirms in whole or in part the determination  of  the  commissioner  of
      finance,  in  a  proceeding  under  article  seventy-eight  of the civil
      practice law and rules, pursuant to the provisions of said  section,  in
      which  event refund or credit without interest shall be made of the tax,
      interest or penalty found to be overpaid.

---------------

Section 11-1408 ::    
        
     
        §  11-1408  Reserves.  In cases where the transferee or transferor has
      applied for a refund and  has  instituted  a  proceeding  under  article
      seventy-eight   of  the  civil  practice  law  and  rules  to  review  a
      determination adverse to the transferee or  transferor  on  his  or  her
      application  for  refund,  the  comptroller  shall  set  up  appropriate
      reserves to meet any decisions adverse to the city.
    
    
    
    
    
    
    

Section 11-1409
---------------

Section 11-1409 ::    
        
     
        §  11-1409  Remedies  exclusive.  The  remedies  provided  by sections
      11-1406 and 11-1407 of this chapter  shall  be  the  exclusive  remedies
      available  to any person for the review of tax liability imposed by this
      chapter; and no  determination  or  proposed  determination  of  tax  or
      determination  on  any  application  for  refund  by the commissioner of
      finance, nor any decision by the tax appeals  tribunal  or  any  of  its
      administrative law judges shall be enjoined or reviewed by an action for
      declaratory  judgment,  an  action  for money had and received or by any
      action or proceeding other than, in the case of a decision  by  the  tax
      appeals  tribunal  sitting  en  banc,  a  proceeding  in the nature of a
      certiorari proceeding under article seventy-eight of the civil  practice
      law  and  rules;  provided,  however,  that  a  taxpayer  may proceed by
      declaratory judgment if the taxpayer institutes suit within thirty  days
      after  a  deficiency  assessment  is  made  and  pays  the amount of the
      deficiency assessment to  the  commissioner  of  finance  prior  to  the
      institution  of  such  suit  and  posts  a bond for costs as provided in
      section 11-1406 of this chapter.
    
    
    
    
    
    
    

Section 11-1410
---------------

Section 11-1410 ::    
        
     
        §  11-1410  Proceedings  to recover tax. a. Whenever any transferee or
      transferor shall fail to pay any tax, penalty  or  interest  imposed  by
      this chapter as herein provided, the corporation counsel shall, upon the
      request  of  the commissioner of finance bring or cause to be brought an
      action to enforce the payment of the same on behalf of the city  of  New
      York  in  any court of the state of New York or of any other state or of
      the United States. If, however, the commissioner of finance  in  his  or
      her  discretion  believes that any such transferee or transferor subject
      to the provisions of this chapter is about to cease business, leave  the
      state  or remove or dissipate the assets out of which the tax or penalty
      might be satisfied, and that any such tax or penalty will  not  be  paid
      when  due,  the  commissioner  may  declare  such  tax  or penalty to be
      immediately due and payable and may issue a warrant immediately.
        b. As an additional or alternate remedy, the commissioner  of  finance
      may issue a warrant, directed to the city sheriff commanding the sheriff
      to  levy  upon and sell the real and personal property of the transferee
      or transferor or other person liable for the  tax  which  may  be  found
      within the city, for the payment of the amount thereof, with any penalty
      and  interest, and the cost of executing the warrant, and to return such
      warrant to the commissioner of finance and to pay  to  the  commissioner
      the  money  collected  by  virtue  thereof  within  sixty days after the
      receipt of such warrant. The city sheriff shall within five  days  after
      the  receipt  of  the warrant file with the county clerk a copy thereof,
      and thereupon such clerk shall enter in the judgment docket the name  of
      the  person  mentioned in the warrant and the amount of the tax, penalty
      and interest for which the warrant is issued and the date when such copy
      is filed. Thereupon the amount of such warrant so docketed shall  become
      a  lien upon the title to and the interest in real and personal property
      of the person against whom the warrant is issued. The city sheriff shall
      then proceed upon the warrant in the same manner, and with like  effect,
      as that provided by law in respect to executions issued against property
      upon  judgments  of  a court of record and for services in executing the
      warrant the sheriff shall be entitled to the same fees, which he or  she
      may collect in the same manner. In the discretion of the commissioner of
      finance  a  warrant  of  like  terms, force and effect may be issued and
      directed to an officer or employee of the department of finance, and  in
      the execution thereof such officer or employee shall have all the powers
      conferred  by  law  upon  sheriffs,  but  shall be entitled to no fee or
      compensation in excess of the actual expenses paid in the performance of
      such duty.  If  a  warrant  is  returned  not  satisfied  in  full,  the
      commissioner  of  finance  may  from time to time issue new warrants and
      shall also have the same remedies to enforce the amount  due  thereunder
      as if the city had recovered judgment therefor and execution thereon had
      been returned unsatisfied.
        c.  Whenever  there  is made a sale, transfer or assignment in bulk or
      any part of the whole of a stock  of  merchandise  or  of  fixtures,  or
      merchandise and of fixtures pertaining to the conducting of the business
      of  the  seller,  transferor or assignor, otherwise than in the ordinary
      course of trade and in the regular prosecution  of  said  business,  the
      purchaser,  transferee or assignee shall at least ten days before taking
      possession of such merchandise, fixtures, or merchandise  and  fixtures,
      or  paying  therefor,  notify  the commissioner of finance by registered
      mail of the proposed sale and of the price, terms and conditions thereof
      whether or not the seller, transferor or assignor, has  represented  to,
      or  informed  the purchaser, transferee or assignee that it owes any tax
      pursuant to this chapter and whether or not the purchaser, transferee or
      assignee has knowledge that such taxes are owing, and whether  any  such
      taxes are in fact owing.
    
        d.  Whenever, the purchaser, transferee or assignee shall fail to give
      notice to the commissioner of  finance  as  required  by  the  preceding
      subdivision,  or  whenever  the commissioner of finance shall inform the
      purchaser, transferee or assignee that a possible claim for such tax  or
      taxes  exists, any sums of money, property or choses in action, or other
      consideration, which the purchaser, transferee or assignee  is  required
      to  transfer  over to the seller or assignor shall be subject to a first
      priority right and lien for any such  taxes  theretofore  or  thereafter
      determined  to  be  due  from  the seller, transferor or assignor to the
      city, and  the  purchaser,  transferee  or  assigneee  is  forbidden  to
      transfer  to  the seller, transferor or assignor any such sums of money,
      property or choses in action to the extent of the amount of  the  city's
      claim.  For  failure  to comply with the provisions of this subdivision,
      the purchaser, transferee or assignee, in addition to being  subject  to
      the liabilities and remedies imposed under the provisions of article six
      of  the  uniform  commercial  code,  shall  be personally liable for the
      payment to  the  city  of  any  such  taxes  theretofore  or  thereafter
      determined  to  be  due  to  the  city  from  the  seller, transferor or
      assignor, and such liability may be assessed and enforced  in  the  same
      manner as the liability for tax under this chapter.
        e.  The commissioner of finance, if he or she finds that the interests
      of the city will not thereby be jeopardized, and upon such conditions as
      the commissioner of finance may require, may release any  property  from
      the  lien  of  any  warrant  or  vacate  such  warrant for unpaid taxes,
      additions to tax, penalties and interest filed pursuant to subdivision b
      of this section, and such release or vacating  of  the  warrant  may  be
      recorded  in  the  office of any recording officer in which such warrant
      has been filed. The clerk shall thereupon cancel and discharge as of the
      original date of docketing the vacated warrant.

Section 11-1413 ::    
        
     
        §  11-1413  Interest  and penalties. (a) Interest on underpayments. If
      any amount of tax is not paid on or before the last date prescribed  for
      payment  (without  regard to any extension of time granted for payment),
      interest on such amount at the rate set by the commissioner  of  finance
      pursuant  to  subdivision (g) of this section, or, if no rate is set, at
      the rate of seven and one-half percent per annum, shall be paid for  the
      period  from  such  last  date  to the date of payment. In computing the
      amount of interest to be paid, such interest shall be compounded  daily.
      Interest  under this subdivision shall not be paid if the amount thereof
      is less than one dollar.
        (b) * (1) Failure to file return. (A) In case of  failure  to  file  a
      return  under  this chapter on or before the prescribed date (determined
      with regard to any extension of time for filing),  unless  it  is  shown
      that  such  failure  is  due  to reasonable cause and not due to willful
      neglect, there shall be added to the amount required to be shown as  tax
      on  such return five percent of the amount of such tax if the failure is
      for not more than one month, with an additional five  percent  for  each
      additional   month   or  fraction  thereof  during  which  such  failure
      continues, not exceeding twenty-five percent in the aggregate.
        (B) In the case of a failure to file a return of tax within sixty days
      of the date prescribed for filing of such return (determined with regard
      to any extension of time for filing),  unless  it  is  shown  that  such
      failure  is  due to reasonable cause and not due to willful neglect, the
      addition to tax under subparagraph (A) of this paragraph  shall  not  be
      less  than  the  lesser of one hundred dollars or one hundred percent of
      the amount required to be shown as tax on such return.
        (C) For purposes of this paragraph, the amount of tax required  to  be
      shown  on  the  return shall be reduced by the amount of any part of the
      tax which is paid on or before the date prescribed for  payment  of  the
      tax and by the amount of any credit against the tax which may be claimed
      upon the return.
        * NB Amended Ch. 765/85 § 78, language juxtaposed per Ch. 907/85 § 14
        (2)  Failure to pay tax shown on return. In case of failure to pay the
      amount shown as tax on a return required to be filed under this  chapter
      on  or  before  the  prescribed  date  (determined  with  regard  to any
      extension of time for payment), unless it is shown that such failure  is
      due  to  reasonable cause and not due to willful neglect, there shall be
      added to the amount shown as tax on such return one-half of one  percent
      of the amount of such tax if the failure is not for more than one month,
      with  an additional one-half of one percent for each additional month or
      fraction thereof during which  such  failure  continues,  not  exceeding
      twenty-five  percent  in the aggregate. For the purpose of computing the
      addition for any month the amount of tax shown on the  return  shall  be
      reduced  by the amount of any part of the tax which is paid on or before
      the beginning of such month and by the amount of any credit against  the
      tax  which may be claimed upon the return. If the amount of tax required
      to be shown on a return is less than the amount shown  as  tax  on  such
      return,  this  paragraph  shall  be  applied  by substituting such lower
      amount.
        (3) Failure to pay tax required to be shown  on  return.  In  case  of
      failure  to pay any amount in respect of any tax required to be shown on
      a return required to be filed under this chapter which is not  so  shown
      (including  a  determination  made  pursuant  to section 11-1406 of this
      chapter) within ten days of the date of a notice  and  demand  therefor,
      unless  it is shown that such failure is due to reasonable cause and not
      due to willful neglect, there shall be added to the amount of tax stated
      in such notice and demand one-half of one percent of  such  tax  if  the
      failure  is  not for more than one month, with an additional one-half of
    
      one percent for each additional month or fraction thereof  during  which
      such  failure  continues,  not  exceeding  twenty-five  percent  in  the
      aggregate. For the purpose of computing the addition for any month,  the
      amount  of  tax  stated in the notice and demand shall be reduced by the
      amount of any part of the tax which is paid before the beginning of such
      month.
        * (4) Limitations on additions.
        (A) With respect to any return,  the  amount  of  the  addition  under
      paragraph  one of this subdivision shall be reduced by the amount of the
      addition under paragraph two of this subdivision for any month to  which
      an  addition  applies  under  both  paragraphs  one and two. In any case
      described in subparagraph (B) of paragraph one of this subdivision,  the
      amount  of  the  addition  under such paragraph one shall not be reduced
      below the amount provided in such subparagraph.
        (B) With respect to any return, the maximum  amount  of  the  addition
      permitted  under paragraph three of this subdivision shall be reduced by
      the amount of the addition  under  paragraph  one  of  this  subdivision
      (determined  without  regard  to subparagraph (B) of such paragraph one)
      which is attributable to the tax for which the notice and demand is made
      and which is not paid within ten days of such notice and demand.
        * NB Amended Ch. 765/85 § 78, language juxtaposed per Ch. 907/85 § 14
        * (c)  Underpayment  due  to  negligence.  (1)  If  any  part  of   an
      underpayment  of  tax  is  due to negligence or intentional disregard of
      this chapter or any rules or regulations hereunder (but  without  intent
      to  defraud),  there  shall  be added to the tax a penalty equal to five
      percent of the underpayment.
        (2) There shall be added  to  the  tax  (in  addition  to  the  amount
      determined  under  paragraph one of this subdivision) an amount equal to
      fifty percent of the interest payable  under  subdivision  (a)  of  this
      section  with  respect  to  the portion of the underpayment described in
      such  paragraph  one  which  is  attributable  to  the   negligence   or
      intentional  disregard referred to in such paragraph one, for the period
      beginning on the last  date  prescribed  by  law  for  payment  of  such
      underpayment  (determined without regard to any extension) and ending on
      the date of the assessment of the tax (or, if earlier, the date  of  the
      payment of the tax).
        * NB Amended Ch. 765/85 § 78, language juxtaposed per Ch. 907/85 § 14
        * (d) Underpayment due to fraud. (1) If any part of an underpayment of
      tax  is due to fraud, there shall be added to the tax a penalty equal to
      fifty percent of the underpayment.
        (2) There shall be added to  the  tax  (in  addition  to  the  penalty
      determined  under  paragraph one of this subdivision) an amount equal to
      fifty percent of the interest payable  under  subdivision  (a)  of  this
      section  with  respect  to  the portion of the underpayment described in
      such paragraph one which  is  attributable  to  fraud,  for  the  period
      beginning  on  the  last  day  prescribed  by  law  for  payment of such
      underpayment (determined without regard to any extension) and ending  on
      the  date  of the assessment of the tax (or, if earlier, the date of the
      payment of the tax).
        (3) The penalty under this subdivision shall be in lieu of  any  other
      addition to tax imposed by subdivision (b) or (c) of this section.
        * NB Amended Ch. 765/85 § 78, language juxtaposed per Ch. 907/85 § 14
        (e)  Additional penalty. Any person who, with fraudulent intent, shall
      fail to pay any tax imposed by this chapter, or to make, render, sign or
      certify any return,  or  to  supply  any  information  within  the  time
      required  by or under this chapter, shall be liable for a penalty of not
      more than one  thousand  dollars,  in  addition  to  any  other  amounts
      required under this chapter to be imposed, assessed and collected by the
    
      commissioner  of  finance.  The  commissioner  of finance shall have the
      power, in his or her discretion, to  waive,  reduce  or  compromise  any
      penalty under this subdivision.
        (f)  The  interest and penalties imposed by this section shall be paid
      and disposed of in the same manner as other revenues from this  chapter.
      Unpaid  interest and penalties may be enforced in the same manner as the
      tax imposed by this chapter.
        (g) (1) Authority to set interest rates. The commissioner  of  finance
      shall set the rate of interest to be paid pursuant to subdivision (a) of
      this section, but if no such rate of interest is set, such rate shall be
      deemed  to  be  set  at  seven and one-half percent per annum. Such rate
      shall be the rate prescribed in paragraph two of  this  subdivision  but
      shall  not  be  less than seven and one-half percent per annum. Any such
      rate set by the commissioner of finance shall apply  to  taxes,  or  any
      portion  thereof,  which  remain  or  become due on or after the date on
      which such rate becomes effective and shall apply only with  respect  to
      interest  computed  or  computable  for  periods  or portions of periods
      occurring in the period in which such rate is in effect.
        (2) General rule. The rate of  interest  set  under  this  subdivision
      shall  be  the  sum of (i) the federal short-term rate as provided under
      paragraph three of this subdivision, plus (ii) seven percentage points.
        (3) Federal short-term rate. For purposes of this subdivision:

      treasury during such month in accordance with subsection (d) of  section
      twelve  hundred  seventy-four  of  the  internal revenue code for use in
      connection with section six  thousand  six  hundred  twenty-one  of  the
      internal  revenue  code.  Any  such rate shall be rounded to the nearest
      full percent (or, if a multiple of one-half of one  percent,  such  rate
      shall be increased to the next highest full percent).
        (B) Period during which rate applies.
        (i)   In   general.   Except  as  provided  in  clause  (ii)  of  this
      subparagraph, the federal short-term rate for the first  month  in  each
      calendar quarter shall apply during the first calendar quarter beginning
      after such month.
        (ii)  Special  rule  for  the  month  of  September,  nineteen hundred
      eighty-nine. The  federal  short-term  rate  for  the  month  of  April,
      nineteen  hundred  eighty-nine  shall  apply with respect to setting the
      rate  of  interest  for  the  month  of  September,   nineteen   hundred
      eighty-nine.
        (4)  Publication  of  interest rate. The commissioner of finance shall
      cause to be published in the city record,  and  give  other  appropriate
      general notice of, the interest rate to be set under this subdivision no
      later  than  twenty days preceding the first day of the calendar quarter
      during which such interest rate applies. The setting and publication  of
      such  interest  rate  shall  not  be  included  within  paragraph (a) of
      subdivision five of section one thousand forty-one of the  city  charter
      relating to the definition of a rule.
        * (h)  Miscellaneous.  (1)  The  certificate  of  the  commissioner of
      finance to the effect that a tax has not been paid or  that  information
      has  not  been supplied pursuant to the provisions of this chapter shall
      be presumptive evidence thereof.

      contrary, if a taxpayer has petitioned  the  tax  appeals  tribunal  for
      administrative  review as provided in section one hundred seventy of the
      charter, the commissioner of finance shall be authorized to  present  to

      or required under the provisions of this chapter may be given by mailing
      the same to the person for whom it is intended in  a  postpaid  envelope
      addressed  to  such person at the address given in the last return filed
      by such person pursuant to  the  provisions  of  this  chapter,  in  any
      application  made  by  such  person, or in the records maintained by the
      taxi and limousine commission, or,  if  no  return  has  been  filed  or
      application  made  or  address  found  in  the  records  of the taxi and
      limousine commission, then to such address as  may  be  obtainable.  The
      mailing  of  such notice shall be presumptive evidence of the receipt of
      the same by the person to whom addressed. Any period of  time  which  is
      determined  according to the provisions of this chapter by the giving of
      notice shall commence to run from the date of mailing of such notice.
        b. The provisions of the civil practice law and rules or any other law
      relative to limitations of time for the enforcement of  a  civil  remedy
      shall  not  apply to any proceeding or action taken by the city to levy,
      appraise, assess, determine or enforce the  collection  of  any  tax  or
      penalty  provided  by  this  chapter.  However,  except in the case of a
      wilfully false or fraudulent return with intent to  evade  the  tax,  no
      assessment  of additional tax shall be made after the expiration of more
      than three years from the date of the  filing  of  a  return;  provided,
      however,  that where no return has been filed as provided by law the tax
      may be assessed at any time.
        c. Where, before the expiration of the period  prescribed  herein  for
      the assessment of an additional tax, a taxpayer has consented in writing
      that  such period be extended, the amount of such additional tax due may
      be determined at any time within such extended  period.  The  period  so
      extended  may be further extended by subsequent consents in writing made
      before the expiration of the extended period.
        d. If any return, claim,  statement,  notice,  application,  or  other
      document  required  to  be  filed,  or  any payment required to be made,
      within a prescribed period or on  or  before  a  prescribed  date  under
      authority of any provision of this chapter is, after such period or such
      date,  delivered  by  United States mail to the commissioner of finance,
      the tax appeals tribunal, bureau, office, officer or person  with  which
      or  with  whom  such document is required to be filed, or to which or to
      whom such payment is required to be made, the date of the United  States
      postmark  stamped  on  the  envelope  shall  be deemed to be the date of
      delivery. This subdivision shall apply only if the postmark  date  falls
      within the prescribed period or on or before the prescribed date for the
      filing  of  such  document,  or  for  making  the payment, including any
      extension granted for such filing or payment, and only if such  document
      or  payment  was  deposited  in  the  mail,  postage  prepaid,  properly
      addressed to the commissioner of  finance,  the  tax  appeals  tribunal,
      bureau,  office,  officer or person with which or with whom the document
      is required to be filed or to which or to whom such payment is  required
      to  be  made.  If any document is sent by United States registered mail,
      such registration shall be prima facie evidence that such  document  was
      delivered  to  the  commissioner  of  finance, the tax appeals tribunal,
      bureau, office, officer or person to which or to whom addressed, and the
      date of registration shall be deemed the postmark date. The commissioner
      of finance and, where relevant, the tax appeals tribunal are  authorized
      to  provide  by  regulation  the  extent  to which the provisions of the
      preceding sentence with respect to prima facie evidence of delivery  and
      the  postmark  date shall apply to certified mail. Except as provided in
      subdivision f of this section, this subdivision shall apply in the  case
      of postmarks not made by the United States postal service only if and to
    
      the  extent  provided  by  regulation of the commissioner of finance or,
      where relevant, the tax appeals tribunal.
        e.  When  the  last  day  prescribed  under  authority of this chapter
      (including any extension of time) for performing  any  act  falls  on  a
      Saturday,  Sunday or legal holiday in the state, the performance of such
      act shall be considered timely if it is performed on the next succeeding
      day which is not a Saturday, Sunday or legal holiday.
        f. (1) Any reference in subdivision d of this section  to  the  United
      States  mail  shall  be treated as including a reference to any delivery
      service designated by the secretary of the treasury of the United States
      pursuant to section seventy-five hundred two  of  the  internal  revenue
      code  and  any  reference  in  subdivision d of this section to a United
      States postmark shall be treated as including a reference  to  any  date
      recorded  or  marked  in  the  manner  described in section seventy-five
      hundred two of the  internal  revenue  code  by  a  designated  delivery
      service.  If the commissioner of finance finds that any delivery service
      designated by such secretary is inadequate for the needs  of  the  city,
      the  commissioner  of finance may withdraw such designation for purposes
      of this title. The commissioner of finance may also designate additional
      delivery services meeting the criteria of section  seventy-five  hundred
      two  of  the  internal  revenue  code for purposes of this title, or may
      withdraw any such designation if the commissioner of finance finds  that
      a  delivery  service  so  designated  is inadequate for the needs of the
      city. Any reference in subdivision d  of  this  section  to  the  United
      States  mail  shall  be treated as including a reference to any delivery
      service designated by the commissioner of finance and any  reference  in
      subdivision  d  of  this  section  to  a United States postmark shall be
      treated as including a reference to any date recorded or marked  in  the
      manner  described  in  section  seventy-five hundred two of the internal
      revenue code by a delivery service designated  by  the  commissioner  of
      finance. Notwithstanding the foregoing, any withdrawal of designation or
      additional  designation  by  the  commissioner  of  finance shall not be
      effective for purposes of service upon the tax appeals tribunal,  unless
      and  until  such  withdrawal of designation or additional designation is
      ratified by the president of the tax appeals tribunal.
        (2) Any equivalent of registered or certified mail designated  by  the
      United  States secretary of the treasury, or as may be designated by the
      commissioner of finance pursuant to  the  same  criteria  used  by  such
      secretary for such designations pursuant to section seventy-five hundred
      two  of  the internal revenue code, shall be included within the meaning
      of registered or certified  mail  as  used  in  subdivision  d  of  this
      section.  If  the  commissioner  of finance finds that any equivalent of
      registered or  certified  mail  designated  by  such  secretary  or  the
      commissioner  of  finance  is  inadequate for the needs of the city, the
      commissioner of finance may withdraw such designation  for  purposes  of
      this title. Notwithstanding the foregoing, any withdrawal of designation
      or  additional  designation  by the commissioner of finance shall not be
      effective for purposes of service upon the tax appeals tribunal,  unless
      and  until  such  withdrawal of designation or additional designation is
      ratified by the president of the tax appeals tribunal.
