Section 11-1916 ::    
        
     
        §  11-1916  Returns  and payment of tax. (a) General. On or before the
      fifteenth day of the fourth month following the  close  of  the  taxable
      year,  every  person subject to the tax shall make and file a return and
      any balance of the tax shown due on the face of  such  return  shall  be
      paid  therewith.  The  commissioner  may, by regulation, provide for the
      filing of returns and payment of the tax at such other times  as  he  or
      she  deems  necessary  for  the  proper enforcement of this chapter. The
      commissioner may also provide by regulation that  any  return  otherwise
      required  to  be  made  and  filed under this chapter by any nonresident
      individual need not be made and filed  if  such  nonresident  individual
      had,  during  the  taxable year to which the return would relate, no net
      earnings from self-employment within the city. Any  regulation  allowing
      such  waiver  of  return  may  provide for additional limitations on and
      conditions and prerequisites to the privilege of not filing a return.
        (b) Decedents. The return for any deceased individual  shall  be  made
      and filed by his or her executor, administrator, or other person charged
      with  his  or  her  property.  If  a final return of a decedent is for a
      fractional part of a year, the due date of  such  return  shall  be  the
      fifteenth   day   of  the  fourth  month  following  the  close  of  the
      twelve-month period which began with the first day  of  such  fractional
      part of the year.
        (c)  Individuals  under a disability. The return for an individual who
      is unable to make a return by reason of  minority  or  other  disability
      shall  be made and filed by his or her guardian, committee, fiduciary or
      other person charged with the care of his  or  her  person  or  property
      (other  than  a  receiver  in  possession  of  only a part of his or her
      property), or by his or her duly authorized agent.
        (d) Estates and trust. The return for an estate or trust shall be made
      and filed by the fiduciary.
        (e) Joint fiduciaries. If two or more fiduciaries are acting  jointly,
      the return may be made by any one of them.
        (f)  Cross  reference.  For  provisions  as  to information returns by
      partnerships, employers and other persons, see section 11-1921  of  this
      subchapter.

Section 11-1917 ::    
        
     
        §  11-1917  Time and place for filing returns and paying tax. A person
      required to make and file a return under  this  chapter  shall,  without
      assessment,   notice   or  demand,  pay  any  tax  due  thereon  to  the
      commissioner on  or  before  the  date  fixed  for  filing  such  return
      (determined  without  regard  to  any  extension  of time for filing the
      return). The commissioner shall prescribe by regulation  the  place  for
      filing  any  return,  statement,  or other document required pursuant to
      this chapter and for payment of any tax.
    
    
    
    
    
    
    

Section 11-1918

Section 11-1918 ::    
        
     
        §  11-1918  Signing  of  returns and other documents. (a) General. Any
      return, statement or other document required to be made pursuant to this
      chapter shall be signed in accordance with regulations  or  instructions
      prescribed  by  the  commissioner. The fact that an individual's name is
      signed to a return, statement, or other document, shall be  prima  facie
      evidence  for  all purposes that the return, statement or other document
      was actually signed by such individual.
        (b) Partnerships. Any return, statement or other document required  of
      a  partnership  shall be signed by one or more partners. The fact that a
      partner's name is signed to a  return,  statement,  or  other  document,
      shall  be  prima  facie  evidence  for all purposes that such partner is
      authorized to sign on behalf of the partnership.
        (c) Certifications. The making or filing of any return,  statement  or
      other  document or copy thereof required to be made or filed pursuant to
      this chapter, including a copy of a federal return, shall  constitute  a
      certification  by  the person making or filing such return, statement or
      other document or copy thereof that the statements contained therein are
      true and that any copy filed is a true copy.
    
    
    
    
    
    
    

Section 11-1919
---------------

Section 11-1919 ::    
        
     
        §  11-1919  Change of residence status during year. (a) General. If an
      individual changes his or her status during his or her taxable year from
      resident to nonresident, or from nonresident  to  resident,  he  or  she
      shall  file a return as a nonresident for the portion of the year during
      which he or she is a nonresident if he or she  is  subject  to  the  tax
      imposed  by  this chapter or, if not subject to such tax, an information
      return for the portion  of  the  year  during  which  he  or  she  is  a
      nonresident,   subject  to  such  exceptions  as  the  commissioner  may
      prescribe by regulation. Such information return shall  be  due  at  the
      same  time as the return required by chapter seventeen of this title for
      the portion of the year during which such individual is a resident.
        (b) City taxable wages  and  net  earnings  from  self-employment  for
      portion  of year individual is a nonresident. The city taxable wages and
      net earnings from self-employment for the portion  of  the  year  during
      which he or she is a nonresident shall be determined, except as provided
      in  subdivision (c) of this section, under this chapter as if his or her
      taxable year for federal income tax purposes were limited to the  period
      of his or her nonresident status.
        (c)  Special  accruals. (1) If an individual changes his or her status
      from resident to nonresident, he or she shall, regardless of his or  her
      method  of  accounting, accrue for the portion of the taxable year prior
      to such change of status any items of income, gain,  loss  or  deduction
      accruing  prior  to  the  change  of  status,  if not otherwise properly
      includible (whether or not because  of  an  election  to  report  on  an
      installment  basis) or allowable for city earnings tax purposes for such
      portion of the taxable year for a prior taxable  year.  The  amounts  of
      such  accrued  items  shall  be determined as if such accrued items were
      includible or allowable for federal self-employment tax purposes.
        (2) If an individual changes his or her  status  from  nonresident  to
      resident,  he  or  she  shall,  regardless  of  his  or  her  method  of
      accounting, accrue for the portion of the taxable  year  prior  to  such
      change  of  status any items of income, gain, loss or deduction accruing
      prior to the change of  status  any  items  of  income,  gain,  loss  or
      deduction  accruing  prior  to  the  change  of status, if not otherwise
      properly includible (whether or not because of an election to report  on
      an  installment  basis)  or  allowable  for  federal self-employment tax
      purposes for such portion of the taxable year or for prior taxable year.
      The amounts of such accrued items shall be determined  if  such  accrued
      items  were  includible  or  allowable  for  federal self-employment tax
      purposes.
        (3) No item of income, gain, loss or deduction which is accrued  under
      this  subdivision  shall  be  taken  into  account  in  determining city
      adjusted wages earned, or net earnings from self-employment, within  the
      city, for any subsequent taxable period.
        (4)  Where  an  individual  changes his or her status from resident to
      nonresident, the accruals under this subdivision shall not  be  required
      if  the  individual files with the commissioner a bond or other security
      acceptable to  the  commissioner,  conditioned  upon  the  inclusion  of
      amounts  accruable  under this subdivision in city adjusted gross income
      under chapter seventeen of this title for one or more subsequent taxable
      years as if the individual has not changed his or her  resident  status.
      In  such  event,  the  tax  under  this  chapter shall not apply to such
      amounts.
        (d) Prorations. Where an individual changes his or her  status  during
      his or her taxable year from resident to nonresident or from nonresident
      to  resident,  the  exclusion allowable under subdivision (b) of section
      11-1902 of this chapter shall be  prorated,  under  regulations  of  the
    
      commissioner,  to reflect the portions of the entire taxable year during
      which the individual was a resident and a nonresident.
    
    
    
    
    
    
    

Section 11-1920
---------------

Section 11-1920 ::    
        
     
        § 11-1920 Extension of time. (a) General. The commissioner may grant a
      reasonable extension of time for payment of tax or estimated tax (or any
      installment),  or  for  filing  any return, statement, or other document
      required pursuant to this chapter, on such terms and conditions as he or
      she may require. Except for a taxpayer who is outside the United  States
      or  who  intends  to  claim nonresident status pursuant to subparagraphs
      (i), (ii) and (iii) of paragraph  one  of  subdivision  (h)  of  section
      11-1901  of  this  chapter,  no  such  extension  for filing any return,
      statement or other document, shall exceed six months.
        (b) Furnishing of security. If any extension of time  is  granted  for
      payment  of any amount of tax, the commissioner may require the taxpayer
      to furnish a bond or other security in an amount not exceeding twice the
      amount for which the extension of time for payment is granted,  on  such
      terms and conditions as the commissioner may require.
    
    
    
    
    
    
    

Section 11-1921

Section 11-1921 ::    
        
     
        §  11-1921  Requirements  concerning  returns,  notices,  records  and
      statements. (a) General. The commissioner may prescribe  regulations  as
      to  the  keeping  of  records,  the  content  and  form  of  returns and
      statements, and the filing of copies of federal income tax  returns  and
      determinations.  The  commissioner may require any person, by regulation
      or notice served upon such person, to make  such  returns,  render  such
      statements,   or  keep  such  records,  as  the  commissioner  may  deem
      sufficient to show whether or not  such  person  is  liable  under  this
      chapter for tax or for collection of tax.
        (b)  Partnerships.  Every  partnership  doing business in the city and
      having no partners who are residents shall make a return for the taxable
      year setting forth all items of income, gain,  loss  and  deduction  and
      such  other pertinent information as the commissioner may by regulations
      and instructions prescribe. Such return shall be filed on or before  the
      fifteenth  day  of  the fourth month following the close of each taxable
      year. For purposes of this subdivision, "taxable  year"  means  year  or
      period  which  would  be  a  taxable  year of the partnership if it were
      subject to tax under this chapter.
        (c) Information at source. The commissioner may prescribe  regulations
      and  instructions  requiring returns of information to be made and filed
      on or before February twenty-eighth of each year as to  the  payment  or
      crediting in any calendar year of amounts of six hundred dollars or more
      to  any taxpayer under this chapter. Such returns may be required of any
      person, including lessees or mortgagors of real  or  personal  property,
      fiduciaries, employers, and all officers and employees of this state, or
      any municipal corporation or political subdivision of this state, having
      the  control,  receipt, custody, disposal or payment of interest, rents,
      salaries,  wages,  premiums,  annuities,  compensations,  remunerations,
      emoluments  or  other  fixed  or  determinable gains, profits or income,
      except interest coupons payable to bearer. A duplicate of the  statement
      as  to tax withheld on wages, required to be furnished by an employer to
      an employee, shall constitute the return of information required  to  be
      made under this section with respect to such wages.
        (d)  Notice of qualification as receiver, etc. Every receiver, trustee
      in  bankruptcy,  assignee  for  benefit  of  creditors,  or  other  like
      fiduciary  shall give notice of his or her qualifications as such to the
      commissioner, as may be required by regulation.

Section 11-1922 ::    
        
     
        §  11-1922  Report  of  change  in  federal  or New York state taxable
      income.  If the amount of a taxpayer's federal or New York state taxable
      income or self-employment income reported on his or her federal  or  New
      York  state  tax  return for any taxable year is changed or corrected by
      the United States  internal  revenue  service  or  the  New  York  state
      commissioner of taxation and finance or other competent authority, or as
      the  result  of  a  renegotiation  of a contract or subcontract with the
      United States or New York state or if a taxpayer, pursuant to subsection
      (d) of section six thousand two hundred thirteen of the internal revenue
      code, executes a notice  of  waiver  of  the  restrictions  provided  in
      subsection (a) of said section or if a taxpayer, pursuant to subdivision
      (f)  of  section six hundred eighty-one of the tax law executes a notice
      of waiver of the  restrictions  provided  in  subdivision  (c)  of  said
      section,  or  if  any  tax on self-employment income in addition to that
      shown on his or her return is assessed, the taxpayer shall  report  such
      change or correction in federal or New York state taxable income or such
      execution of such notice of waiver or such assessment and the changes or
      corrections  of  his  or her federal or New York state taxable income or
      self-employment income on which it is based, within  ninety  days  after
      the final determination of such change, correction, or renegotiation, or
      such execution of such notice of waiver or the making of such assessment
      as  otherwise  required  by  the  commissioner,  and  shall  concede the
      accuracy of such determination or state wherein  it  is  erroneous.  Any
      taxpayer  filing  an  amended  federal  or  New  York  state  income  or
      self-employment income tax return shall also  file  within  ninety  days
      thereafter  an  amended  return  under this chapter, and shall give such
      information as the commissioner may require.  The  commissioner  may  by
      regulation prescribe such exceptions to the requirements of this section
      as  he  or  she deems appropriate. For purposes of this section, (i) the
      term "taxpayer" shall include a partnership having  any  income  derived
      from  city  sources, and (ii) the term "federal income tax return" shall
      include the returns  of  income  required  under  section  six  thousand
      thirty-one of the internal revenue code. Reports made under this section
      by  a  partnership shall indicate the portion of the change in each item
      of income, gain, loss or deduction allocable to each partner  and  shall
      set  forth  such identifying information with respect to such partner as
      may be prescribed by the commissioner.
