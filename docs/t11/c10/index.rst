        § 11-1001 Legislative findings. It is hereby declared that: In certain
      areas  of  the  city  of  New York there exist unsanitary or substandard
      housing  conditions  owing  to   overcrowding   and   concentration   of
      population,  improper  planning, excessive land coverage, lack of proper
      light, air and space, unsanitary design  and  arrangement,  or  lack  of
      proper  sanitary  facilities; there is not an adequate supply of decent,
      safe and sanitary dwelling accommodations for  persons  of  low  income;
      these  conditions  cause an increase and spread of disease and crime and
      constitute a menace to the health, safety, morals, welfare  and  comfort
      of  the  citizens  of  the  state,  and  impair  economic  values; these
      conditions cannot be remedied  by  the  ordinary  operation  of  private
      enterprise; the clearance, replanning and reconstruction of the areas in
      which  unsanitary  or  substandard  housing  conditions  exist  and  the
      providing of decent, safe and sanitary dwelling accommodations  in  such
      areas  and  elsewhere  for  persons  of  low  income are public uses and
      purposes for which public  money  may  be  spent  and  private  property
      acquired;  therefore  the  necessity  in  the  public  interest  for the
      provisions hereinafter enacted  is  hereby  declared,  as  a  matter  of
      legislative determination.

      commissioner  of finance, and an undertaking filed with the commissioner
      of finance, in such amount and with such sureties as a  justice  of  the

      erroneously, illegally or unconstitutionally collected by or paid to him
      or her, under protest in  writing,  stating  in  detail  the  ground  or
      grounds  of  the  protest,  if application therefor shall be made to the
      commissioner of finance within one year from the  payment  thereof.  For
      like  cause  and  within  the  same  period  a refund may be made on the
      initiative of the commissioner of finance. Whenever a refund is made the
      commissioner of finance shall state  his  or  her  reasons  therefor  in
      writing.  A person shall not be entitled to a hearing in connection with
      any application for a refund if he or she has  already  been  given  the
      opportunity of a hearing as provided in section 11-1009 of this chapter.
      No  refund  shall  be  made  of  a  tax  or  penalty  paid pursuant to a
      determination of the commissioner of  finance  as  provided  in  section
      11-1009  of  this  chapter,  unless the commissioner of finance, after a
      hearing as in said section provided, or of his or her own motion,  shall
      have  reduced the tax or penalty, or it shall have been established in a
      proceeding under article seventy-eight of the  civil  practice  law  and
      rules  that such determination was erroneous, illegal, unconstitutional,
      or otherwise improper, in which event a refund with  interest  shall  be
      made   as  provided  upon  the  determination  of  such  proceeding.  An
      application for a refund made as herein  provided  shall  be  deemed  an
      application  for  a revision of any tax or penalty complained of and the
      commissioner of finance may receive evidence with respect thereto. After
      making his or her determination the commissioner of finance  shall  give
      notice  thereof to the person interested who shall be entitled to review
      such determination by a proceeding under article  seventy-eight  of  the
      civil practice law and rules if application to the supreme court be made
      therefor  within thirty days after such determination and an undertaking
      shall first be filed with the commissioner of finance in such amount and
      with such sureties as a justice of the supreme court shall  approve,  to
      the  effect  that  if  such order be dismissed or the tax confirmed, the
      applicant for the order will pay all costs and charges which may  accrue
      in the prosecution of the certiorari proceeding.

Section 11-1013
---------------

Section 11-1013 ::    
        
     
        §  11-1013  Proceeding  to recover tax. a. The commissioner of finance
      may issue  a  warrant  directed  to  any  officer  or  employee  of  the
      department  of  finance  commanding him or her to levy upon and sell the
      real and personal property of the person from whom the tax  is  due  for
      the  payment  of  the  amount  thereof,  with penalties, and the cost of
      executing the warrants, and to return such warrant to  the  commissioner
      of  finance  and  to  pay  to  him  or her the money collected by virtue
      thereof, and in the execution thereof such  officer  or  employee  shall
      have  all the powers conferred by law upon sheriffs, but he or she shall
      be entitled to no fee or compensation in excess of the  actual  expenses
      paid  in  the  performance  of  such  duty. If a warrant is returned not
      satisfied in full, the commissioner of finance may  from  time  to  time
      issue  new warrants and shall also have the same remedies to enforce the
      amount due hereunder as if the city had recovered judgment therefor  and
      the  execution  thereon  had  been returned not satisfied. A copy of any
      warrant issued may be filed with the county clerk in any of the counties
      of the city of New York and thereupon such  clerk  shall  enter  in  the
      judgment  docket the name of the person mentioned in the warrant and the
      amount of the tax and penalty for which the warrant is  issued  and  the
      date  when  such  copy is filed. Thereupon the amount of such warrant so
      docketed shall become a lien upon the title to and interest in the  real
      and personal property of the person against whom the warrant is issued.
        b.  As  an  additional or alternate remedy the commissioner of finance
      may request the corporation counsel to bring an action in  the  name  of
      the  city  to  enforce  payment of a tax or penalty which any person has
      failed to pay.
        c. The commissioner of finance, if he or she finds that the  interests
      of the city will not thereby be jeopardized, and upon such conditions as
      the  commissioner  of finance may require, may release any property from
      the lien of any  warrant  or  vacate  such  warrant  for  unpaid  taxes,
      additions to tax, penalties and interest filed pursuant to subdivision a
      of  this  section,  and  such  release or vacating of the warrant may be
      recorded in the office of any recording officer in  which  such  warrant
      has been filed. The clerk shall thereupon cancel and discharge as of the
      original date of docketing the vacated warrant.

      such  person  pursuant to the provisions of this chapter or if no return
      has been filed then to such address as may be obtainable. The mailing of
      such notice shall be presumptive evidence of the receipt of the same  by
      the  person  to  whom  addressed. Any period of time which is determined
      according to the provisions of this chapter  by  the  giving  of  notice
      shall commence to run from the date of mailing of such notice.
        b.  The  provisions  of  the  civil practice law and rules relative to
      limitations of time for the enforcement of  a  civil  remedy  shall  not
      apply  to  any proceeding or action by the city taken to levy, appraise,
      assess, determine or enforce  the  collection  of  any  tax  or  penalty
      provided by this chapter.

      times  the  amount  of the tax due, plus five per centum of such tax for
      each month of  delay  or  fraction  thereof,  but  the  commissioner  of
      finance, if satisfied that the delay was excusable, may remit all or any
      part  of  such penalty, but not interest. Penalties shall be paid to the
      commissioner of finance and disposed of in the manner as other  receipts
      under  this chapter. Unpaid penalties may be enforced in the same manner
      as the tax imposed by this chapter.
        b. Any person filing or causing to be filed any  return,  certificate,
      affidavit  or statement required or authorized by this chapter, which is
      wilfully false and any person who shall fail to  file  a  return  or  to
      furnish a statement or other information as required under this chapter,
      shall  be  guilty of a misdemeanor, punishment for which shall be a fine
      of not more than one thousand dollars or imprisonment for not more  than
      one  year,  or  both  such  fine  and imprisonment. A certificate of the
      commissioner of finance to the effect that a tax has not been paid, that
      a return has not been filed, or that information has not  been  supplied
      pursuant  to  the  provisions  of  this  chapter,  shall  be prima facie
      evidence thereof.

Section 11-1016 ::    
        
     
        §  11-1016  General  powers  of  the  commissioner  of finance. In the
      administration  of  this  chapter,  the  commissioner  of   finance   is
      authorized to:
        1.  Make  and  publish  reasonable  rules  and  regulations  as may be
      necessary  for  the  exercise  of  the  commissioner's  powers  and  the
      performance of the commissioner's duties under this chapter.
        2. Assess the tax authorized to be imposed under this chapter.
        3. Subpoena and require the attendance of witnesses and the production
      of  books, papers and other documents, and to take testimony and proofs,
      under oath, with  reference  to  any  matter  within  the  line  of  the
      commissioner's official duty under this chapter.
        4.  Delegate  the  commissioner's  functions  hereunder  to  a  deputy
      commissioner of finance or other employee or employees of the department
      of finance.
        5. Prescribe methods for determining the rental  values  of  premises,

      the commissioner  of  finance,  upon  his  or  her  request,  containing
      information as to the name of each occupant and rental value of each for
      the occupation of such premises.
        7.  Nothing  contained  in  section  11-1017 of this chapter or in any
      other provision  of  this  chapter  shall  be  construed  to  limit  the
      authority  of the commissioner of finance, hereby authorized, to furnish
      any information, whether or not  contained  in  a  return,  to  the  tax
      commission  or  any other agency or department of the state of New York,
      or to the treasury department of the United States, or to any agency  of
      the  city  of New York, or to the district attorney of any county within

Section 11-1017 ::    
        
     
        §  11-1017  Returns  to  be secret. Except in accordance with judicial
      order, or upon subpoena issued by a court of competent jurisdiction,  it
      shall  be  unlawful  for  the  commissioner of finance or any officer or
      employee of the city to  divulge  or  make  known  in  any  manner,  any
      information contained in any return required under this chapter. Nothing
      herein  shall  be  construed to prohibit the delivery to a taxpayer of a
      certified copy of any return filed by the taxpayer, nor to prohibit  the
      publication of statistics so classified as to prevent the identification
      of  particular  returns, or the inspection by the corporation counsel of
      the return to any taxpayer who shall bring action or proceeding  to  set
      aside  or  review  the  tax  based thereon, or against whom an action or
      proceeding has been instituted or is contemplated for the collection  of
      a  tax  or  penalty.  Returns  shall  be  preserved  for three years and
      thereafter  until  the  commissioner  of  finance  orders  them  to   be
      destroyed.
    
    
    
    
    
    
    

Section 11-1018

Section 11-1018 ::    
        
     
        §  11-1018  Disposition of revenue. All revenues and moneys heretofore
      or hereafter collected  resulting  from  the  imposition  of  taxes  and
      penalties  imposed  by  this  chapter  shall  be  deposited  in the city
      treasury, and credited to a separate account. During each  fiscal  year,
      an  amount  not in excess of the amount of the subsidies to be made, and
      the amount of indebtedness incurred  for  low  rent  or  slum  clearance
      projects  to  be  paid, during such fiscal year shall be charged to such
      account and credited to the general fund. No  other  payments  shall  be
      charged  to  such  an account. The mayor may contract to make capital or
      periodic subsidies to the New York city housing authority in  aid  of  a
      low  rent  project,  or  may  incur  indebtedness  for  a  low rent slum
      clearance project, but such periodic subsidies shall not  be  contracted
      for  a  period  longer than the life of such project and in no event for
      more than fifty years. If the amount of any such periodic subsidy  shall
      be  equal  to  or  greater than the interest on and the amounts required
      annually for the payment of the indebtedness contracted by the authority
      on account of such project in each year, such contract shall  constitute
      a  guarantee  of the principal of and the interest on such indebtedness,
      and such contract and the payments thereunder  may  be  pledged  by  the
      authority  as  security  in  addition  to  all  other security which the
      authority may  give  for  such  bonds.  No  such  contract  or  periodic
      subsidies  shall be made until the plan for such project shall have been
      approved in the manner provided by the public housing law.

Section 11-1019 ::    
        
     
        §  11-1019 Application; construction. If any provision of this chapter
      shall be adjudged by any court of competent jurisdiction to be  invalid,
      such  judgment  shall  not  affect,  impair  or invalidate the remainder
      thereof, but shall  be  confined  in  its  operation  to  the  provision
      directly  involved  in the controversy in which such judgment shall have
      been rendered. This chapter shall be construed in  conformity  with  the
      public housing law.
