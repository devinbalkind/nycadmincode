      certificate  of  authority  as  required  by chapter twenty-five of this
      title, or willfully assigns or transfers such certificate of  authority,
      shall be guilty of a misdemeanor, provided, however, that the provisions
      of  this  subdivision  shall  not  apply  to  a  failure  to surrender a
      certificate of authority which  is  required  to  be  surrendered  where
      business never commenced.
        (b)  Any  person  who  willfully  fails  to  charge separately the tax
      imposed under chapter twenty-five or willfully fails to state  such  tax
      separately  on  any  bill,  statement,  memorandum  or receipt issued or

Section 11-4021 ::    
        
     
        §  11-4021 Seizure and forfeiture of cigarettes. (a) Whenever a police
      officer designated in section 1.20 of the criminal procedure  law  or  a
      peace  officer  designated  in  subdivision five of section 2.10 of such
      law,  acting  pursuant  to  his  special  duties,  shall  discover   any
      cigarettes  subject  to  any  tax  provided  by chapter thirteen of this
      title, and upon which the tax has  not  been  paid  or  the  stamps  not
      affixed  as  required  by  such  chapter, they are hereby authorized and
      empowered forthwith to seize and take  possession  of  such  cigarettes,
      together  with  any vending machine or receptacle in which they are held
      for sale. Such cigarettes, vending machine or  receptacle  seized  by  a
      police  officer  or  such  peace  officer  shall  be  turned over to the
      commissioner of finance.
        (b) The seized cigarettes and any vending machine or receptacle seized
      therewith, but not the  money  contained  in  such  vending  machine  or
      receptacle  shall  thereupon be forfeited to the city, unless the person
      from whom the seizure is made, or the owner of such  seized  cigarettes,
      vending machine or receptacle, or any other person having an interest in
      such  property,  shall  within  ten  days  of such seizure, apply to the
      commissioner of finance for a hearing to determine the propriety of  the
      seizure,  or  unless the commissioner of finance shall on his own motion
      release the seized cigarettes, vending machine or receptacle. After such
      hearing the commissioner of finance shall give notice of his decision to
      the petitioner. The decision of the commissioner shall be reviewable for
      error, illegality, unconstitutionality or any other reason whatsoever by
      a proceeding under article seventy-eight of the civil practice  law  and
      rules if application therefor is made to the supreme court within thirty
      days  after  the  giving of the notice of such decision. Such proceeding
      shall not be instituted unless there  shall  first  be  filed  with  the
      commissioner  of  finance  an  undertaking,  issued  by a surety company
      authorized to transact business in New York state and  approved  by  the
      superintendent  of  insurance  of  New  York  state  as  to solvency and
      responsibility, in such amount as a justice of the supreme  court  shall
      approve,  to  the  effect  that  if such proceeding be dismissed, or the
      seizure confirmed, the petitioner will pay all costs and  charges  which
      may accrue in the prosecution of the proceeding.
        (c)  The  commissioner  of finance may, within a reasonable time after
      the forfeiture to the city of such vending machines or receptacles, upon
      publication of a notice to such effect  for  at  least  five  successive
      days,  in  a  newspaper  published  or circulated in the city, sell such
      forfeited vending machines or receptacles at public  sale  and  pay  the
      proceeds  into  the  treasury  of  the city to the credit of the general
      fund. Such seized vending machines or receptacles may be sold  prior  to
      forfeiture  if  the  owner  of the seized property consents to the sale.
      Notwithstanding any other provision of this section, the commissioner of
      finance may enter into an agreement with the  state  tax  commission  to
      provide  for  the disposition between the city and state of the proceeds
      from any such sale. The commissioner of finance may  also  transfer  any
      seized cigarettes to the state for destruction. All cigarettes forfeited
      to  the  state  shall be destroyed or used for law enforcement purposes,
      except that cigarettes that violate,  or  are  suspected  of  violating,
      federal  trademark  laws  or  import  laws  shall  not  be  used for law
      enforcement purposes. If the commissioner determines the cigarettes  may
      not  be  used  for law enforcement purposes, the commissioner of finance
      must, within a reasonable time after the forfeiture to the city of  such
      cigarettes,  upon  publication  of  a notice to such effect for at least
      five successive days, prior to destruction, in a newspaper published  or
      circulated   in  the  city,  destroy  such  forfeited  cigarettes.  Such
      commissioner may, prior to any destruction  of  cigarettes,  permit  the
    
      true  holder  of  the trademark rights in the cigarettes to inspect such
      forfeited cigarettes in order to assist in any  investigation  regarding
      such cigarettes.
        (d)  In  the  alternative,  the commissioner of finance, on reasonable
      notice by mail or otherwise,  may  permit  the  person  from  whom  said
      cigarettes  were  seized  to redeem the said cigarettes, and any vending
      machine or receptacle seized therewith, or may permit the owner  of  any
      such  cigarettes,  vending  machine or receptacle to redeem the same, by
      the payment of the tax due, plus a penalty  of  fifty  percent  thereof,
      plus  interest  on  the  amount  of  tax  due for each month or fraction
      thereof after such tax became due  (determined  without  regard  to  any
      extension  of  time  for  filing or paying) at the rate applicable under
      subdivision d of section 11-1317 of this title and the costs incurred in
      such proceeding, which  total  payment  shall  not  be  less  than  five
      dollars;  provided,  however,  that  such seizure and sale or redemption
      shall not be deemed to relieve any  person  from  fine  or  imprisonment
      provided  for  in  this  chapter for violation of any provisions of this
      chapter or chapter thirteen of this title.
        (e) In the alternative, the commissioner of finance may dispose of any
      cigarettes seized pursuant to this section, except those  that  violate,
      or are suspected of violating, federal trademark laws or import laws, by
      transferring  them to the department of correction for sale to or use by
      inmates in such institutions.

        (4) The owner  or  other  person  lawfully  entitled  to  reclaim  the
      devices, items or goods described in paragraph three of this subdivision
      shall  reclaim such devices, items or goods. If such owner or such other
      person does not reclaim such devices, items or goods within ninety  days

      cigarettes sold or possessed by unlicensed retail or  wholesale  dealers
      and  flavored tobacco products. (a) Whenever a police officer designated

      such cigarettes are sold, offered for sale or possessed by a  person  in
      violation  of section 11-1303, 17-703 or 20-202 of this code, or (2) any

      vending  machine  or  receptacle  may be sold prior to forfeiture if the
      owner of the  seized  property  consents  to  the  sale.  Cigarettes  or
      flavored  tobacco product forfeited to the city under this section shall
      be  destroyed  or  used  for  law  enforcement  purposes,  except   that
      cigarettes   that  violate,  or  are  suspected  of  violating,  federal
      trademark laws or import laws shall not  be  used  for  law  enforcement
      purposes.  If the commissioner determines the cigarettes forfeited under
      this  section  may  not  be  used  for  law  enforcement  purposes,  the
      commissioner  of  finance  must,  within  a  reasonable  time  after the
      forfeiture to the city of such cigarettes, upon publication of a  notice
      to  such effect for at least five successive days, prior to destruction,
      in a newspaper  published  or  circulated  in  the  city,  destroy  such
      forfeited cigarettes.
        (d)  In  the  alternative,  the commissioner of finance, on reasonable
      notice by mail or otherwise, may permit the person from whom  a  seizure
      of  cigarettes  or flavored tobacco product under this section was made,
      to redeem any vending machine or receptacle seized with such  cigarettes
    
      or flavored tobacco product, or may permit the owner of any such vending
      machine  or receptacle to redeem the same, upon the payment of any civil

      subchapter one of chapter two of title twenty of this code and the costs
      incurred in such proceeding.
