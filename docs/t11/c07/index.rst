      May thirty-first, nineteen hundred seventy, every tenant shall pay a tax
      of two and one-half per centum of his or her base rent for such tax year

      of  five  per centum of his or her base rent for such tax year where his
      or her base rent is in excess of twenty-five hundred dollars per year or
      where his or her base rent is for a period of less  than  one  year  and
      would  exceed  twenty-five  hundred dollars a year if it were paid on an
      equivalent basis for an entire year.
        (2) For each tax year commencing on or  after,  June  first,  nineteen
      hundred  seventy, every tenant shall pay a tax at the rates shown in the
      following tables:

      thirty-first,    nineteen   hundred   seventy-seven   and   ending   May
      thirty-first, nineteen hundred eighty, the tax shall be imposed at rates
      equal to ninety percent of the rates shown in the foregoing table.

      the entire year.
        b.    Nothing  contained  in  this  chapter shall be deemed to require

      applicable to so much of the rent as is ascribable  to  the  portion  of

      ascribable to so much of such premises as is used  as  taxable  premises
      does  not exceed fifty dollars a month, such rent shall be excluded from
      such tenant's base rent.  Nothing contained in this subdivision shall be
      construed as indicating an intent to exclude any base rent from the  tax
      imposed  by  this  chapter  merely  because  it  is  paid  as part of an
      undivided rent for premises which are only  partially  used  as  taxable
      premises.

      all other taxes including the public housing tax imposed by chapter  ten

      deducting rents received by him or her for another taxable  premises  of
      which he or she is also a tenant.

Section 11-703 ::    
        
     
        ยง  11-703  Presumptions and burden of proof. a. For the purpose of the
      proper administration of this chapter and to prevent evasion of the  tax
      hereby  imposed  it  shall  be  presumed  that  all premises are taxable
      premises and that all rent paid or required to be paid by  a  tenant  is
      base  rent  until the contrary is established, and the burden of proving
      that such presumptive base rent or any portion thereof is  not  included
      in  the  measure  of  the  tax  imposed  by this chapter shall be on the
      tenant.
        b. Where a tenant uses premises both for residential purposes  and  as
      taxable  premises and the tenant pays an undivided rent for the premises
      so used, it shall be conclusively presumed against such tenant that  the
      rent  ascribable  to  so  much  of  such  premises as is used as taxable
      premises shall be the amount which such tenant deducts as rent for  such
      premises  in  determining the tenant's federal income tax (as reduced by
      any disallowance of such deduction which is not being  contested)  which
      is fairly attributable to the tax period or tax year.

      tenant who uses taxable premises for the production and performance of a
      theatrical work shall be exempt from the tax  imposed  by  this  chapter
      with respect to the rent paid for such taxable premises for a period not

      subparagraph  shall  not  apply to any theatrical work the production of
      which commenced prior to June first, nineteen hundred ninety-five.
        (ii)  For purposes of this paragraph, the term "theatrical work" shall

        f. (1) A tenant who is an  eligible  business  and  has  obtained  the
      certifications  required  by paragraph four of this subdivision shall be
      permitted to reduce his or her base  rent  for  particular  premises  to
      which  he  or  she  has relocated by an amount determined by multiplying
      such base rent by a fraction the numerator of which  is  the  number  of
      eligible  aggregate  employment  shares  maintained  by such tenant with
      respect to such premises in the tax year for which  such  tenant  claims
      the  reduction  and  the  denominator  of which is a number equal to the
      number of aggregate employment shares maintained by such tenant in  such
      premises  in  the  tax  year  for which such tenant claims the reduction
      allowed by this subdivision, provided, however,  that  such  denominator
      shall  not  exceed  the  highest  number  of aggregate employment shares
      maintained by such tenant in such premises  in  any  of  the  tax  years
      described  below  which  commence  prior to or concurrently with the tax
      year for  which  such  tenant  claims  the  reduction  allowed  by  this
      subdivision: (i) the tax year during which such tenant relocates to such

      to such premises and for any of the twelve  immediately  succeeding  tax
      years  during  which  the tenant maintains eligible aggregate employment
      shares with respect to such  premises,  provided,  however,  that  there
      shall be no such reduction with respect to base rent for any part of the
      tax  year  preceding  the  date  of  relocation  to  such  premises, and
      provided, further, however, in the twelfth  succeeding  tax  year  there
      shall  be  a  reduction  only  with  respect to base rent for the period
      (commencing on the first day of such tax year) equal to  the  difference
      between  the  total number of days in the tax year of relocation and the
      number of days in such  tax  year  of  relocation  commencing  with  and
      following  the  date  of  relocation,  and provided, further, that there
      shall be no such reduction with respect  to  premises  used  for  retail
      activity or hotel services.
        (2)  (i)  For purposes of this subdivision, the terms "eligible area,"
      "eligible aggregate employment shares,"  "relocate,"  "retail  activity"
      and  "hotel services" shall have the meanings ascribed by section 22-621
      of the code, provided that whenever the term "taxable year"  appears  in

      "tax year" is defined in subdivision twelve of section  11-701  of  this
      chapter  except  when  the  taxable year referred to is the taxable year
      immediately  preceding  the  taxable  year  during  which  such   tenant
      relocates.
        (ii)  For  purposes  of this subdivision, the term "eligible business"
      shall have the meaning ascribed by section 22-621 of the code,  provided
    
      that  such  term  shall  in addition include any person subject to a tax
      imposed under subchapter four of chapter  six  of  this  title  and  any
      person  who  is  an  insurance  corporation  as  defined  in section one
      thousand  five  hundred  of  the tax law, which: (A) has been conducting
      substantial business  operations  at  one  or  more  business  locations
      outside  the  eligible  area  for  the  twenty-four  consecutive  months
      immediately preceding  the  taxable  year  during  which  such  eligible
      business  relocates;  and  (B)  on or after May twenty-seventh, nineteen
      hundred eighty-seven relocates all or part of such business  operations;
      and  (C)  on  or after May twenty-seventh, nineteen hundred eighty-seven
      first enters into a lease for the premises to which it  relocates  or  a
      parcel on which will be constructed such premises.
        (3)  The  reduction  allowed  by this subdivision may be claimed on an
      estimated basis on the returns filed for the tax periods ending  on  the

      extent, permitted by regulations  promulgated  by  the  commissioner  of
      finance.
        (4)  No tenant shall be authorized to receive a reduction in base rent
      subject to tax under the  provisions  of  this  subdivision,  until  the
      premises  with  respect to which it is claiming a reduction in base rent
      meet the requirements in the definition of eligible premises  and  until
      it  has  obtained  a  certification  of eligibility from the mayor or an
      agency designated by the mayor, and an  annual  certification  from  the
      mayor  or an agency designated by the mayor as to the number of eligible
      aggregate employment shares maintained by such tenant which may  qualify
      for  obtaining  a  base  rent  reduction  for the tenant's tax year. Any
      written documentation submitted to the mayor or such agency or  agencies
      in  order  to  obtain  any  such certification shall be deemed a written
      instrument for purposes of section 175.00 of the penal law.  Application
      fees  for  such  certifications shall be determined by the mayor or such
      agency or agencies. No certification of eligibility shall be  issued  to
      an   eligible   business  on  or  after  July  first,  nineteen  hundred
      ninety-nine unless  such  business  meets  the  requirements  of  either
      subparagraph (a) or (b) below:

      for improvements;
        (3) prior to such date such business submits a preliminary application
      for  a  certification  of  eligibility  to  such mayor or such agency or
      agencies with respect  to  a  proposed  relocation  to  such  particular
      premises; and
        (4) such business relocates to such particular premises not later than
      thirty-six  months  or, in a case in which the expenditures made for the
      improvements specified in clause two of this subparagraph are in  excess
      of  fifty  million  dollars  within  seventy-two months from the date of
      submission of such preliminary application; or
        (b) (1) not later than June thirtieth, two thousand two, such business
      has purchased, leased or entered into a contract to  purchase  or  lease
      particular  premises wholly contained in a building in which at least an
      aggregate of forty per centum  or  two  hundred  thousand  square  feet,
      whichever is less, of the nonresidential floor area of such building has
      been  purchased or leased by a business or businesses which meet or will
      meet the requirements of subparagraph (a) of this paragraph with respect
    
      to such floor area and which are or will become certified as eligible to
      receive a credit under section 22-622 of this code with respect to  such

        (3) not later than June thirtieth, two  thousand  two,  such  business
      relocates to such particular premises.
        Any  tenant subject to a tax imposed under chapter five, or subchapter
      two or three of chapter six, of this title obtaining a certification  of
      eligibility  pursuant  to  subdivision (b) of section 22-622 of the code
      shall be deemed  to  have  obtained  the  certification  of  eligibility
      required by this paragraph.
        g.  Whenever  the  rent  paid  by a tenant for his or her occupancy of
      taxable premises is measured in whole or in part by the  gross  receipts
      from  the  tenant's  sales  within such place, the tenant's rent, to the
      extent paid on the basis of such gross receipts, shall be deemed not  to
      exceed fifteen percent of such gross receipts.

      which, a tenant is eligible for  the  credit  allowed  pursuant  to  the
      provisions  of section 11-704.3 of this chapter with respect to eligible
      taxable premises, the term "base rent" as used in such provisions  shall
      be  the  base  rent  as determined prior to the allowance of any special
      reduction allowed by this subdivision.
        (d) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary,  for  purposes  of  this
      subdivision,  expansion  premises  shall  be  treated  as  separate  and
      distinct from any other premises of the expansion  tenant  in  the  same
      eligible building.
        (3) The special reduction allowed by this subdivision shall be allowed
      commencing  on  the  rent commencement date; however, if the date of the
      certificate of abatement or certificate of eligibility is later than the
      rent commencement date, the tenant shall not,  in  the  first  instance,
      claim the special reduction on any return required to be filed for a tax
      period  ending  prior  to  the  date of such certificate of abatement or
      certificate of eligibility. If the date of such certificate of abatement
      or certificate of eligibility falls in a tax period  subsequent  to  the
      tax  period  in  which  the  rent commencement date falls, but both such
      dates fall within the same tax year, the special reduction that was  not
      claimed  in the first instance for any period preceding the date of such
      certificate  of  abatement  or  certificate  of  eligibility  shall   be
    
      reflected  in  the  final  return  for  the tax year. If the date of the
      certificate of abatement or certificate of eligibility falls in the  tax
      year  following  the tax year in which the rent commencement date falls,
      an  amended  final  return  shall  be filed for such earlier tax year in
      which shall be reflected any special reduction allowable  for  such  tax
      year;  in  addition,  the  final  return  for  such later tax year shall
      reflect any special reduction that was not claimed in the first instance
      for any period in such tax year preceding the date of the certificate of
      abatement or certificate of eligibility.
        (4)  (a)  With  respect   to   premises   located   in   an   eligible
      government-owned  building,  no special reduction shall be allowed under
      this subdivision unless:
        (i) the landlord enters into a lease for eligible premises with a  new
      tenant or a renewal tenant and:
        (A) the lease commencement date is within the eligibility period; and
        (B)  (I) if, by the sixtieth day following the rent commencement date,
      such new or renewal tenant employs  fifty  or  fewer  employees  in  the
      eligible  premises,  the  initial lease term is for a period of at least
      five years, provided, however, that with respect to a  lease  commencing
      on  or after July first, nineteen hundred ninety-six if, by the sixtieth

      and provided, further, that with respect to a  lease  commencing  on  or

      initial  lease term is for a period of at least three years, or (II) if,
      by the sixtieth day following the rent commencement date,  such  new  or
      renewal  tenant  employs  more  than  fifty  employees  in  the eligible
      premises, the initial lease term is for a period of at least ten  years,
      provided,  however,  that with respect to a lease commencing on or after
      July  first,  nineteen  hundred  ninety-six  if,  by  the  sixtieth  day
      following the rent commencement date, such new or renewal tenant employs
      more  than  one  hundred twenty-five employees in the eligible premises,
      the initial lease term is for a period of at least ten years; or
        (ii) the landlord enters into a lease with  an  expansion  tenant  for
      expansion premises and:
        (A) the lease commencement date is within the eligibility period;
        (B)  if  the  expansion  premises are located in the eligible building
      previously occupied by such expansion tenant, the  lease  term  for  the
      premises  in the eligible building previously occupied by such expansion
      tenant will expire no earlier than the expiration date  of  the  initial
      lease  term  for  the  expansion  premises,  provided  that  where  such
      expansion tenant occupies premises in the eligible building  under  more
      than  one  lease,  the  foregoing  provision  of this subclause shall be
      applied with reference to the lease  for  the  premises  containing  the
      largest  amount  of  square feet, provided, however, that this subclause
      shall not apply to a lease commencing on or after July  first,  nineteen
      hundred ninety-six; and
        (C)  (I) if, by the sixtieth day following the rent commencement date,
      such expansion tenant employs fifty or fewer employees in  the  eligible
      building  in which the expansion premises are located, the initial lease
      term for the expansion premises is for a period of at least five  years,
      provided,  however,  that with respect to a lease commencing on or after

      following  the rent commencement date, such expansion tenant employs one
      hundred twenty-five or fewer employees in the  expansion  premises,  the
    
      initial  lease  term  for  the  expansion premises is for a period of at
      least five years, and provided, further, that with respect  to  a  lease
      commencing on or after April first, nineteen hundred ninety-seven if, by
      the  sixtieth  day  following the rent commencement date, such expansion
      tenant employs  one  hundred  twenty-five  or  fewer  employees  in  the
      expansion premises, the initial lease term for the expansion premises is
      for  a  period  of at least three years, or (II) if, by the sixtieth day
      following the rent commencement date, such expansion tenant employs more
      than fifty employees in such eligible building, the initial  lease  term
      for  the  expansion  premises  is  for  a  period of at least ten years,
      provided, however, that with respect to a lease commencing on  or  after

      initial  lease  term  for  the  expansion premises is for a period of at
      least ten years.
        (b) Notwithstanding anything in this subdivision to the contrary, with
      respect to premises located in an eligible government-owned building, no
      certificate of eligibility shall be  issued  and  no  special  reduction
      shall be allowed under this subdivision if:
        (i)  the  tenant  has  relocated to such premises from any area in the
      borough of Manhattan north of the center line of 96th street or from any
      portion of the boroughs  of  the  Bronx,  Brooklyn,  Queens,  or  Staten
      Island; or
        (ii)  the  lease  for  such  premises provides that during the initial
      lease term required under subparagraph (a) of this paragraph either  the
      landlord  or the tenant may terminate such lease prior to the expiration
      of such required initial  lease  term,  provided  that  such  lease  may
      provide  that either the landlord or the tenant may terminate such lease
      if (A) the other party is in default of any of such party's  obligations
      under  the  lease, (B) the eligible premises are damaged or destroyed by
      fire or other casualty, (C) the eligible premises are rendered  unusable
      for  any  reason not attributable to any act or failure to act of either

        (c)  For  purposes  of  this paragraph, the expiration date of a lease
      shall be determined by the expiration date  set  forth  in  such  lease,
      without  giving  effect  to  any rights of the landlord or the tenant to
      terminate such lease prior to the expiration date set forth therein.
        (5)  (a)  (i)  With  respect  to  premises  located  in  an   eligible
      government-owned   building,   an   application  for  a  certificate  of
      eligibility entitling a tenant to claim the special reduction allowed by
      this subdivision shall be filed by such tenant with  the  department  of
      finance  on  or  after  the  date  on  which  the lease for the eligible
      premises is executed by the landlord and tenant but  in  no  event  more
      than   one   hundred  eighty  days  following  the  later  of  the  rent
      commencement date or the date that chapter four of the laws of  nineteen
      hundred ninety-five became a law, and no such certificate of eligibility
      shall be issued unless such application is filed within such time.
        (ii)  Notwithstanding  clause  (i)  of this subparagraph and any other
      provision of law to the contrary, with respect to a lease commencing  on
      or  after July first, nineteen hundred ninety-six in premises located in
      an eligible government-owned building, an application for a  certificate
      of eligibility entitling a tenant to claim the special reduction allowed

      hundred  ninety-seven  that added this clause became a law, whichever is
      later, and no such certificate of eligibility  shall  be  issued  unless
      such application is filed within such time.
        (b) In addition to any other information required by the department of
      finance, such application for a certificate of eligibility shall include
      (i)  an  abstract  of the lease for the eligible taxable premises, which
      shall include the lease commencement date, the  rent  commencement  date
      and the expiration date of such lease, (ii) a statement as to the number
      of  persons employed by the tenant in the eligible taxable premises and,
      where applicable, in the eligible building containing such premises,  by
      the sixtieth day following the rent commencement date, (iii) a statement
      as to the location of all office or retail space in the city occupied by
      the  tenant prior to the execution of the lease for the eligible taxable

      such  office  or  retail  space  located  in  the  abatement  zone. Such
      application shall also state that the tenant agrees to comply  with  and
      be  subject  to  such  rules  as  may be issued from time to time by the
      department of finance.
        (c) The department of finance shall issue a certificate of eligibility
      upon determining that an application filed pursuant  to  this  paragraph
      meets the requirements set forth in this subdivision, provided, however,
      that  no such certificate of eligibility shall be issued if any payments
      in lieu of taxes, water or sewer charges or other lienable  charges  are
      due and owing with respect to such eligible government-owned building at
      the  time  such  application is pending, unless such payments in lieu of
      taxes or charges are at such time  being  paid  in  timely  installments
      pursuant  to a written agreement with the department of finance or other
      appropriate agency.
        (d) The burden of proof shall be on the tenant to show  by  clear  and
      convincing  evidence that the requirements for granting a certificate of
      eligibility have been satisfied. The department of  finance  shall  have
      the authority to require that statements in connection with applications
      pursuant to this paragraph be made under oath.
        (e)  The  department of finance may provide by rule for the payment by
      tenants of premises in eligible government-owned buildings of reasonable
      administrative  charges  or  fees  necessary  to  defray   expenses   in
      connection  with the determination of initial and continuing eligibility
      for the special reduction allowed by this subdivision.
        (6) (a) If an eligible tenant (i) sublets any portion of the  eligible
      taxable premises to any other person, or (ii) otherwise ceases to occupy
      or  use  any  portion of the premises as eligible taxable premises, such
      tenant shall, immediately upon the occurrence of any such  event,  cease
      to  be  eligible  for  the special reduction allowed by this subdivision
      with respect to the portion of the premises which  is  sublet  or  which
      ceases  to  be  occupied  or  used  by  such  tenant as eligible taxable
      premises, and for any period following the occurrence of any such event,
      the special reduction otherwise allowed by  this  subdivision  shall  be
      reduced  by  an  amount  determined  by  multiplying  the amount of such
      special reduction by the percentage of the premises which is  sublet  or
      which  has  ceased  to be occupied or used as eligible taxable premises.
      Such tenant shall give written notice of  the  occurrence  of  any  such
      event  to  the  department of finance within thirty days thereof. If the
      tenant fails to give such notice, an assessment of  any  additional  tax
      that  may become due as a result of the occurrence of any such event may
      be made at any time, notwithstanding anything in section 11-717 of  this
      chapter to the contrary.
    
        (b) Notwithstanding anything in this chapter to the contrary, a tenant
      claiming  the special reduction allowed by this subdivision shall file a
      return for each tax period with respect to which such special  reduction
      is  claimed.  Each  such  return  shall  contain  a certification by the
      tenant,  in such form as the department of finance may prescribe, to the
      effect that such tenant meets all the requirements of this  subdivision,
      and  no  special  reduction  shall  be  allowed  if such return does not
      contain such certification by such tenant.
        (c) If any  special  reduction  allowed  under  this  subdivision  was
      obtained  by  a  tenant as a result of having made a false or misleading
      statement as to a material fact or having omitted to state any  material
      fact  necessary in order to make such statement not false or misleading,
      no such special reduction shall be allowed and any additional  tax  that
      becomes  due  as  a  result  of such disallowance may be assessed at any
      time, notwithstanding anything in section 11-717 of this chapter to  the
      contrary.  In  addition,  the department of finance may declare any such
      tenant to be ineligible  to  claim  any  special  reduction  under  this
      subdivision  in  the  future  with  respect  to  the  same  or any other
      premises.
        7.  A  determination  by  the  department  of  finance   pursuant   to
      subdivision  six  of  section  four  hundred  ninety-nine-f  of the real
      property tax law to deny, terminate or revoke any abatement applied  for
      or  granted  pursuant to title four of article four of the real property
      tax law based on the relationship between the landlord  and  the  tenant
      shall  not  be  dispositive  of  whether  such  tenant is eligible for a
      special reduction under this subdivision. The department of finance  may
      determine  that  such  tenant  is eligible for a special reduction under
      this subdivision and may issue a  certificate  of  eligibility  to  such
      tenant  in  accordance with the procedures and pursuant to the standards
      applicable  to  a  tenant   of   premises   located   in   an   eligible
      government-owned building, provided, however, that any application filed
      pursuant  to  paragraph  five  of  this  subdivision  by  a tenant whose
      application for a certificate of abatement pursuant  to  title  four  of
      article  four  of the real property tax law was denied by the department
      of  finance  pursuant  to  subdivision  six  of  section  four   hundred
      ninety-nine-f  of  the  real  property tax law based on the relationship
      between the landlord and the tenant, or by a  tenant  whose  application
      for a certificate of abatement pursuant to title four of article four of
      the  real property tax law was granted by the department of finance, but
      whose abatement was terminated or revoked by the department  of  finance
      pursuant to subdivision six of section four hundred ninety-nine-f of the
      real property tax law based on the relationship between the landlord and
      the  tenant,  may  be  deemed  by the department of finance to have been
      filed on the date the application for such certificate of abatement  was
      filed.  This paragraph shall only apply to leases commencing on or after
      April first, nineteen hundred ninety-seven.

                                           rent for such period:
      At least:                But not over:

      nine-tenths percent of base rent by a fraction the numerator of which is
      three  hundred  thousand  dollars  minus the amount of base rent and the
      denominator of which is fifty thousand dollars.  If  the  tenant's  base
      rent  is over three hundred thousand dollars, no credit shall be allowed
      under this paragraph. For purposes of this paragraph, 'base rent'  shall
      be  calculated  without  regard to any reduction in base rent allowed by

      one  year,  such  base  rent  shall,  for  purposes  of this section, be
      determined as if it had been on an equivalent basis for the entire year.
      The credits allowed under this section shall be deducted  prior  to  the
    
      deduction  of  any  credit  allowable  under  section  11-704.1  of this
      chapter.
        (2)  For  purposes  of  paragraphs four and five of subdivision (a) of
      this section, base rent  for  the  period  specified  in  each  of  such
      paragraphs  shall  be  separately  annualized  as  if  it had been on an
      equivalent basis for an entire year, irrespective  of  the  actual  base
      rent for the tax year including the period specified in such paragraph.

        ยง  11-705 Returns.   a. Every tenant subject to tax under this chapter
      shall file with the commissioner of finance a return with respect to the
      taxes payable for the three month periods ending on  the  last  days  of
      August,  November  and  February  of  each  year and a final return with
      respect to the taxes payable for the tax year ending on the last day  of
      May  of  each year.  Such returns shall be filed within twenty days from
      the expiration of the period covered thereby. A  tenant  who  is  exempt
      from  the  tax  by  reason  of paragraph two of subdivision b of section
      11-704 of this chapter shall nevertheless be required to  file  a  final
      return, provided, however, that for tax years beginning on or after June
      first,  nineteen  hundred  ninety-five  and  ending  on  or  before  May
      thirty-first, nineteen hundred ninety-seven, no such final return  shall
      be  required from such exempt tenant with respect to taxable premises if
      (1) the tenant's rent for such premises, determined  without  regard  to
      any  deduction  from  or  reduction in rent or base rent allowed by this
      chapter, does not exceed fifteen thousand dollars for the tax  year  and
      (2)  in the case of a tenant who has more than one taxable premises, the
      aggregate rents for all such premises, determined without regard to  any
      deduction  from  or  reduction  in  rent  or  base  rent allowed by this
      chapter, do not exceed fifteen thousand dollars for the  tax  year.  For
      tax  years  beginning  on  June first, nineteen hundred ninety-seven and
      ending on or before May thirty-first, two thousand one,  no  such  final
      return  shall  be  required  from such exempt tenant with respect to any
      taxable premises if (1) the tenant's rent for such premises,  determined
      without  regard  to any deduction from or reduction in rent or base rent
      allowed by this chapter, does not exceed seventy-five  thousand  dollars
      for  the  tax  year  and (2) the amount of rent received or due from any
      subtenant of such exempt tenant with respect to such premises  does  not
      exceed  seventy-five  thousand  dollars  for the tax year. For tax years
      beginning on or after June first, two thousand one, no such final return
      shall be required from such exempt tenant with respect  to  any  taxable
      premises  if (1) the tenant's rent for such premises, determined without
      regard to any deduction from or reduction in rent or base  rent  allowed
      by  this  chapter,  does not exceed two hundred thousand dollars for the
      tax year and (2) the amount of rent received or due from  any  subtenant
      of  such exempt tenant with respect to such premises does not exceed two
      hundred thousand dollars for the tax year. Notwithstanding  anything  in
      this  subdivision to the contrary, for tax periods beginning on or after
      September first,  nineteen  hundred  ninety-five,  no  return  shall  be
      required  pursuant  to  this  subdivision  with  respect  to any taxable
      premises located in that part of the city specified in paragraph one  of
      subdivision  h  of  section  11-704 of this chapter, and no such taxable
      premises shall be taken into account for purposes of clause two  of  the
      preceding  sentence.  The  commissioner of finance may permit or require
      returns (including final returns) to be made for other periods and  upon
      such  dates  as  the  commissioner may specify and if he or she deems it
      necessary, in order to insure the payment of the  tax  imposed  by  this
      chapter,  the  commissioner  may  require  such  returns  to be made for
      shorter periods than those prescribed by  the  foregoing  provisions  of
      this section, and upon such dates as he or she may specify.
        b. The commissioner of finance may by regulation require the filing of
      information  returns  and  supplemental information returns by landlords
      and by tenants of taxable premises, whether or not they are required  to
      pay the tax imposed by this chapter, upon such dates or at such times as
      the  commissioner  may  specify  if  he  or she deems the filing of such
      information returns necessary for proper administration of this chapter.
        c. The form of returns and information returns shall be prescribed  by
      the  commissioner  of  finance and shall contain such information as the
    
      commissioner may deem necessary for the proper  administration  of  this
      chapter.  The  commissioner  of  finance  may require amended returns or
      amended information returns to be filed within twenty days after  notice
      and to contain the information specified in the notice.
        d.  If  a return or information return is not filed, or if a return of
      any kind when filed is  incorrect  or  insufficient  on  its  face,  the
      commissioner  of  finance  shall take the necessary steps to enforce the
      filing of such a return or of a corrected return.

      due and payable on or before the twentieth day  of  the  calendar  month
      following  the  end  of  each  tax  period  and  shall  be  paid  to the
      commissioner of finance, as follows: The tax to be  paid  at  such  time
      shall  be based on the base rent for such tax period and the rate of tax
      shall be the one which would be applicable if the  base  rent  for  such
      period  were  the  same  for each tax period during the tax year, except
      that the payment required to be made together with the final  return  or
      at the time that the final return should be filed shall be the amount by
      which  the  actual  tax  for the tax year exceeds the amounts previously
      paid for the tax year.
        b. Where the final return shows that the amount of tax  paid  for  the
      tax  year  exceeds  the  actual  tax  for such year, the commissioner of
      finance shall make the  appropriate  refund  as  promptly  as  possible,
      provided,  however, that where the commissioner of finance has reason to
      believe that the  final  return  is  inaccurate,  the  commissioner  may
      withhold the refund in whole or in part. The making of a refund pursuant
      to  this  subdivision shall not prevent the commissioner of finance from
      making a determination that additional tax is due or from  pursuing  any
      other  method  to  recover the full amount of the actual tax due for the
      tax year.
        c. Where a tenant ceases to do business the tax, as  measured  by  the
      tenant's  base  rent  for  the  prior part of the tax year, shall be due
      immediately, and the tenant shall file a final return, but,  should  the
      tenant  continue  to pay rent for the taxable premises, the tenant shall
      file the normally required returns and a final return for the tax  year,
      provided,  however,  that  any  such  tax  payment  shall  be applied in
      reduction of the tax payments required to be made with such  returns  or
      with the final return for such tax year.

      that  they be kept for a longer time, shall be preserved for a period of
      three years except that leases or agreements  which  fix  the  rents  or

      commissioner of finance shall determine the amount of tax due from  such
      information as may be obtainable and, if necessary, may estimate the tax
      on  the basis of external indices. Notice of such determination shall be
      given  to  the  person  liable  for  the  payment  of  the   tax.   Such
      determination  shall  finally  and  irrevocably  fix  the tax unless the
      person against whom it is assessed, within ninety days after the  giving
      of  notice  of such determination or, if the commissioner of finance has
      established a conciliation procedure pursuant to section 11-124  of  the
      code  and  the  taxpayer  has  requested  a  conciliation  conference in
      accordance  therewith,  within  ninety  days  from  the  mailing  of   a

      proceeding  under  article  seventy-eight  of the civil practice law and
      rules if application therefor is made to the supreme court by the person
      against whom the tax was assessed within four months after the giving of

      practice law and rules shall not be instituted by a taxpayer unless: (a)
      the amount of any tax sought to be reviewed, with interest and penalties
      thereon, if any,  shall  be  first  deposited  and  there  is  filed  an

      authorized  to  transact  business  in  this  state  and approved by the
      superintendent  of  insurance  of  this  state  as   to   solvency   and

      interest  and  penalties  stated  in  such  decision  plus the costs and
      charges  which  may  accrue  against  it  in  the  prosecution  of   the
      proceeding,  in  which  event  the taxpayer shall not be required to pay

      collected or paid, if written application to the commissioner of finance
      for such refund shall be made within eighteen months from the date fixed
      by this chapter for filing the return on which such payment was based or

      notice  thereof  to the taxpayer in writing. The commissioner of finance
      may, in lieu of any refund required to be made, allow credit therefor on

      months after the giving of notice of such decision, and provided, in the
      case  of an application by a taxpayer, that a final determination of tax
      due was not previously made. Such a proceeding shall not  be  instituted
      by  a  taxpayer  unless  an  undertaking  shall  first be filed with the
      commissioner of finance, in such amount and  with  such  sureties  as  a
      justice  of  the supreme court shall approve, to the effect that if such
      proceeding be dismissed or the tax confirmed, the taxpayer will pay  all
      costs and charges which may accrue in the prosecution of the proceeding.
        c.  A  person  shall  not  be entitled to a revision, refund or credit

      herself  of  the remedies therein provided. No refund or credit shall be
      made of a tax, interest or penalty paid after  a  determination  by  the
      commissioner  of finance made pursuant to section 11-708 of this chapter
      unless it be found that such determination  was  erroneous,  illegal  or
      unconstitutional,  or  otherwise  improper,  by the tax appeals tribunal
      after a hearing, or, if such tax appeals tribunal affirms in whole or in
      part the determination of the commissioner of finance, in  a  proceeding
      under  article  seventy-eight  of  the  civil  practice  law  and rules,
      pursuant to the provisions of said section, in  which  event  refund  or

      for money had and received or by any action or proceeding other than, in
      the case of a decision by the tax appeals tribunal sitting  en  banc,  a
      proceeding  under  article  seventy-eight  of the civil practice law and
      rules; provided, however, that a taxpayer  may  proceed  by  declaratory
      judgment  if  he  or  she  institutes  suit  within  thirty days after a
      deficiency assessment is made and pays  the  amount  of  the  deficiency
      assessment  to  the  commissioner of finance prior to the institution of
      such suit and posts a bond for costs as provided in  section  11-708  of

Section 11-712 ::    
        
     
        ยง 11-712 Proceedings to recover tax. a. Whenever any person shall fail
      to  pay any tax or penalty or interest imposed by this chapter as herein
      provided, the  corporation  counsel  shall,  upon  the  request  of  the
      commissioner  of  finance,  bring  or  cause  to be brought an action to
      enforce payment of the same against the person liable for  the  same  on
      behalf  of the city of New York in any court of the state of New York or
      of  any  other  state  or  of  the  United  States.  If,  however,   the
      commissioner  of  finance  in  his  or  her  discretion  believes that a
      taxpayer subject to the provisions of this chapter  is  about  to  cease
      business, leave the state or remove or dissipate the assets out of which
      tax  or  penalties  might  be satisfied and that any such tax or penalty
      will not be paid when due, he or she may declare such tax or penalty  to
      be immediately due and payable and may issue a warrant immediately.
        b.  As  an additional or alternate remedy, the commissioner of finance
      may issue a warrant, directed to the city sheriff commanding the sheriff
      to levy upon and sell the real and  personal  property  of  such  person
      which  may  be  found  within  the  city,  for the payment of the amount
      thereof, with any penalties and interest, and the cost of executing  the
      warrant,  and  to return such warrant to the commissioner of finance and
      to pay to the commissioner the money collected by virtue thereof  within
      sixty  days  after  the receipt of such warrant. The city sheriff shall,
      within five days after the receipt of the warrant, file with the  county
      clerk  a  copy  thereof,  and  thereupon  such  clerk shall enter in the
      judgment docket the name of the person mentioned in the warrant and  the
      amount  of  the  tax,  penalties  and  interest for which the warrant is
      issued and the date when such copy is filed.  Thereupon  the  amount  of
      such  warrant  so  docketed  shall  become  a lien upon the title to and
      interest in real and personal property of the person  against  whom  the
      warrant  is issued. The city sheriff shall then proceed upon the warrant
      in the same manner and with like effect  as  that  provided  by  law  in
      respect  to executions issued against property upon judgments of a court
      of record, and for services in executing the warrant the  sheriff  shall
      be  entitled  to the same fees which the sheriff may collect in the same
      manner. In the discretion of the commissioner of finance  a  warrant  of
      like  terms,  force and effect may be issued and directed to any officer
      or employee of the department of finance, and in the  execution  thereof
      such officer or employee shall have all the powers conferred by law upon
      sheriffs,  but  he or she shall be entitled to no fee or compensation in
      excess of the actual expenses paid in the performance of such duty. If a
      warrant is returned not satisfied in full, the commissioner  of  finance
      may  from  time  to time issue new warrants and shall also have the same
      remedies to enforce the  amount  due  thereunder  as  if  the  city  had
      recovered  judgment  therefor  and  execution  thereon had been returned
      unsatisfied.
        c. Whenever there is made a sale, transfer or assignment  in  bulk  of
      any  part  or  the  whole  of  a stock of merchandise or of fixtures, or
      merchandise and of fixtures pertaining to the conducting of the business
      of the seller, transferor or assignor, otherwise than  in  the  ordinary
      course  of  trade  and  in the regular prosecution of said business, the
      purchaser, transferee or assignee shall at least ten days before  taking
      possession  of  such merchandise, fixtures, or merchandise and fixtures,
      or paying therefor, notify the commissioner  of  finance  by  registered
      mail of the proposed sale and of the price, terms and conditions thereof
      whether  or  not the seller, transferor or assignor, has represented to,
      or informed the purchaser, transferee or assignee that it owes  any  tax
      pursuant to this chapter and whether or not the purchaser, transferee or
      assignee  has  knowledge that such taxes are owing, and whether any such
      taxes are in fact owing.
    
        Whenever the purchaser, transferee or  assignee  shall  fail  to  give
      notice  to  the  commissioner  of  finance  as required by the preceding
      paragraph, or whenever the commissioner  of  finance  shall  inform  the
      purchaser,  transferee or assignee that a possible claim for such tax or
      taxes  exists, any sums of money, property or choses in action, or other
      consideration, which the purchaser, transferee or assignee  is  required
      to  transfer over to the seller, transferor or assignor shall be subject
      to a first priority right and lien for any  such  taxes  theretofore  or
      thereafter  determined to be due from the seller, transferor or assignor
      to the city, and the purchaser, transferee or assignee is  forbidden  to
      transfer  to  the seller, transferor or assignor any such sums of money,
      property or choses in action to the extent of the amount of  the  city's
      claim.  For  failure  to comply with the provisions of this subdivision,
      the purchaser, transferee or assignee, in addition to being  subject  to
      the  liabilities  and  remedies  imposed under the provisions of section
      forty-four of the personal property law, shall be personally liable  for
      the  payment  to  the  city  of any such taxes theretofore or thereafter
      determined to be  due  to  the  city  from  the  seller,  transferor  or
      assignor,  and  such  liability may be assessed and enforced in the same
      manner as the liability for tax under this chapter.
        d. The commissioner of finance, if he or she finds that the  interests
      of the city will not thereby be jeopardized, and upon such conditions as
      the  commissioner  of finance may require, may release any property from
      the lien of any  warrant  or  vacate  such  warrant  for  unpaid  taxes,
      additions to tax, penalties and interest filed pursuant to subdivision b
      of  this  section,  and  such  release or vacating of the warrant may be
      recorded in the office of any recording officer in  which  such  warrant
      has been filed. The clerk shall thereupon cancel and discharge as of the
      original date of docketing the vacated warrant.

      quarterly return. If any amount of tax required to be paid together with
      a return, other than the final return for a tax year, is not paid on  or
      before  the  last  date  prescribed  for  payment (without regard to any
      extension of time granted for payment), interest on such amount  at  the
      rate  set  by the commissioner of finance pursuant to subdivision (h) of
      this section, or, if no rate is set, at the rate of seven  and  one-half
      percent  per  annum,  shall  be  paid for the period from such last date
      until twenty days after the end  of  the  tax  year  during  which  such
      payments  were  due or until such prior time as the tax paid for the tax
      year equals seventy-five percent of the full tax required to be paid for
      the tax year. Such interest shall be paid with the final return for  the
      tax  year to which it relates. In computing the amount of interest to be
      paid, such interest shall  be  compounded  daily.  Interest  under  this
      subdivision  shall  not  be  paid if the amount thereof is less than one
      dollar.
        (b) Interest on underpayment; final  return.  If  any  amount  of  tax
      required to be paid together with the final return for a tax year is not
      paid  on  or before the last date prescribed for payment (without regard
      to any extension of time granted for payment), interest on  such  amount
      at  the  rate set by the commissioner of finance pursuant to subdivision
      (h) of this section, or, if no rate is set, at the  rate  of  seven  and
      one-half  percent per annum, shall be paid for the period from such last
      date to the date of payment. In computing the amount of interest  to  be
      paid,  such  interest  shall  be  compounded  daily. Interest under this
      subdivision shall not be paid if the amount thereof  is  less  than  one
      dollar.

      a  final  return  under  this  chapter  on or before the prescribed date
      (determined with regard to any extension of time for filing), unless  it
      is  shown  that  such  failure is due to reasonable cause and not due to
      willful neglect, there shall be added to the amount required to be shown
      as tax on such return five percent of the amount  of  such  tax  if  the
      failure  is for not more than one month, with an additional five percent
      for each additional month or fraction thereof during which such  failure
      continues,  not  exceeding twenty-five percent in the aggregate, and, in
      addition thereto, where a tenant, with respect to any taxable  premises,
      is  exempt  from  tax  by  reason  of  paragraph two of subdivision b of
      section 11-704 of this chapter, there shall be imposed a penalty of  one
      hundred dollars.

      of the date prescribed for filing of such return (determined with regard
      to  any  extension  of  time  for  filing), unless it is shown that such
      failure is due to reasonable cause and not due to willful  neglect,  the
      addition  to  tax  under subparagraph (A) of this paragraph shall not be
      less than the lesser of one hundred dollars or one  hundred  percent  of
      the amount required to be shown as tax on such return.
        (C)  For  purposes of this paragraph, the amount of tax required to be
      shown on the return shall be reduced by the amount of any  part  of  the
      tax  which  is  paid on or before the date prescribed for payment of the
      tax and by the amount of any credit against the tax which may be claimed
      upon the return.

      is  due  to reasonable cause and not due to willful neglect, there shall
    
      be added to the amount shown as tax  on  such  return  one-half  of  one
      percent  of  the  amount of such tax if the failure is not for more than
      one  month,  with  an  additional  one-half  of  one  percent  for  each
      additional   month   or  fraction  thereof  during  which  such  failure
      continues, not exceeding twenty-five percent in the aggregate.  For  the
      purpose  of computing the addition for any month the amount of tax shown
      on the return shall be reduced by the amount of  any  part  of  the  tax
      which is paid on or before the beginning of such month and by the amount
      of  any  credit against the tax which may be claimed upon the return. If
      the amount of tax required to be shown on a  return  is  less  than  the
      amount  shown  as tax on such return, this paragraph shall be applied by
      substituting such lower amount.
        (3) Failure to pay tax required to be shown on final return.  In  case
      of  failure to pay any amount in respect of any tax required to be shown
      on a final return required to be filed under this chapter which  is  not
      so  shown  (including a determination made pursuant to section 11-708 of
      this chapter) within ten days  of  the  date  of  a  notice  and  demand
      therefor,  unless  it  is  shown  that such failure is due to reasonable
      cause and not due to willful neglect, there shall be added to the amount
      of tax stated in such notice and demand one-half of one percent of  such
      tax  if  the  failure is not for more than one month, with an additional
      one-half of one percent for each additional month  or  fraction  thereof
      during  which  such failure continues, not exceeding twenty-five percent
      in the aggregate. For the purpose of  computing  the  addition  for  any
      month,  the  amount  of  tax  stated  in  the notice and demand shall be
      reduced by the amount of any part of the tax which is  paid  before  the
      beginning of such month.
        * (4) Limitations on additions.
        (A) With respect to any final return, the amount of the addition under
      paragraph  one of this subdivision shall be reduced by the amount of the
      addition under paragraph two of this subdivision for any month to  which
      an  addition  applies  under  both  paragraphs  one and two. In any case
      described in subparagraph (B) of paragraph one of this subdivision,  the
      amount  of  the  addition  under such paragraph one shall not be reduced
      below the amount provided in such subparagraph.
        (B) With respect to any  final  return,  the  maximum  amount  of  the
      addition  permitted  under  paragraph three of this subdivision shall be
      reduced by the amount of  the  addition  under  paragraph  one  of  this
      subdivision  (determined  without  regard  to  subparagraph  (B) of such
      paragraph one) which is attributable to the tax for which the notice and
      demand is made and which is not paid within ten days of such notice  and

      underpayment (determined without regard to any extension) and ending  on
      the  date  of the assessment of the tax (or, if earlier, the date of the

      certify any return,  or  to  supply  any  information  within  the  time
      required  by or under this chapter, shall be liable for a penalty of not
      more than one  thousand  dollars,  in  addition  to  any  other  amounts
      required under this chapter to be imposed, assessed and collected by the
      commissioner  of  finance.  The  commissioner  of finance shall have the
      power, in his or her discretion, to  waive,  reduce  or  compromise  any
      penalty under this subdivision.
        (g)  The  interest and penalties imposed by this section shall be paid
      and disposed of in the same manner as other revenues from this  chapter.
      Unpaid  interest and penalties may be enforced in the same manner as the
      tax imposed by this chapter.
        (h) (1) Authority to set interest rates. The commissioner  of  finance
      shall  set  the rate of interest to be paid pursuant to subdivisions (a)
      and (b) of this section, but if no such rate of interest  is  set,  such
      rate  shall be deemed to be set at seven and one-half percent per annum.
      Such rate shall be the same for each subdivision and shall be  the  rate
      prescribed  in  paragraph  two of this subdivision but shall not be less
      than seven and one-half percent per annum. Any  such  rate  set  by  the
      commissioner  of  finance  shall apply to taxes, or any portion thereof,
      which remain or become due on or after  the  date  on  which  such  rate
      becomes effective and shall apply only with respect to interest computed
      or computable for periods or portions of periods occurring in the period
      in which such rate is in effect.
        (2)  General  rule.  The  rate  of interest set under this subdivision
      shall be the sum of (i) the federal short-term rate  as  provided  under
      paragraph three of this subdivision, plus (ii) seven percentage points.
        (3) Federal short-term rate. For purposes of this subdivision:
        (A)  The  federal  short-term  rate for any month shall be the federal
      short-term rate  determined  by  the  United  States  secretary  of  the
      treasury  during such month in accordance with subsection (d) of section
      twelve hundred seventy-four of the internal  revenue  code  for  use  in
      connection  with  section  six  thousand  six  hundred twenty-one of the
      internal revenue code. Any such rate shall be  rounded  to  the  nearest
      full  percent  (or,  if a multiple of one-half of one percent, such rate
      shall be increased to the next highest full percent).
        (B) Period during which rate applies.
        (i)  In  general.  Except  as  provided  in  clause   (ii)   of   this
      subparagraph,  the  federal  short-term rate for the first month in each
      calendar quarter shall apply during the first calendar quarter beginning
      after such month. (ii) Special rule for the month of September, nineteen
    
      hundred eighty-nine. The federal short-term rate for the month of April,
      nineteen hundred eighty-nine shall apply with  respect  to  setting  the
      rate   of   interest  for  the  month  of  September,  nineteen  hundred
      eighty-nine.
        (4)  Publication  of  interest rate. The commissioner of finance shall
      cause to be published in the city record,  and  give  other  appropriate
      general notice of, the interest rate to be set under this subdivision no
      later  than  twenty days preceding the first day of the calendar quarter
      during which such interest rate applies. The setting and publication  of
      such  interest  rate  shall  not  be  included  within  paragraph (a) of
      subdivision five of section one thousand forty-one of the  city  charter
      relating to the definition of a rule.
        * (i)  Miscellaneous.  (1)  The  certificate  of  the  commissioner of
      finance to the effect that a tax has not been paid, that  a  return  has
      not  been  filed,  or that information has not been supplied pursuant to
      the provisions of this chapter shall be prima facie evidence thereof.
        (2) Cross-reference: For criminal penalties, see chapter forty of this
      title.

        * (j)  Substantial  understatement  of  liability.  If  there   is   a
      substantial understatement of tax for any tax year, there shall be added
      to  the  tax  an  amount  equal  to  ten  percent  of  the amount of any
      underpayment attributable to such understatement. For purposes  of  this
      subdivision,  there  is  a substantial understatement of tax for any tax
      year if the amount of the understatement for the tax  year  exceeds  the
      greater  of  ten  percent  of  the tax required to be shown on the final
      return for the tax year or five thousand dollars. For  purposes  of  the
      preceding  sentence,  the  term "understatement" means the excess of the
      amount of the tax required to be shown on the final return for  the  tax
      year,  over  the amount of the tax imposed which is shown on the return,
      reduced by any rebate.  The  amount  of  such  understatement  shall  be
      reduced  by  that portion of the understatement which is attributable to
      the tax treatment of any item  by  the  taxpayer  if  there  is  or  was
      substantial  authority  for  such treatment, or any item with respect to
      which  the  relevant  facts  affecting  the  item's  tax  treatment  are
      adequately  disclosed  in  the  return or in a statement attached to the
      return. The commissioner of finance may waive all or  any  part  of  the
      addition  to  tax  provided  by  this  subdivision  on  a showing by the
      taxpayer that there was reasonable cause for the understatement (or part
      thereof) and that the taxpayer acted in good faith.
        * NB Added Ch. 765/85 ยง 54, language juxtaposed per Ch. 907/85 ยง 14
        * (k) Aiding  or  assisting  in  the  giving  of  fraudulent  returns,
      reports,  statements  or  other  documents. (1) Any person who, with the
      intent that tax be evaded, shall, for a fee or other compensation or  as
      an  incident  to the performance of other services for which such person
      receives compensation, aid or assist in, or procure, counsel, or  advise
      the  preparation or presentation under, or in connection with any matter
      arising under this chapter of any return,  report,  statement  or  other
      document  which  is  fraudulent  or  false as to any material matter, or
      supply any false or fraudulent information, whether or not such  falsity
      or  fraud  is  with the knowledge or consent of the person authorized or
      required to present such return, report,  statement  or  other  document
      shall pay a penalty not exceeding ten thousand dollars.
        (2)  For  purposes  of  paragraph  one  of  this subdivision, the term
      "procures" includes ordering (or otherwise causing) a subordinate to  do
      an  act, and knowing of, and not attempting to prevent, participation by
      a subordinate in an act. The term "subordinate" means any  other  person
      (whether  or not a director, officer, employee, or agent of the taxpayer
    
      involved) over whose activities the person has  direction,  supervision,
      or control.
        (3)  For  purposes  of  paragraph  one  of  this subdivision, a person
      furnishing typing, reproducing,  or  other  mechanical  assistance  with
      respect  to  a document shall not be treated as having aided or assisted
      in the preparation of such document by reason of such assistance.
        (4) The penalty imposed by this subdivision shall be  in  addition  to
      any other penalty provided by law.

      officer or employee of the department of finance of the city, any person
      engaged or retained by such department on an independent contract basis,
      the tax appeals tribunal, any commissioner or employee of such tribunal,
      or any person who, pursuant to this section, is permitted to inspect any
      return  or  to  whom  a  copy, an abstract or a portion of any return is
      furnished, or to  whom  any  information  contained  in  any  return  is
      furnished,  to  divulge  or  make  known  in  any manner any information
      relating to the business of a taxpayer contained in any return  required
      under  this  chapter.  The  officers  charged  with  the custody of such
      returns shall not be required to produce any  of  them  or  evidence  of
      anything  contained  in  them  in any action or proceeding in any court,
      except on behalf  of  the  commissioner  of  finance  in  an  action  or
      proceeding  under  the  provisions  of this chapter, or on behalf of any
      party to any action or proceeding under the provisions of  this  chapter
      when  the  returns  or facts shown thereby are directly involved in such
      action or proceeding, in either of which events the courts  may  require
      the  production of, and may admit in evidence so much of said returns or
      of the facts shown thereby, as are pertinent to the action or proceeding
      and no more. Nothing herein shall be construed to prohibit the  delivery
      to  a  taxpayer  or  the  taxpayer's duly authorized representative of a
      certified copy of any return filed in connection with his  or  her  tax;
      nor  to prohibit the delivery of such a certified copy of such return or
      of any information contained in  or  relating  thereto,  to  the  United
      States  of  America  or any department thereof, the state of New York or
      any department thereof, any agency or any department of the city of  New
      York  provided  the  same  is  requested  for  official business; nor to

      corporation counsel or other legal representatives of the city or by the

      publication of statistics so classified as to prevent the identification
      of particular returns or items thereof.
        b. (1) Any officer or employee of the city who willfully violates  the
      provisions  of  subdivision  a  of  this section shall be dismissed from
      office and be incapable of holding any public office in this city for  a
      period of five years thereafter.
        (2) Cross-reference: For criminal penalties, see chapter forty of this
      title.

      paragraph (a) of subdivision two of section eighty-seven of  the  public
      officers law.
        d.  Notwithstanding  anything  in subdivision a of this section to the
      contrary, if a taxpayer has petitioned  the  tax  appeals  tribunal  for
      administrative  review as provided in section one hundred seventy of the
      charter, the commissioner of finance shall be authorized to  present  to
      the  tribunal  any report or return of such taxpayer, or any information
      contained therein or relating thereto, which may be material or relevant
      to the proceeding before the tribunal. The tax appeals tribunal shall be
      authorized to publish a copy or  a  summary  of  any  decision  rendered
      pursuant to section one hundred seventy-one of the charter.

Section 11-717 ::    
        
     
        ยง  11-717  Notices and limitation of time. a. Any notice authorized or
      required under the provisions of this chapter may be given to the person
      for whom it is intended by mailing it in a postpaid  envelope  addressed
      to  such  person  at  the address given in the last return filed by such
      person pursuant to the provisions of this chapter or in any  application
      made  by such person or if no return has been filed or application made,
      then to such address as may be obtainable. The mailing of a notice as in
      this paragraph provided for shall be presumptive evidence of the receipt
      of the same by the person to whom addressed. Any period of time which is
      determined according to the provisions of this chapter by the giving  of
      notice  shall commence to run from the date of mailing of such notice as
      in this subdivision provided.
        b. The provisions of the civil practice law and rules or any other law
      relative to limitations of time for the enforcement of  a  civil  remedy
      shall  not  apply to any proceeding or action taken by the city to levy,
      appraise, assess, determine or enforce the  collection  of  any  tax  or
      penalty  provided  by  this  chapter.  However,  except in the case of a
      wilfully false or fraudulent return with intent to  evade  the  tax,  no
      assessment  of additional tax shall be made after the expiration of more
      than three years from the date of the final return for the tax  year  to
      which  the  assessment  relates; provided, however, that where no return
      has been made as provided by law, the tax may be assessed at any time.
        c. Where before the expiration of the period prescribed herein for the
      assessment of an additional tax, a person has consented in writing  that
      such  period  be  extended, the amount of such additional tax due may be
      determined at any time  within  such  extended  period.  The  period  so
      extended  may be further extended by subsequent consents in writing made
      before the expiration of the extended period.
        d. If any return, claim,  statement,  notice,  application,  or  other
      document  required  to  be  filed,  or  any payment required to be made,
      within a prescribed period or on  or  before  a  prescribed  date  under
      authority of any provision of this chapter is, after such period or such
      date,  delivered  by  United States mail to the commissioner of finance,
      the tax appeals tribunal, bureau, office, officer or person  with  which
      or  with  whom  such document is required to be filed, or to which or to
      whom such payment is required to be made, the date of the United  States
      postmark  stamped  on  the  envelope  shall  be deemed to be the date of
      delivery. This subdivision shall apply only if the postmark  date  falls
      within the prescribed period or on or before the prescribed date for the
      filing  of  such  document,  or  for  making  the payment, including any
      extension granted for such filing or payment, and only if such  document
      or  payment  was  deposited  in  the  mail,  postage  prepaid,  properly
      addressed to the commissioner of  finance,  the  tax  appeals  tribunal,
      bureau,  office,  officer or person with which or with whom the document
      is required to be filed or to which or to whom such payment is  required
      to  be  made.  If any document is sent by United States registered mail,
      such registration shall be prima facie evidence that such  document  was
      delivered  to  the  commissioner  of  finance, the tax appeals tribunal,
      bureau, office, officer or person to which or to whom addressed, and the
      date of registration shall be deemed the postmark date. The commissioner
      of finance or, where relevant, the tax appeals tribunal is authorized to
      provide by  regulation  the  extent  to  which  the  provisions  of  the
      preceding  sentence with respect to prima facie evidence of delivery and
      the postmark date shall apply to certified mail. Except as  provided  in
      subdivision  f of this section, this subdivision shall apply in the case
      of postmarks not made by the United States postal service only if and to
      the extent provided by regulation of the  commissioner  of  finance  or,
      where relevant, the tax appeals tribunal.
    
        e.  When  the  last  day  prescribed  under  authority of this chapter
      (including any extension of time) for performing  any  act  falls  on  a
      Saturday,  Sunday or legal holiday in the state, the performance of such
      act shall be considered timely if it is performed on the next succeeding
      day which is not a Saturday, Sunday or legal holiday.
        f.  (1)  Any  reference in subdivision d of this section to the United
      States mail shall be treated as including a reference  to  any  delivery
      service designated by the secretary of the treasury of the United States
      pursuant  to  section  seventy-five  hundred two of the internal revenue
      code and any reference in subdivision d of  this  section  to  a  United
      States  postmark  shall  be treated as including a reference to any date
      recorded or marked in  the  manner  described  in  section  seventy-five
      hundred  two  of  the  internal  revenue  code  by a designated delivery
      service. If the commissioner of finance finds that any delivery  service
      designated  by  such  secretary is inadequate for the needs of the city,
      the commissioner of finance may withdraw such designation  for  purposes
      of this title. The commissioner of finance may also designate additional
      delivery  services  meeting the criteria of section seventy-five hundred
      two of the internal revenue code for purposes  of  this  title,  or  may
      withdraw  any such designation if the commissioner of finance finds that
      a delivery service so designated is inadequate  for  the  needs  of  the
      city.  Any  reference  in  subdivision  d  of this section to the United
      States mail shall be treated as including a reference  to  any  delivery
      service  designated  by the commissioner of finance and any reference in
      subdivision d of this section to  a  United  States  postmark  shall  be
      treated  as  including a reference to any date recorded or marked in the
      manner described in section seventy-five hundred  two  of  the  internal
      revenue  code  by  a  delivery service designated by the commissioner of
      finance. Notwithstanding the foregoing, any withdrawal of designation or
      additional designation by the  commissioner  of  finance  shall  not  be
      effective  for purposes of service upon the tax appeals tribunal, unless
      and until such withdrawal of designation or  additional  designation  is
      ratified by the president of the tax appeals tribunal.
        (2)  Any  equivalent of registered or certified mail designated by the
      United States secretary of the treasury, or as may be designated by  the
      commissioner  of  finance  pursuant  to  the  same criteria used by such
      secretary for such designations pursuant to section seventy-five hundred
      two of the internal revenue code, shall be included within  the  meaning
      of  registered  or  certified  mail  as  used  in  subdivision d of this
      section. If the commissioner of finance finds  that  any  equivalent  of
      registered  or  certified  mail  designated  by  such  secretary  or the
      commissioner of finance is inadequate for the needs  of  the  city,  the
      commissioner  of  finance  may withdraw such designation for purposes of
      this title. Notwithstanding the foregoing, any withdrawal of designation
      or additional designation by the commissioner of finance  shall  not  be
      effective  for purposes of service upon the tax appeals tribunal, unless
      and until such withdrawal of designation or  additional  designation  is
      ratified by the president of the tax appeals tribunal.
