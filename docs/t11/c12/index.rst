Section 11-1206
---------------

Section 11-1206 ::    
        
     
        §  11-1206  Determination of tax. If a return required by this chapter
      is not filed, or if a return when filed is incorrect or insufficient the
      amount of tax due shall be determined by  the  commissioner  of  finance
      from  such  information  as may be obtainable and, if necessary, the tax
      may be estimated on the basis of external indices,  such  as  number  of
      race  meetings  held, admissions, paid attendance, and/or other factors.
      Notice of such determination shall be given to the person liable for the
      collection and/or payment of the tax. Such determination  shall  finally
      and  irrevocably  fix  the  tax  unless  the  person  against whom it is
      assessed,  within  ninety  days  after  giving  the   notice   of   such
      determination,  or,  if  the  commissioner  of finance has established a
      conciliation procedure pursuant to section 11-124 of the  code  and  the
      taxpayer   has   requested   a  conciliation  conference  in  accordance
      therewith, within  ninety  days  from  the  mailing  of  a  conciliation
      decision   or  the  date  of  the  commissioner's  confirmation  of  the
      discontinuance  of  the  conciliation  proceeding,  both  (1)  serves  a
      petition  upon the commissioner of finance and (2) files a petition with
      the tax appeals tribunal for a hearing, or unless  the  commissioner  of
      finance  of  his  or  her  own  motion  shall redetermine the same. Such
      hearing and any appeal to the tax appeals tribunal sitting en banc  from
      the  decision  rendered in such hearing shall be conducted in the manner
      and subject to the requirements prescribed by the tax  appeals  tribunal
      pursuant  to  sections  one  hundred  sixty-eight  through  one  hundred
      seventy-two of the charter. After such hearing the tax appeals  tribunal
      shall  give  notice of its decision to the person liable for the tax and
      to the commissioner of finance. A decision of the tax  appeals  tribunal
      sitting   en   banc   shall  be  reviewable  for  error,  illegality  or
      unconstitutionality or any other reason whatsoever by a proceeding under
      article seventy-eight of the civil practice law and rules if application
      therefor is made to the supreme court by the person against whom the tax
      was assessed within four months after the giving of the notice  of  such
      tax  appeals tribunal decision. A proceeding under article seventy-eight
      of the civil practice law and rules shall not be instituted by a  person
      liable  for  the  tax unless the amount of any tax sought to be reviewed
      with interest and penalties thereon, if any, shall  be  first  deposited
      with  the  commissioner  of  finance  and  there shall be filed with the
      commissioner of finance an  undertaking,  issued  by  a  surety  company
      authorized  to  transact  business  in  this  state  and approved by the
      superintendent  of  insurance  of  this  state  as   to   solvency   and
      responsibility,  in  such amount as a justice of the supreme court shall
      approve to the effect that if such proceeding be dismissed  or  the  tax
      confirmed,  such  person will pay all costs and charges which may accrue
      in the prosecution of the proceeding, or at the option  of  such  person
      such  undertaking filed with the commissioner of finance may be in a sum
      sufficient to cover the taxes, penalties and interest thereon stated  in
      such  decision plus the costs and charges which may accrue against it in
      the prosecution of the proceeding, in which event such person shall  not
      be required to deposit such taxes, penalties and interest as a condition
      precedent to the application.
    
    
    
    
    
    
    

Section 11-1207
---------------

Section 11-1207 ::    
        
     
        §  11-1207  Refunds.  a.  In  the  manner provided in this section the
      commissioner of finance shall refund or credit,  without  interest,  any
      tax,  penalty  or interest erroneously, illegally, or unconstitutionally
      collected or paid if application to the commissioner of finance for such
      refund shall be made within one year from the payment thereof.  Whenever
      a  refund or credit is made or denied by the commissioner of finance, he
      or she shall state his or her reason therefor and give notice thereof to
      the applicant in writing. The commissioner of finance may,  in  lieu  of
      any  refund  required  to be made, allow credit therefor on payments due
      from the applicant.
        b. Any determination of the commissioner of finance denying  a  refund
      or  credit  pursuant to subdivision a of this section shall be final and
      irrevocable unless the applicant  for  such  refund  or  credit,  within
      ninety days from the mailing of notice of such determination, or, if the
      commissioner  of  finance  has  established  a  conciliation  procedure,
      pursuant to section 11-124 of the code and the applicant has requested a
      conciliation conference in accordance therewith, within ninety  days  of
      the mailing of a conciliation decision or the date of the commissioner's
      confirmation  of the discontinuance of the conciliation proceeding, both
      (1) serves a petition upon the commissioner of finance and (2)  files  a
      petition  with the tax appeals tribunal for a hearing. Such petition for
      a refund or  credit,  made  as  herein  provided,  shall  be  deemed  an
      application  for  a  revision of any tax, penalty or interest complained
      of. Such hearing and any appeal to the tax appeals tribunal  sitting  en
      banc  from  the  decision rendered in such hearing shall be conducted in
      the manner and subject to the requirements prescribed by the tax appeals
      tribunal pursuant to section one hundred sixty-eight through one hundred
      seventy-two of the charter. After such hearing, the tax appeals tribunal
      shall  give  notice  of  its  decision  to  the  applicant  and  to  the
      commissioner  of finance. The applicant shall be entitled to institute a
      proceeding pursuant to article seventy-eight of the civil  practice  law
      and  rules  to  review a decision of the tax appeals tribunal sitting en
      banc, provided such proceeding is instituted within  four  months  after
      the  giving of the notice of such decision, and provided, in the case of
      an  application  by  a  person  liable  for  the  tax,  that   a   final
      determination  of  tax  due  was  not previously made. Such a proceeding
      shall not be instituted by  a  person  liable  for  the  tax  unless  an
      undertaking is filed with the commissioner of finance in such amount and
      with  such  sureties  as a justice of the supreme court shall approve to
      the effect that if such proceeding be dismissed or  the  tax  confirmed,
      such  person  will  pay  all  costs  and charges which may accrue in the
      prosecution of such proceeding.
        c. A person shall not be entitled to  a  revision,  refund  or  credit
      under  this  section  of  a  tax,  interest  or  penalty  which has been
      determined to be due pursuant to the provisions of  section  11-1206  of
      this chapter where such person has had a hearing or an opportunity for a
      hearing,  as provided in said section, or has failed to avail himself or
      herself of the remedies therein provided. No refund or credit  shall  be
      made  of  a  tax,  interest or penalty paid after a determination by the
      commissioner of finance made pursuant to section 11-1206 of this chapter
      unless it be found that such determination  was  erroneous,  illegal  or
      unconstitutional  or  otherwise  improper,  by  the tax appeals tribunal
      after a hearing or of the commissioner's own motion,  or,  if  such  tax
      appeals  tribunal  affirms  in whole or in part the determination of the
      commissioner of finance, in a proceeding under article seventy-eight  of
      the  civil  practice  law  and rules, pursuant to the provisions of said
      section, in which event refund or credit without interest shall be  made
      of the tax, interest or penalty found to have been overpaid.
    
    
    
    
    
    
    

Section 11-1208
---------------

Section 11-1208 ::    
        
     
        §  11-1208  Reserves. In cases where a person has applied for a refund
      and has instituted a proceeding under article seventy-eight of the civil
      practice law and rules to review a determination adverse to such  person
      on  his  or  her  application  for  refund, the comptroller shall set up
      appropriate reserves to meet any decision adverse to the city.
    
    
    
    
    
    
    

Section 11-1209
---------------

Section 11-1209 ::    
        
     
        §  11-1209  Remedies  exclusive.  The  remedies  provided  by sections
      11-1206  and  11-1207  of  this  chapter  shall  be  exclusive  remedies
      available  to any person for the review of tax liability imposed by this
      chapter, and no  determination  or  proposed  determination  of  tax  or
      determination  on  any  application  for  refund  by the commissioner of
      finance, nor any decision by the tax appeals  tribunal  or  any  of  its
      administrative  law  judges,  shall be enjoined or reviewed by an action
      for declaratory judgment, an action for money had and received or by any
      action or proceeding other than, in the case of a decision  by  the  tax
      appeals  tribunal  sitting  en  banc,  a  proceeding  in the nature of a
      certiorari proceeding under article seventy-eight of the civil  practice
      law  and  rules;  provided,  however,  that  such  person may proceed by
      declaratory judgment if such person institutes suit within  ninety  days
      after  a  deficiency  assessment  is  made  and  pays  the amount of the
      deficiency assessment to  the  commissioner  of  finance  prior  to  the
      institution  of  such  suit  and  posts  a bond for costs as provided in
      section 11-1206 of this chapter.
    
    
    
    
    
    
    

Section 11-1210
---------------

Section 11-1210 ::    
        
     
        §   11-1210  Proceedings  to  recover  tax.  a.  Whenever  any  racing
      corporation or association or any of its officers or  any  other  person
      shall fail to collect and pay over any tax or to pay any tax, penalty or
      interest  imposed  by  this chapter as therein provided, the corporation
      counsel shall, upon the request of the commissioner of finance bring  or
      cause  to  be  brought  an  action to enforce the payment of the same on
      behalf of the city of New York in any court of the state of New York  or
      of   any  other  state  or  of  the  United  States.  If,  however,  the
      commissioner of finance in his or her discretion believes that a  person
      subject  to  the  provisions of this chapter is about to cease business,
      leave the state or remove or dissipate the assets out of which  the  tax
      or  penalties  might be satisfied, and that any such tax or penalty will
      not be paid when due, the commissioner of finance may declare  such  tax
      or  penalty  to  be  immediately due and payable and may issue a warrant
      immediately.
        b. As an additional or alternate remedy, the commissioner  of  finance
      may issue a warrant, directed to the city sheriff commanding the sheriff
      to  levy  upon  and  sell  the  real and personal property of the racing
      corporation or association or its officers or any other person which may
      be found within the city, for the payment of the  amount  thereof,  with
      any  penalties  and interest, and the cost of executing the warrant, and
      to return such warrant to the commissioner of finance and to pay to  the
      commissioner  of  finance  the  money collected by virtue thereof within
      sixty days after the receipt of such warrant.  The  city  sheriff  shall
      within  five  days after the receipt of the warrant file with the county
      clerk a copy thereof, and  thereupon  such  clerk  shall  enter  in  the
      judgment  docket the name of the person mentioned in the warrant and the
      amount of the tax, penalties and  interest  for  which  the  warrant  is
      issued  and  the  date  when such copy is filed. Thereupon the amount of
      such warrant so docketed shall become a  lien  upon  the  title  to  and
      interest  in  real  and personal property of the person against whom the
      warrant is issued. The city sheriff shall then proceed upon the  warrant
      in  the  same  manner,  and with like effect, as that provided by law in
      respect to executions issued against property upon judgments of a  court
      of  record  and  for services in executing the warrants the city sheriff
      shall be entitled to the same fees, which the city sheriff  may  collect
      in  the  same manner. In the discretion of the commissioner of finance a
      warrant of like terms, force and effect may be issued  and  directed  to
      any  officer  or  employee  of  the  department  of  finance, and in the
      execution thereof such officer or employee shall  have  all  the  powers
      conferred  by  law  upon  sheriffs,  but  shall be entitled to no fee or
      compensation in excess of the actual expenses paid in the performance of
      such duty.  If  a  warrant  is  returned  not  satisfied  in  full,  the
      commissioner  of  finance  may  from time to time issue new warrants and
      shall also have the same remedies to enforce the amount  due  thereunder
      as if the city had recovered judgment therefor and execution thereon had
      been returned unsatisfied.
        c.  Whenever  a corporation or association shall make a sale, transfer
      or assignment in bulk or any part or  the  whole  of  its  race  meeting
      grounds  or  enclosures  and the building and structures thereon, or its
      lease, license or other agreement or right to possess  or  operate  such
      race  meeting  grounds  or  enclosures  or  of the equipment, machinery,
      fixtures or supplies, or of the said race meeting grounds or  enclosures
      and  the  building  and  structures  thereon, or lease, license or other
      agreement or right to possess or operate such race  meeting  grounds  or
      enclosures,   and   the   equipment,  machinery,  fixtures  or  supplies
      pertaining to the conduct or the operation  of  the  said  race  meeting
      grounds  or  enclosures,  otherwise than in the ordinary course of trade
    
      and  in  the  regular  prosecution  of  said  business,  the  purchaser,
      transferee  or assignee shall at least ten days before taking possession
      of such  race  meeting  grounds  or  enclosures  and  the  building  and
      structures  thereon,  or  lease,  license or other agreement or right to
      possess or operate such  race  meeting  grounds  or  enclosures  or  the
      equipment,  machinery, fixtures or supplies, or of the said race meeting
      grounds or enclosures and the building and structures thereon, or lease,
      license or other agreement or right to  possess  or  operate  such  race
      meeting grounds or enclosures, and the equipment, machinery, fixtures or
      supplies  or  paying  thereof,  notify  the  commissioner  of finance by
      registered mail of the  proposed  sale  and  of  the  price,  terms  and
      conditions  thereof  whether  or not the seller, transferor or assignor,
      has represented to, or informed the purchaser,  transferee  or  assignee
      that  it  owes  any  tax pursuant to this chapter and whether or not the
      purchaser, transferee or assignee has  knowledge  that  such  taxes  are
      owing, and whether any such taxes are in fact owing.
        Whenever  the  purchaser,  transferee  or  assignee shall fail to give
      notice to the commissioner of  finance  as  required  by  the  preceding
      paragraph,  or  whenever  the  commissioner  of finance shall inform the
      purchaser, transferee or assignee that a possible claim for such tax  or
      taxes  exists, any sums of money, property or choses in action, or other
      consideration, which the purchaser, transferee or assignee  is  required
      to  transfer over to the seller, transferor or assignor shall be subject
      to a first priority right and lien for any  such  taxes  theretofore  or
      thereafter  determined to be due from the seller, transferor or assignor
      to the city, and the purchaser, transferee or assignee is  forbidden  to
      transfer  to  the seller, transferor or assignor any such sums of money,
      property or choses in action to the extent of the amount of  the  city's
      claim.  For  failure  to comply with the provisions of this subdivision,
      the purchaser, transferee or assignee, in addition to being  subject  to
      the liabilities and remedies imposed under the provisions of article six
      of  the  uniform  commercial  code,  shall  be personally liable for the
      payment to  the  city  of  any  such  taxes  theretofore  or  thereafter
      determined  to  be  due  to  the  city  from  the  seller, transferor or
      assignor, and such liability may be assessed and enforced  in  the  same
      manner as the liability for tax under this chapter.
        d.  The commissioner of finance, if he or she finds that the interests
      of the city will not thereby be jeopardized, and upon such conditions as
      the commissioner of finance may require, may release any  property  from
      the  lien  of  any  warrant  or  vacate  such  warrant for unpaid taxes,
      additions to tax, penalties and interest filed pursuant to subdivision b
      of this section, and such release or vacating  of  the  warrant  may  be
      recorded  in  the  office of any recording officer in which such warrant
      has been filed. The clerk shall thereupon cancel and discharge as of the
      original date of docketing the vacated warrant.

Section 11-1213 ::    
        
     
        §  11-1213  Interest  and penalties. (a) Interest on underpayments. If
      any amount of tax is not paid over or paid on or before  the  last  date
      prescribed  for payment (without regard to any extension of time granted
      for  payment),  interest  on  such  amount  at  the  rate  set  by   the
      commissioner of finance pursuant to subdivision (g) of this section, or,
      if  no rate is set, at the rate of seven and one-half percent per annum,
      shall be paid for the period from such last date to the date of payment.
      In computing the amount of interest to be paid, such interest  shall  be
      compounded  daily.  Interest under this subdivision shall not be paid if
      the amount thereof is less than one dollar.
        (b) * (1) Failure to file return. (A) In case of  failure  to  file  a
      return  under  this chapter on or before the prescribed date (determined
      with regard to any extension of time for filing),  unless  it  is  shown
      that  such  failure  is  due  to reasonable cause and not due to willful
      neglect, there shall be added to the amount required to be shown as  tax
      on  such return five percent of the amount of such tax if the failure is
      for not more than one month, with an additional five  percent  for  each
      additional   month   or  fraction  thereof  during  which  such  failure
      continues, not exceeding twenty-five percent in the aggregate.
        (B) In the case of a failure to file a return of tax within sixty days
      of the date prescribed for filing of such return (determined with regard
      to any extension of time for filing),  unless  it  is  shown  that  such
      failure  is  due to reasonable cause and not due to willful neglect, the
      addition to tax under subparagraph (A) of this paragraph  shall  not  be
      less  than  the  lesser of one hundred dollars or one hundred percent of
      the amount required to be shown as tax on such return.
        (C) For purposes of this paragraph, the amount of tax required  to  be
      shown  on  the  return shall be reduced by the amount of any part of the
      tax which is paid on or before the date prescribed for  payment  of  the
      tax and by the amount of any credit against the tax which may be claimed
      upon the return.
        * NB Amended Ch. 765/85 § 35, language juxtaposed per Ch. 907/85 § 14
        (2)  Failure to pay tax shown on return. In case of failure to pay the
      amount shown as tax on a return required to be filed under this  chapter
      on  or  before  the  prescribed  date  (determined  with  regard  to any
      extension of time for payment), unless it is shown that such failure  is
      due  to  reasonable cause and not due to willful neglect, there shall be
      added to the amount shown as tax on such return one-half of one  percent
      of the amount of such tax if the failure is not for more than one month,
      with  an additional one-half of one percent for each additional month or
      fraction thereof during which  such  failure  continues,  not  exceeding
      twenty-five  percent  in the aggregate. For the purpose of computing the
      addition for any month the amount of tax shown on the  return  shall  be
      reduced  by the amount of any part of the tax which is paid on or before
      the beginning of such month and by the amount of any credit against  the
      tax  which may be claimed upon the return. If the amount of tax required
      to be shown on a return is less than the amount shown  as  tax  on  such
      return,  this  paragraph  shall  be  applied  by substituting such lower
      amount.
        (3) Failure to pay tax required to be shown  on  return.  In  case  of
      failure  to pay any amount in respect of any tax required to be shown on
      a return required to be filed under this chapter which is not  so  shown
      (including  a  determination  made  pursuant  to section 11-1206 of this
      chapter) within ten days of the date of a notice  and  demand  therefor,
      unless  it is shown that such failure is due to reasonable cause and not
      due to willful neglect, there shall be added to the amount of tax stated
      in such notice and demand one-half of one percent of  such  tax  if  the
      failure  is  not for more than one month, with an additional one-half of
    
      one percent for each additional month or fraction thereof  during  which
      such  failure  continues,  not  exceeding  twenty-five  percent  in  the
      aggregate. For the purpose of computing the addition for any month,  the
      amount  of  tax  stated in the notice and demand shall be reduced by the
      amount of any part of the tax which is paid before the beginning of such
      month.
        * (4) Limitations on additions.
        (A) With respect to any return,  the  amount  of  the  addition  under
      paragraph  one of this subdivision shall be reduced by the amount of the
      under paragraph two of this  subdivision  for  any  month  to  which  an
      addition  applies  under  both  paragraphs  one  and  two.  In  any case
      described in subparagraph (B) of paragraph one of this subdivision,  the
      amount  of  the  addition  under such paragraph one shall not be reduced
      below the amount provided in such subparagraph.
        (B) With respect to any return, the maximum  amount  of  the  addition
      permitted  under paragraph three of this subdivision shall be reduced by
      the amount of the addition  under  paragraph  one  of  this  subdivision
      (determined  without  regard  to subparagraph (B) of such paragraph one)
      which is attributable to the tax for which the notice and demand is made
      and which is not paid within ten days of such notice and demand.
        * NB Amended Ch. 765/85 § 35, language juxtaposed per Ch. 907/85 § 14
        * (c)  Underpayment  due  to  negligence.  (1)  If  any  part  of   an
      underpayment  of  tax  is  due to negligence or intentional disregard of
      this chapter or any rules or regulations hereunder (but  without  intent
      to  defraud),  there  shall  be added to the tax a penalty equal to five
      percent of the underpayment.
        (2) There shall be added  to  the  tax  (in  addition  to  the  amount
      determined  under  paragraph one of this subdivision) an amount equal to
      fifty percent of the interest payable  under  subdivision  (a)  of  this
      section  with  respect  to  the portion of the underpayment described in
      such  paragraph  one  which  is  attributable  to  the   negligence   or
      intentional  disregard referred to in such paragraph one, for the period
      beginning on the last  date  prescribed  by  law  for  payment  of  such
      underpayment  (determined without regard to any extension) and ending on
      the date of the assessment of the tax (or, if earlier, the date  of  the
      payment of the tax).
        * NB Amended Ch. 765/85 § 35, language juxtaposed per Ch. 907/85 § 14
        * (d) Underpayment due to fraud. (1) If any part of an underpayment of
      tax  is due to fraud, there shall be added to the tax a penalty equal to
      fifty percent of the underpayment.
        (2) There shall be added to  the  tax  (in  addition  to  the  penalty
      determined  under  paragraph one of this subdivision) an amount equal to
      fifty percent of the interest payable  under  subdivision  (a)  of  this
      section  with  respect  to  the portion of the underpayment described in
      such paragraph one which  is  attributable  to  fraud,  for  the  period
      beginning  on  the  last  day  prescribed  by  law  for  payment of such
      underpayment (determined without regard to any extension) and ending  on
      the  date  of the assessment of the tax (or, if earlier, the date of the
      payment of the tax).
        (3) The penalty under this subdivision shall be in lieu of  any  other
      addition to tax imposed by subdivision (b) or (c) of this section.
        * NB Amended Ch. 765/85 § 35, language juxtaposed per Ch. 907/85 § 14
        (e)  Additional penalty. Any person who, with fraudulent intent, shall
      fail to pay any tax imposed by this chapter, or to make, render, sign or
      certify any return,  or  to  supply  any  information  within  the  time
      required  by or under this chapter, shall be liable for a penalty of not
      more than one  thousand  dollars,  in  addition  to  any  other  amounts
      required under this chapter to be imposed, assessed and collected by the
    
      commissioner  of  finance.  The  commissioner  of finance shall have the
      power, in his or her discretion, to  waive,  reduce  or  compromise  any
      penalty under this subdivision.
        (f)  The  interest and penalties imposed by this section shall be paid
      and disposed of in the same manner as other revenues from this  chapter.
      Unpaid  interest and penalties may be enforced in the same manner as the
      tax imposed by this chapter.
        (g) (1) Authority to set interest rates. The commissioner  of  finance
      shall set the rate of interest to be paid pursuant to subdivision (a) of
      this section, but if no such rate of interest is set, such rate shall be
      deemed  to  be  set  at  seven and one-half percent per annum. Such rate
      shall be the rate prescribed in paragraph two of  this  subdivision  but
      shall  not  be  less than seven and one-half percent per annum. Any such
      rate set by the commissioner of finance shall apply  to  taxes,  or  any
      portion  thereof,  which  remain  or  become due on or after the date on
      which such rate becomes effective and shall apply only with  respect  to
      interest  computed  or  computable  for  periods  or portions of periods
      occurring in the period in which such rate is in effect.
        (2) General rule. The rate of  interest  set  under  this  subdivision
      shall  be  the  sum of (i) the federal short-term rate as provided under
      paragraph three of this subdivision, plus (ii) seven percentage points.
        (3) Federal short-term rate. For purposes of this subdivision:
        (A) The federal short-term rate for any month  shall  be  the  federal
      short-term  rate  determined  by  the  United  States  secretary  of the
      treasury during such month in accordance with subsection (d) of  section
      twelve  hundred  seventy-four  of  the  internal revenue code for use in
      connection with section six  thousand  six  hundred  twenty-one  of  the
      internal  revenue  code.  Any  such rate shall be rounded to the nearest
      full percent (or, if a multiple of one-half of one  percent,  such  rate
      shall be increased to the next highest full percent).
        (B) Period during which rate applies.
        (i)   In   general.   Except  as  provided  in  clause  (ii)  of  this
      subparagraph, the federal short-term rate for the first  month  in  each
      calendar quarter shall apply during the first calendar quarter beginning
      after such month.
        (ii)  Special  rule  for  the  month  of  September,  nineteen hundred
      eighty-nine. The  federal  short-term  rate  for  the  month  of  April,
      nineteen  hundred  eighty-nine  shall  apply with respect to setting the
      rate  of  interest  for  the  month  of  September,   nineteen   hundred
      eighty-nine.
        (4)  Publication  of  interest rate. The commissioner of finance shall
      cause to be published in the city record,  and  give  other  appropriate
      general notice of, the interest rate to be set under this subdivision no
      later  than  twenty days preceding the first day of the calendar quarter
      during which such interest rate applies. The setting and publication  of
      such  interest  rate  shall  not  be  included  within  paragraph (a) of
      subdivision five of section one thousand forty-one of the  city  charter
      relating to the definition of a rule.
        * (h)   Miscellaneous.   (1)  Officers  of  a  racing  corporation  or
      association shall be personally liable for the tax collected or required
      to be collected  under  this  chapter,  and  subject  to  the  penalties
      hereinabove imposed.
        (2)  The certificate of the commissioner of finance to the effect that
      a tax has not been paid, that a return or bond has not  been  filed,  or
      that  information  has  not  been supplied pursuant to the provisions of
      this chapter, shall be presumptive evidence thereof.

        §  11-1214  Returns  to be secret. a. Except in accordance with proper
      judicial order, or as otherwise provided by law, it  shall  be  unlawful
      for  the  commissioner  of  finance  or  the tax appeals tribunal or any
      officer or employee of the department of  finance  to  divulge  or  make
      known  in  any manner any of the information relating to the business of
      any person contained in any return  required  under  this  chapter.  The
      officers  charged with the custody of such returns shall not be required
      to produce any of them or evidence of anything contained in them in  any
      action  or proceeding in any court, except on behalf of the commissioner
      of finance in an action or  proceeding  under  the  provisions  of  this
      chapter, or on behalf of any party to any action or proceeding under the
      provisions  of this chapter, when the returns or facts shown thereby are
      directly involved in such action  or  proceeding,  in  either  of  which
      events  the  courts  may  require  the  production  of, and may admit in
      evidence, so much of said returns or of the facts shown thereby, as  are
      pertinent  to  the action or proceeding and no more. The commissioner of
      finance  may,  nevertheless,  publish  a  copy  or  a  summary  of   any
      determination  or decision rendered after a formal hearing held pursuant
      to section 11-1206 or 11-1207 of this chapter. Nothing herein  shall  be
      construed  to  prohibit  the  delivery to a person or such person's duly
      authorized representative of a certified copy of  any  return  filed  by
      such  person nor to prohibit the publication of statistics so classified
      as to prevent the identification of particular  returns  and  the  items
      thereof,  or  the  inspection  by the corporation counsel or other legal
      representatives of the city, or by the district attorney of  any  county
      within  the  city, of the return of any person who shall bring action to
      set aside or review the tax based thereon, or against whom an action  or
      proceeding  has  been instituted for the collection of a tax or penalty.
      Nothing herein shall be construed to  prohibit  the  inspection  by  the
      fiscal  representatives  of  any  county  entitled to any portion of the
      revenues pursuant to subdivision b of section 11-1216 of this chapter of
      returns of tax collected at any  racing  ground  or  enclosure  situated
      partly  in  such  county. Returns shall be preserved for three years and
      thereafter  until  the  commissioner  of  finance  permits  them  to  be
      destroyed.
        b.  (1) Any officer or employee of the city who willfully violates the
      provisions of subdivision a of this  section  shall  be  dismissed  from
      office  and be incapable of holding any public office in this city for a
      period of five years thereafter.
        (2) Cross-reference: For criminal penalties, see chapter forty of this
      title.
        c. This section shall be  deemed  a  state  statute  for  purposes  of
      paragraph  (a)  of subdivision two of section eighty-seven of the public
      officers law.
        d. Notwithstanding anything in subdivision a of this  section  to  the
      contrary,  if  a  taxpayer  has  petitioned the tax appeals tribunal for
      administrative review as provided in section one hundred seventy of  the
      charter,  the  commissioner of finance shall be authorized to present to
      the tribunal any report or return of such taxpayer, or  any  information
      contained therein or relating thereto, which may be material or relevant
      to the proceeding before the tribunal. The tax appeals tribunal shall be
      authorized  to  publish  a  copy  or  a summary of any decision rendered
      pursuant to section one hundred seventy-one of the charter.

Section 11-1215 ::    
        
     
        § 11-1215 Notices and limitations of time. a. Any notice authorized or
      required  under  the  provisions of this chapter may be given by mailing
      the same to the person for whom it is intended in  a  postpaid  envelope
      addressed  to  such person at the address given in the last return filed
      by such person pursuant to the provisions of  this  chapter  or  in  any
      application  made  by  such  person  or  if  no return has been filed or
      application made, then to such address as may be obtainable. The mailing
      of such notice shall be presumptive evidence of the receipt of the  same
      by  the person to whom addressed. Any period of time which is determined
      according to the provisions of this chapter  by  the  giving  of  notice
      shall commence to run from the date of mailing of such notice.
        b. The provisions of the civil practice law and rules or any other law
      relative  to  limitations  of time for the enforcement of a civil remedy
      shall not apply to any proceeding or action taken by the city  to  levy,
      appraise,  assess,  determine  or  enforce  the collection of any tax or
      penalty provided by this chapter. However,  except  in  the  case  of  a
      wilfully  false  or  fraudulent  return with intent to evade the tax, no
      assessment of additional tax shall be made after the expiration of  more
      than three years from the date of the filing of a return, provided, that
      where  no  return  has  been  filed  as  provided  by law the tax may be
      assessed at any time.
        c. Where, before the expiration of the period  prescribed  herein  for
      the  assessment  of an additional tax, a person has consented in writing
      that such period be extended, the amount of such additional tax due  may
      be  determined  at  any  time within such extended period. The period so
      extended may be further extended by subsequent consents in writing  made
      before the expiration of the extended period.
        d.  If  any  return,  claim,  statement, notice, application, or other
      document required to be filed, or  any  payment  required  to  be  made,
      within  a  prescribed  period  or  on  or before a prescribed date under
      authority of any provision of this chapter is, after such period or such
      date, delivered by United States mail to the  commissioner  of  finance,
      the  tax  appeals tribunal, bureau, office, officer or person with which
      or with whom such document is required to be filed, or to  which  or  to
      whom  such payment is required to be made, the date of the United States
      postmark stamped on the envelope shall be  deemed  to  be  the  date  of
      delivery.  This  subdivision shall apply only if the postmark date falls
      within the prescribed period or on or before the prescribed date for the
      filing of such document,  or  for  making  the  payment,  including  any
      extension  granted for such filing or payment, and only if such document
      or  payment  was  deposited  in  the  mail,  postage  prepaid,  properly
      addressed  to  the  commissioner  of finance, bureau, office, officer or
      person with which or with whom the document is required to be  filed  or
      to which or to whom such payment is required to be made. If any document
      is  sent  by  United  States registered mail, such registration shall be
      prima  facie  evidence  that  such  document  was   delivered   to   the
      commissioner  of  finance,  the  tax  appeals  tribunal, bureau, office,
      officer or person to which  or  to  whom  addressed,  and  the  date  of
      registration  shall  be  deemed  the  postmark date. The commissioner of
      finance or, where relevant, the tax appeals tribunal  is  authorized  to
      provide  by  regulation  the  extent  to  which  the  provisions  of the
      preceding sentence with respect to prima facie evidence of delivery  and
      the  postmark  date shall apply to certified mail. Except as provided in
      subdivision f of this section, this subdivision shall apply in the  case
      of postmarks not made by the United States postal service only if and to
      the  extent  provided  by  regulation of the commissioner of finance or,
      where relevant, the tax appeals tribunal.
    
        e. When the last  day  prescribed  under  authority  of  this  chapter
      (including  any  extension  of  time)  for performing any act falls on a
      Saturday, Sunday or legal holiday in the state, the performance of  such
      act shall be considered timely if it is performed on the next succeeding
      day which is not a Saturday, Sunday or legal holiday.
        f.  (1)  Any  reference in subdivision d of this section to the United
      States mail shall be treated as including a reference  to  any  delivery
      service designated by the secretary of the treasury of the United States
      pursuant  to  section  seventy-five  hundred two of the internal revenue
      code and any reference in subdivision d of  this  section  to  a  United
      States  postmark  shall  be treated as including a reference to any date
      recorded or marked in  the  manner  described  in  section  seventy-five
      hundred  two  of  the  internal  revenue  code  by a designated delivery
      service. If the commissioner of finance finds that any delivery  service
      designated  by  such  secretary is inadequate for the needs of the city,
      the commissioner of finance may withdraw such designation  for  purposes
      of this title. The commissioner of finance may also designate additional
      delivery  services  meeting the criteria of section seventy-five hundred
      two of the internal revenue code for purposes  of  this  title,  or  may
      withdraw  any such designation if the commissioner of finance finds that
      a delivery service so designated is inadequate  for  the  needs  of  the
      city.  Any  reference  in  subdivision  d  of this section to the United
      States mail shall be treated as including a reference  to  any  delivery
      service  designated  by the commissioner of finance and any reference in
      subdivision d of this section to  a  United  States  postmark  shall  be
      treated  as  including a reference to any date recorded or marked in the
      manner described in section seventy-five hundred  two  of  the  internal
      revenue  code  by  a  delivery service designated by the commissioner of
      finance. Notwithstanding the foregoing, any withdrawal of designation or
      additional designation by the  commissioner  of  finance  shall  not  be
      effective  for purposes of service upon the tax appeals tribunal, unless
      and until such withdrawal of designation or  additional  designation  is
      ratified by the president of the tax appeals tribunal.
        (2)  Any  equivalent of registered or certified mail designated by the
      United States secretary of the treasury, or as may be designated by  the
      commissioner  of  finance  pursuant  to  the  same criteria used by such
      secretary for such designations pursuant to section seventy-five hundred
      two of the internal revenue code, shall be included within  the  meaning
      of  registered  or  certified  mail  as  used  in  subdivision d of this
      section. If the commissioner of finance finds  that  any  equivalent  of
      registered  or  certified  mail  designated  by  such  secretary  or the
      commissioner of finance is inadequate for the needs  of  the  city,  the
      commissioner  of  finance  may withdraw such designation for purposes of
      this title. Notwithstanding the foregoing, any withdrawal of designation
      or additional designation by the commissioner of finance  shall  not  be
      effective  for purposes of service upon the tax appeals tribunal, unless
      and until such withdrawal of designation or  additional  designation  is
      ratified by the president of the tax appeals tribunal.
