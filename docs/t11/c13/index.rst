      application,  the  commissioner  of finance shall grant and issue to the
      applicant a wholesale cigarette  license  for  each  place  of  business
      within  the  city set forth in the application. Cigarette licenses shall
      not be assignable and shall be valid only for the persons in whose names

      fee  of  fifteen  dollars.  A  duplicate  retail  dealer  license may be
      obtained from the  commissioner  of  consumer  affairs  as  provided  in
      section 20-204 of this code.
        d.  Suspension  or  revocation  of  licenses. (1) After a hearing, the

      license  and  the commissioner of consumer affairs, upon notice from the

      or duplicates thereof  issued  to  such  holder  and  the  holder  shall
      surrender  promptly  all such licenses to the commissioner of finance as
      directed. Before the commissioner  of  finance  suspends  or  revokes  a
      wholesale  cigarette  license  or  notifies the commissioner of consumer
      affairs of a finding of a violation of this chapter with  respect  to  a
    
      retail  cigarette license pursuant to paragraph (1) of this subdivision,
      he or she shall notify the holder and the holder shall be entitled to  a
      hearing,  if desired, if the holder, within ninety days from the date of
      such  notification, or, if the commissioner of finance has established a
      conciliation procedure pursuant to section 11-124 of the  code  and  the

      therewith, within  ninety  days  from  the  mailing  of  a  conciliation
      decision   or  the  date  of  the  commissioner's  confirmation  of  the

      notification, the commissioner of consumer affairs may suspend or revoke
      a retail cigarette license as  provided  in  subdivision  b  of  section

      issue an order prohibiting a retail dealer from selling cigarettes,  for
      such  period  as the order shall specify, for failure to comply with any
      of the provisions of this chapter or any rules  or  regulations  of  the
      commissioner  of  finance prescribed, adopted and promulgated under this
      chapter.
        g. License fees; numbering and registering of licenses; term.  1.  The

Section 11-1304 ::    
        
     
        ยง  11-1304  Preparation  and  sale  of  stamps;  commissions.  a.  The
      commissioner of finance shall, subject to the approval of the state  tax
      commission,  prescribe, prepare and furnish stamps of such denominations
      and quantities as may be necessary for the payment of the tax imposed by
      this chapter, and may, from time to time, provide for the  issuance  and
      exclusive  use of stamps of a new design and forbid the use of stamps of
      any other design. Such stamps shall be in the form of a single stamp for
      the payment of the tax imposed by this chapter or, in  lieu  thereof,  a
      joint  single  stamp  to be prepared and issued by the state of New York
      and the city for the payment of the tax imposed by this chapter and  the
      taxes  imposed  by  article  twenty  of the tax law. The commissioner of
      finance may make such arrangements with the state tax commission for the
      method of acquiring and the manner of sharing the costs  of  such  joint
      single  stamps  as  he  or  she  deems  appropriate. The commissioner of
      finance, subject to the approval of the state tax commission, shall make
      provisions for the sale of such stamps at such places as he or  she  may
      deem necessary, and may appoint fiscal agents for such purpose.
        b.  The  commissioner  of  finance  may  appoint  wholesale dealers of
      cigarettes and any other person within or without the city as agents  to
      affix  stamps  to be used in paying the tax hereby imposed, but an agent
      shall at all times have the right to appoint the person in  his  or  her
      employ  who  is  to affix the stamps to any cigarettes under the agent's
      control. Whenever the commissioner of finance  shall  sell,  consign  or
      deliver  to any such agent any such stamps, such agent shall be entitled
      to receive as compensation for his  or  her  services  and  expenses  in
      affixing  such stamps, and to retain out of the moneys to be paid by the
      agent for such stamps, a  commission  on  the  par  value  thereof.  The
      commissioner  of finance is hereby authorized to prescribe a schedule of
      commissions not exceeding five per centum, allowable to such  agent  for
      affixing  such  stamps;  provided,  however,  that  the  commissioner of
      finance may authorize commissions to agents  and  temporary  agents  not
      exceeding ten per centum for a special period not exceeding fifteen days
      immediately following the enactment of this chapter to cover the initial
      stamping  of  packages of cigarettes. Such schedule shall be uniform for
      each type and denomination of stamp used, and  may  be  on  a  graduated
      scale  with respect to the number of stamps purchased. In the event that
      a joint stamp is issued, the commissions  allowed  shall  be  determined
      jointly  by the state tax commission and the commissioner of finance and
      shall be based on the full par value of such stamp. The extent to  which
      the  city  and  the  state  of  New  York shall bear the expense of such
      commissions shall be determined  by  agreement  between  the  state  tax
      commission  and the commissioner of finance. The commissioner of finance
      may in his or her discretion permit an agent  to  pay  for  such  stamps
      within  thirty  days  after the date of sale, consignment or delivery of
      such stamps to such agents, and may require any such agent to file  with
      the  commissioner of finance a bond, issued by a surety company approved
      by the superintendent of insurance as to solvency and responsibility and
      authorized to transact business in the state, in  such  amounts  as  the
      commissioner  of finance may fix, to secure the payment of any sums from
      such agent pursuant to this chapter.
        c. The commissioner of finance may redeem unused  stamps  lawfully  in
      the possession of any person. No person shall sell or offer for sale any
      stamp  issued  under  this  chapter, except by written permission of the
      commissioner of finance. The commissioner of finance may prescribe rules
      and regulations concerning refunds,  sales  of  stamps  and  redemptions
      under the provisions of this chapter.
        d.  (1)  Except  as provided in this subdivision, it shall be unlawful
      for any person to sell, offer for sale, possess or transport any affixed
    
      or  unaffixed  false,  altered  or  counterfeit  cigarette  tax  stamps,
      imprints or impressions.
        (2) Paragraph one of this subdivision shall not apply to:
        (A)  a  person, other than a retail dealer, in possession of twenty or
      fewer affixed tax stamps;
        (B) public officers or employees in the performance of their  official
      duties  requiring  possession  or control of affixed or unaffixed false,
      altered or counterfeit cigarette tax stamps, imprints or impressions; or
        (C) any person authorized  by  the  commissioner  of  finance  or  the
      commissioner  of  the department of taxation and finance of the state of
      New York to perform law enforcement functions.

      agent  shall  affix  to each package of cigarettes stamps evidencing the
      payment of tax imposed by this chapter  and  shall  cancel  such  stamps
      prior  to  delivery of such cigarettes to any dealer in the city, unless

      before such agent received them.
        b.  Each  dealer,  other  than an agent, in the city shall immediately
      upon the receipt of any cigarettes at his or her place of business  mark
      in  ink  on  each  unopened  box,  carton  or  other  container  of such
      cigarettes the word "received" and the year, month, day and hour of such
      receipt and shall affix his or her signature thereto or shall mark  them
      in  any  other  manner  prescribed  by  the  commissioner of finance. In
      addition, each retail  dealer  shall,  within  twenty-four  hours  after
      receipt  of  any cigarettes at his or her place of business and prior to
      exposing for sale or sale by such retail dealer of such cigarettes, open
      such box, carton or other container and, unless such  stamps  have  been
      previously  affixed,  immediately  notify the dealer from whom he or she
      purchased such cigarettes and arrange for the replacement by the  dealer
      of  such  cigarettes  by  cigarettes  with  such  stamps  affixed within
      twenty-four hours.
        c. Stamps shall be cancelled in the manner prescribed by regulation.
        d. Whenever any cigarettes are found in the place  of  business  of  a
      dealer without the stamps affixed and cancelled, or not marked as having
      been  received  within  the preceding twenty-four hours, the prima facie
      presumption shall  arise  that  such  cigarettes  are  kept  therein  in
      violation of the provisions of this chapter.
        e.  Stamps  shall  be  affixed  to  each  package  of cigarettes of an
      aggregate denomination not less than the amount  of  the  tax  upon  the
      contents  therein,  and shall be affixed in such manner as to be visible
      to the purchaser.

      delivery tickets shall show the true name and address of  the  consignor
      or  seller,  the true name and address of the consignee or purchaser and
      the quantity and brands of the cigarettes transported.  The  absence  of

      provisions of this chapter.

      such  dealer,  the  date thereof, and the name of the shipper, and shall

      inspection of the commissioner of finance.
        b. The commissioner of finance by regulation may provide that whenever
      cigarettes  are  shipped  into  the  city, the railroad company, express

      cigarettes taxable under this chapter. To verify the accuracy of the tax
      imposed  and  assessed  by  this  chapter,  each  such  person is hereby
      directed and required to give to the  commissioner  of  finance  or  the
      commissioner's  duly  authorized  representatives, the means, facilities
      and opportunity for such examinations as are  herein  provided  for  and
      required.
        e.  The  commissioner  of finance shall investigate any failure to pay
      the tax required by this chapter or any other  failure  to  comply  with

      insufficient  and  the  maker  fails  to  file a corrected or sufficient
      return within ten days after the same may be required by notice from the
      commissioner of finance, he or she shall determine the amount of tax due
      from such information as may be obtainable or on the basis  of  external

      volume of sales by similar dealers and/or other factors. Notice of  such
      determination shall be given to the person liable for the payment of the
      tax. Such determination shall finally and irrevocably fix the tax unless

      conference  in accordance therewith, within ninety days from the mailing

      banc from the decision rendered in such hearing shall  be  conducted  in
      the manner and subject to the requirements prescribed by the tax appeals
      tribunal  pursuant  to  sections  one  hundred  sixty-eight  through one
      hundred seventy-two of this charter. After such hearing the tax  appeals
      tribunal  shall give notice of its decision to the person liable for the

      commissioner  of  finance  shall  refund,  without  interest,  any  tax,
      interest   or   penalty  erroneously,  illegally  or  unconstitutionally
      collected or paid. In  addition,  whenever  any  cigarettes  upon  which
      stamps  have been affixed have been sold and shipped to a dealer outside
      the city for sale there or to any person in another state for use there,
      or have become unfit for use and consumption or unsalable, or have  been
      destroyed, the dealer shall be entitled to a refund of the amount of tax
      paid,  less  the applicable commission, with respect to such cigarettes.
      In any event no refund  shall  be  granted  unless  application  to  the
      commissioner  of  finance  therefor  is  made within two years after the
      stamps were affixed to such cigarettes or the tax was paid, except if  a
      person  has  consented  in  writing  to  an  extension of the period for
      assessment of additional  tax  pursuant  to  subdivision  c  of  section
      11-1315  of  this chapter, and such consent is given within the two-year
      period for making a refund application provided in this subdivision, the
      period for making a refund application shall not  expire  prior  to  six
      months  after  the  expiration  of the period within which an assessment
      could be made  pursuant  to  such  consent  or  any  extension  thereof.
      Whenever  a refund is made or denied by the commissioner of finance, the
      commissioner shall state his or her reasons  therefor  and  give  notice
      thereof to the applicant in writing. A person shall not be entitled to a
      hearing  in connection with such application for a refund if such person
      has already had a hearing or had been given the opportunity of a hearing
      as provided in section 11-1310 of this chapter or has  failed  to  avail
      himself  or herself of the remedies therein provided. No refund shall be
      made of a tax, interest or penalty paid pursuant to a  determination  of
      the  commissioner  of  finance  as  provided  in section 11-1310 of this
      chapter, unless the tax appeals tribunal, after a  hearing  as  in  said
      section  provided  or  the  commissioner  of  finance, of his or her own
      motion, shall have reduced the tax or penalty, or  it  shall  have  been
      established  in  a  proceeding, pursuant to article seventy-eight of the
      civil practice law and rules  that  such  determination  was  erroneous,
      illegal, unconstitutional or otherwise improper, in which event a refund
      without  interest  shall  be  made as provided upon the determination of
      such proceeding.  Any  determination  of  the  commissioner  of  finance
      denying  a  refund  pursuant  to  this  subdivision  shall  be final and
      irrevocable unless the applicant for such  refund,  within  ninety  days
      from   the   mailing  of  notice  of  such  determination,  or,  if  the
      commissioner  of  finance  has  established  a  conciliation   procedure
      pursuant to section 11-124 of this title and the applicant has requested
      a  conciliation  conference  in accordance therewith, within ninety days
      from the  mailing  of  a  conciliation  decision  or  the  date  of  the
      commissioner's  confirmation  of  the discontinuance of the conciliation
      proceeding, both (1) serves a petition upon the commissioner of  finance
      and  (2)  files  a petition with the tax appeals tribunal for a hearing.
      Such petition for a refund made as provided in this subdivision shall be
      deemed an application for a revision of any  tax,  penalty  or  interest
      complained  of.  Such hearing and any appeal to the tax appeals tribunal
      sitting en banc from the decision rendered  in  such  hearing  shall  be
      conducted  in  the  manner and subject to the requirements prescribed by
      the tax appeals tribunal pursuant to sections  one  hundred  sixty-eight
      through  one hundred seventy-two of the charter. After such hearing, the
      tax appeals tribunal shall give notice of its decision to the  applicant
      and  to  the commissioner of finance. The applicant shall be entitled to
      maintain a proceeding under article seventy-eight of the civil  practice
      law  and  rules to review a decision of the tax appeals tribunal sitting
      en banc, provided, however, that such proceeding  is  instituted  within
    
      four  months  after such decision, and provided, further, in the case of
      an  application  by  a  person  liable  for  the  tax,  that   a   final
      determination   of  tax  due  was  not  previously  made,  and  that  an
      undertaking shall first be filed by such person with the commissioner of
      finance  in  such  amount  and  with  such  sureties as a justice of the
      supreme court shall approve, to the effect that if  such  proceeding  be
      dismissed  or  the  tax  confirmed  such  person  will pay all costs and
      charges which may accrue in the prosecution of such proceeding.
        b. If the commissioner of finance is  satisfied  that  any  dealer  is
      entitled  to a refund the commissioner shall issue to such dealer stamps
      of sufficient value to cover the refund or to make such refund.

Section 11-1314 ::    
        
     
        ยง  11-1314  Proceedings  to  recover tax. a. Whenever any person shall
      fail to pay any tax, penalty or interest  imposed  by  this  chapter  as
      herein  provided, the corporation counsel shall, upon the request of the
      commissioner of finance, bring or cause  to  be  brought  an  action  to
      enforce  the  payment  of the same on behalf of the city in any court of
      the state of New York or of any other state or of the United States. If,
      however, the commissioner of finance in his or her  discretion  believes
      that  a  taxpayer  subject to the provisions of this chapter is about to
      cease business, leave the state or remove or dissipate the assets out of
      which the tax, interest or penalties might be  satisfied  and  that  any
      such  tax,  interest or penalty will not be paid when due, he or she may
      declare such tax, interest or penalty to be immediately due and  payable
      and may issue a warrant immediately.
        b.  In addition to all other remedies for the collection of any taxes,
      penalties or interest due under the  provisions  of  this  chapter,  the
      commissioner  of  finance  may  issue  a  warrant,  directed to the city
      sheriff commanding the sheriff to  levy  upon  and  sell  the  real  and
      personal  property  of  the person liable for the tax which may be found
      within the city, for  the  payment  of  the  amount  thereof,  with  any
      penalties  and  interest  and  the cost of executing the warrant, and to
      return such warrant to the commissioner of finance and  to  pay  to  the
      commissioner  the  money  collected  by virtue thereof within sixty days
      after the receipt of such warrant. The city sheriff  shall  within  five
      days  after the receipt of the warrant file with the county clerk a copy
      thereof, and thereupon such clerk shall enter in the judgment docket the
      name of the person mentioned in the warrant and the amount of the taxes,
      penalty and interest for which the warrant is issued and the  date  when
      such  copy is filed. Thereupon the amount of such warrant shall become a
      lien upon the title to and interest in real and personal property of the
      person against whom the warrant is issued. The city sheriff  shall  then
      proceed upon the warrant in the same manner and with like effect as that
      provided  by  law  in respect to executions issued against property upon
      judgments of a court of  record,  and  for  services  in  executing  the
      warrant  the city sheriff shall be entitled to the same fees which he or
      she  may  collect  in  the  same  manner.  In  the  discretion  of   the
      commissioner of finance a warrant of like terms, force and effect may be
      issued  and  directed  to  any  officer or employee of the department of
      finance, and in the execution thereof such  officer  or  employee  shall
      have  all  the  powers  conferred  by  law  upon  sheriffs, but shall be
      entitled to no fee or compensation in excess of the actual expenses paid
      in the performance of such duty. If a warrant is returned not  satisfied
      in  full,  the  commissioner  of finance may from time to time issue new
      warrants and shall have the same remedies  to  enforce  the  amount  due
      thereunder  as if the city had recovered judgment therefor and execution
      thereon had been returned unsatisfied.
        c. The commissioner of finance, if he or she finds that the  interests
      of the city will not thereby be jeopardized, and upon such conditions as
      the  commissioner  of finance may require, may release any property from
      the lien of any  warrant  or  vacate  such  warrant  for  unpaid  taxes,
      additions to tax, penalties and interest filed pursuant to subdivision b
      of  this  section,  and  such  release or vacating of the warrant may be
      recorded in the office of any recording officer in  which  such  warrant
      has been filed. The clerk shall thereupon cancel and discharge as of the
      original date of docketing the vacated warrant.

      addressed  to  such person at the address given in the last return filed

      application  made  by  such  person  or,  if no return has been filed or
      application made, then to such address as may be obtainable. The mailing
      of such notice shall be presumptive evidence of the receipt of the  same
      by  the person to whom addressed. Any period of time which is determined
      according to the provisions of this chapter  by  the  giving  of  notice
      shall commence to run from the date of mailing of such notice.
        b. The provisions of the civil practice law and rules or any other law
      relative  to  limitations  of time for the enforcement of a civil remedy
      shall not apply to any proceeding or action taken by the city  to  levy,
      appraise,  assess,  determine  or  enforce  the  collection  of any tax,
      interest or penalty provided by this chapter.  However,  except  in  the
      case  of  a wilfully false or fraudulent return with intent to evade the
      tax, no assessment of additional tax shall be made after the  expiration
      of  more  than  three  years  from  the  date of the filing of a return,
      provided, that where no return has been filed as provided by law the tax
      may be assessed at any time.
        c. Where, before the expiration of the period  prescribed  herein  for
      the  assessment  of an additional tax, a person has consented in writing
      that such period be extended, the amount of such additional tax due  may
      be  determined  at  any  time within such extended period. The period so
      extended may be further extended by subsequent consents in writing  made
      before the expiration of the extended period.
        d.  If  any  return,  claim,  statement, notice, application, or other
      document required to be filed, or  any  payment  required  to  be  made,
      within  a  prescribed  period  or  on  or before a prescribed date under
      authority of any provision of this chapter is, after such period or such
      date, delivered by United States mail to the  commissioner  of  finance,
      the  tax  appeals tribunal, bureau, office, officer or person with which
      or with whom such document is required to be filed, or to  which  or  to
      whom  such payment is required to be made, the date of the United States
      postmark stamped on the envelope shall be  deemed  to  be  the  date  of
      delivery.  This  subdivision shall apply only if the postmark date falls
      within the prescribed period or on or before the prescribed date for the
      filing of such document,  or  for  making  the  payment,  including  any
      extension  granted for such filing or payment, and only if such document
      or  payment  was  deposited  in  the  mail,  postage  prepaid,  properly
      addressed  to  the  commissioner  of  finance, the tax appeals tribunal,
      bureau, office, officer or person with which or with whom  the  document
      is  required to be filed or to which or to whom such payment is required
      to be made. If any document is sent by United  States  registered  mail,
      such  registration  shall be prima facie evidence that such document was
      delivered to the commissioner of  finance,  the  tax  appeals  tribunal,
      bureau, office, officer or person to which or to whom addressed, and the
      date of registration shall be deemed the postmark date. The commissioner
      of finance or, where relevant, the tax appeals tribunal is authorized to
      provide  by  regulation  the  extent  to  which  the  provisions  of the
      preceding sentence with respect to prima facie evidence of delivery  and
      the  postmark  date shall apply to certified mail. Except as provided in
      subdivision f of this section, this subdivision shall apply in the  case
      of postmarks not made by the United States postal service only if and to
      the  extent  provided  by  regulation of the commissioner of finance or,
      where relevant, the tax appeals tribunal.
    
        e. When the last  day  prescribed  under  authority  of  this  chapter
      (including  any  extension  of  time)  for performing any act falls on a
      Saturday, Sunday or legal holiday in the state, the performance of  such
      act shall be considered timely if it is performed on the next succeeding
      day which is not a Saturday, Sunday or legal holiday.
        f.  (1)  Any  reference in subdivision d of this section to the United
      States mail shall be treated as including a reference  to  any  delivery
      service designated by the secretary of the treasury of the United States
      pursuant  to  section  seventy-five  hundred two of the internal revenue
      code and any reference in subdivision d of  this  section  to  a  United
      States  postmark  shall  be treated as including a reference to any date
      recorded or marked in  the  manner  described  in  section  seventy-five
      hundred  two  of  the  internal  revenue  code  by a designated delivery
      service. If the commissioner of finance finds that any delivery  service
      designated  by  such  secretary is inadequate for the needs of the city,
      the commissioner of finance may withdraw such designation  for  purposes
      of this title. The commissioner of finance may also designate additional
      delivery  services  meeting the criteria of section seventy-five hundred
      two of the internal revenue code for purposes  of  this  title,  or  may
      withdraw  any such designation if the commissioner of finance finds that
      a delivery service so designated is inadequate  for  the  needs  of  the
      city.  Any  reference  in  subdivision  d  of this section to the United
      States mail shall be treated as including a reference  to  any  delivery
      service  designated  by the commissioner of finance and any reference in
      subdivision d of this section to  a  United  States  postmark  shall  be
      treated  as  including a reference to any date recorded or marked in the
      manner described in section seventy-five hundred  two  of  the  internal
      revenue  code  by  a  delivery service designated by the commissioner of
      finance. Notwithstanding the foregoing, any withdrawal of designation or
      additional designation by the  commissioner  of  finance  shall  not  be
      effective  for purposes of service upon the tax appeals tribunal, unless
      and until such withdrawal of designation or  additional  designation  is
      ratified by the president of the tax appeals tribunal.
        (2)  Any  equivalent of registered or certified mail designated by the
      United States secretary of the treasury, or as may be designated by  the
      commissioner  of  finance  pursuant  to  the  same criteria used by such
      secretary for such designations pursuant to section seventy-five hundred
      two of the internal revenue code, shall be included within  the  meaning
      of  registered  or  certified  mail  as  used  in  subdivision d of this
      section. If the commissioner of finance finds  that  any  equivalent  of
      registered  or  certified  mail  designated  by  such  secretary  or the
      commissioner of finance is inadequate for the needs  of  the  city,  the
      commissioner  of  finance  may withdraw such designation for purposes of
      this title. Notwithstanding the foregoing, any withdrawal of designation
      or additional designation by the commissioner of finance  shall  not  be
      effective  for purposes of service upon the tax appeals tribunal, unless
      and until such withdrawal of designation or  additional  designation  is
      ratified by the president of the tax appeals tribunal.

      payable under this chapter when due shall be subject  to  a  penalty  of
      fifty  per  centum  of  the  amount  of tax due, but the commissioner of
      finance, if satisfied that the delay was excusable, may remit all or any
      part of such penalty. Such penalty shall be paid and disposed of in  the
      same  manner  as other revenues under this chapter. Unpaid penalties may
      be enforced in the same manner as the tax imposed by this chapter.
        b. (1) In addition to any other penalty imposed by this  section,  the
      commissioner  of  finance  may (a) impose a penalty of not more than one
      hundred dollars for each two hundred cigarettes or fraction  thereof  in
      excess  of  one  thousand  cigarettes in unstamped or unlawfully stamped
      packages in the possession or under the control of any  person  and  (b)
      impose  a  penalty  of  not  more  than two hundred dollars for each ten
      affixed or unaffixed false, altered or counterfeit cigarette tax stamps,
      imprints or impressions, or fraction thereof, in excess of  one  hundred
      affixed or unaffixed false, altered or counterfeit cigarette tax stamps,
      imprints  or  impressions  in the possession or under the control of any
      person. Such penalty shall be determined as provided in section  11-1310
      of this chapter, and may be reviewed only pursuant to such section. Such
      penalty  may  be  enforced in the same manner as the tax imposed by this
      chapter. The commissioner of finance, in  his  or  her  discretion,  may
      remit  all  or  part  of  such  penalty.  Such penalty shall be paid and
      disposed of in the same manner as other revenues under this chapter.
        (2) The penalties imposed by this paragraph  may  be  imposed  by  the
      commissioner of finance in addition to any other penalty imposed by this
      section,  but  in  lieu  of the penalties imposed by subparagraph (a) of
      paragraph one of this subdivision: (a) not less than thirty dollars  but
      not  more  than  two hundred dollars for each two hundred cigarettes, or
      fraction thereof, in excess of one thousand cigarettes but less than  or
      equal  to  five  thousand  cigarettes in unstamped or unlawfully stamped
      packages knowingly in the possession or knowingly under the  control  of
      any person; (b) not less than seventy-five dollars but not more than two
      hundred dollars for each two hundred cigarettes, or fraction thereof, in
      excess  of  five  thousand  cigarettes  but less than or equal to twenty
      thousand  cigarettes  in  unstamped  or  unlawfully   stamped   packages
      knowingly  in  the  possession  or  knowingly  under  the control of any
      person; and (c) not less than one hundred dollars but not more than  two
      hundred dollars for each two hundred cigarettes, or fraction thereof, in
      excess  of twenty thousand cigarettes in unstamped or unlawfully stamped
      packages, knowingly in the possession or knowingly under the control  of
      any  person.  Such  penalty  shall  be determined as provided in section
      11-1310 of this chapter, and may  be  reviewed  only  pursuant  to  such
      section.  Such  penalty  may  be  enforced in the same manner as the tax
      imposed by this chapter. The commissioner of  finance,  in  his  or  her
      discretion, may remit all or part of such penalty. Such penalty shall be
      paid  and  disposed  of  in the same manner as other revenues under this
      chapter.
        * c. (1) The possession within the city  of  more  than  four  hundred
      cigarettes   in  unstamped  or  unlawfully  stamped  packages  shall  be
      presumptive evidence that such cigarettes are subject to tax as provided
      by this chapter.
        (2) Nothing in this section shall apply to common or contract carriers
      or warehousemen  while  engaged  in  lawfully  transporting  or  storing
      unstamped  packages of cigarettes as merchandise, nor to any employee of
      such carrier or warehouseman acting within  the  scope  of  his  or  her
      employment,  nor  to  public officers or employees in the performance of
      their official duties requiring possession or control  of  unstamped  or
      unlawfully  stamped  packages of cigarettes, nor to temporary incidental
    
      possession by employees  or  agents  of  persons  lawfully  entitled  to
      possession, nor to persons whose possession is for the purpose of aiding
      police officers in performing their duties.

        d.  (1)  If  any  amount of tax is not paid on or before the last date
      prescribed for payment (without regard to any extension of time  granted
      for   payment),  interest  on  such  amount  at  the  rate  set  by  the
      commissioner of finance pursuant to paragraph two of  this  subdivision,
      or,  if  no  rate  is set, at the rate of seven and one-half percent per
      annum, shall be paid for the period from such last date to the  date  of
      payment.  In  computing the amount of interest to be paid, such interest
      shall be compounded daily. Interest under this subdivision shall not  be
      paid if the amount thereof is less than one dollar. The interest imposed
      by  this subdivision shall be paid and disposed of in the same manner as
      other revenues from this chapter. Unpaid interest may be enforced in the
      same manner as the tax imposed by this chapter.
        (2) (A) The commissioner of finance shall set the rate of interest  to
      be  paid  pursuant  to paragraph one of this subdivision, but if no such
      rate of interest is set, such rate shall be deemed to be  set  at  seven
      and  one-half  percent per annum. Such rate shall be the rate prescribed
      in subparagraph (B) of this paragraph but shall not be less  than  seven
      and one-half percent per annum. Any such rate set by the commissioner of
      finance  shall  apply  to taxes, or any portion thereof, which remain or
      become due on or after the date on which such rate becomes effective and
      shall apply only with respect to interest  computed  or  computable  for
      periods  or  portions  of  periods occurring in the period in which such
      rate is in effect.
        (B) General rule. The rate of  interest  set  under  this  subdivision
      shall  be  the  sum of (i) the federal short-term rate as provided under
      paragraph three of this subdivision, plus (ii) seven percentage points.
        (3) Federal short-term rate. For purposes of this subdivision:
        (A) The federal short-term rate for any month  shall  be  the  federal
      short-term  rate  determined  by  the  United  States  secretary  of the
      treasury during such month in accordance with subsection (d) of  section
      twelve  hundred  seventy-four  of  the  internal revenue code for use in
      connection with section six  thousand  six  hundred  twenty-one  of  the
      internal  revenue  code.  Any  such rate shall be rounded to the nearest
      full percent (or, if a multiple of one-half of one  percent,  such  rate
      shall be increased to the next highest full percent).
        (B) Period during which rate applies.
        (i)   In   general.   Except  as  provided  in  clause  (ii)  of  this
      subparagraph, the federal short-term rate for the first  month  in  each
      calendar quarter shall apply during the first calendar quarter beginning
      after such month.
        (ii)  Special  rule  for  the  month  of  September,  nineteen hundred
      eighty-nine. The  federal  short-term  rate  for  the  month  of  April,
      nineteen  hundred  eighty-nine  shall  apply with respect to setting the
      rate  of  interest  for  the  month  of  September,   nineteen   hundred
      eighty-nine.
        (4)  Publication  of  interest rate. The commissioner of finance shall
      cause to be published in the city record,  and  give  other  appropriate
      general notice of, the interest rate to be set under this subdivision no
      later  than  twenty days preceding the first day of the calendar quarter
      during which such interest rate applies. The setting and publication  of
      such  interest  rate  shall  not  be  included  within  paragraph (a) of
      subdivision five of section one thousand forty-one of the  city  charter
      relating to the definition of a rule.
