      and  all sewer rents, sewer surcharges and water rents, and the interest
      and charges thereon, which may be laid or may have heretofore been laid,
      upon any real estate now in the city, shall continue to be, until  paid,
      a  lien thereon, and shall be preferred in payment to all other charges.

      connections, setting, repair or maintenance shall not be due or become a

      against which a charge shall be made, until such charge shall have  been
      definitely fixed by the commissioner of environmental protection, and an
      entry  of  the amount thereof shall have been made with the date of such
      entry in the book in which the  charges  for  water  supplied  by  meter
      against  such  premises  are  to be entered. A charge in accordance with
      meter rates or minimum charges for  the  supply  of  water  measured  by
      meter,  and a service charge shall not be due or become a lien or charge
      upon the premises where such meter is installed  until  an  entry  shall
      have  been made indicating that such premises are metered, with the date
      of such entry in the book in  which  the  charges  for  water  by  meter
      measurement  against  such  premises are to be entered. The words "sewer
      rents" when used in this chapter shall mean any rents or charges imposed
      pursuant to section 24-514 of the code or pursuant to the New York  city
      municipal water finance authority act, which is set forth in title two-A
      of  article  five  of  the  public  authorities  law.  The  words "sewer
      surcharges" when used in this chapter shall  mean  the  charges  imposed
      pursuant  to section 24-523 of the code or pursuant to the New York city
      municipal water finance authority act, which is set forth in title two-A
      of article five of the public authorities law. Whenever an  increase  in
      the  amount  of uniform annual charges or extra or miscellaneous charges
      shall have been made or a charge shall have been made for water services
      for any building completed subsequent to the first  day  of  January  in
      each  year,  the amount of such increase of the charge or new charge for
      such new building shall not be due or become a lien  or  charge  against
      the  premises until the amounts thereof shall have been entered with the
      date of such entries, respectively, in the books in  which  the  uniform
      annual  charges and extra or miscellaneous charges against such premises
      are to be entered. The words "tax lien" when used in this chapter  shall
      mean  the  lien  arising  pursuant  to the provisions of this chapter or
      pursuant to the New York city municipal  water  finance  authority  act,
      which  is  set  forth  in  title  two-A  of  article  five of the public
      authorities law, as a result of the nonpayment  of  taxes,  assessments,
      sewer  rents,  sewer surcharges, water rents, any other charges that are
      made a lien subject to the provisions of this chapter, the costs of  any
      advertisements  and  notices  given  pursuant to this chapter, any other
      charges that are due and payable, a surcharge pursuant to section 11-332
      of this chapter if the tax lien is sold, interest and penalties  thereon
      and  the  right of the city to receive such amounts. The words "tax lien
      certificate" when  used  in  this  chapter  shall  mean  the  instrument
      evidencing a tax lien and executed by the commissioner of finance or his
    
      or  her designee at such time as such lien is transferred to a purchaser

        § 11-306 Interest to be charged if assessments unpaid for ninety days;
      payment  in  installments. If any assessment shall remain unpaid for the
      period of ninety days after the date of the entry thereof on the  record
      of  titles  of  assessments, it shall be the duty of the commissioner of
      finance or his or her designee to charge, collect and  receive  interest
      thereon, at the rate of seven percent per annum, to be calculated to the
      date  of  payment  from  the  date when such assessment became a lien as
      provided by section three hundred fourteen of the charter  in  force  at
      the  time  of the adoption of the New York city charter by referendum in

      president  of  the tax commission, or any tax commissioner duly assigned
      by him or her, shall forthwith certify the same to the  commissioner  of

Section 11-307
--------------

Section 11-307 ::    
        
     
        §  11-307  Payments  in  installments  of  assessments  heretofore  or
      hereafter confirmed. Upon the application in writing of the owner  of  a
      parcel  of  real property affected by an unpaid assessment heretofore or
      hereafter confirmed the amount of which is one hundred dollars or  more,
      the commissioner of finance shall divide the assessment upon such parcel
      into  fifteen parts or, if the application so requests, into five parts,
      as nearly equal as may be, or if the amount of such assessment is  fifty
      dollars  or  more  but less than one hundred dollars the commissioner of
      finance shall divide the assessment upon such parcel into five parts  as
      nearly  equal  as may be. One part thereof in any event shall be due and
      payable, and in each case as many more of such parts shall  be  due  and
      payable  as  years  may  have  elapsed  since the entry of such original
      assessment for collection. Such parts thereof with interest at the  rate
      of  seven percent per annum on the amount of the assessment unpaid shall
      be paid at the time of application as a condition of  the  extension  of
      time  of  payment  of  the  remainder  as provided in this section. Upon
      payment of such parts and interests, the  balance  of  such  assessments
      shall  cease  to be a lien upon such real property except as hereinafter
      provided; and the remaining parts shall be paid in  annual  installments
      as herein provided. Of such installments the first, with interest at the
      rate  of  four  percent  thereon,  and on the installments thereafter to
      become due, from the date of payment of the  parts  of  such  assessment
      paid  as  hereinbefore  provided,  shall become due and payable and be a
      lien on the real property assessed, on the next ensuing  anniversary  of
      the  date  of  entry  of  the  assessment  in  the  record  of titles of
      assessments confirmed; and one,  with  interest  at  the  rate  of  four
      percent  per  annum thereon and on the installments thereafter to become
      due shall become due and payable and be a lien upon  the  real  property
      assessed,  annually  thereafter.  After  the  time  herein specified for
      annual installments and interest to become due, the amount of  the  lien
      thereon  shall bear interest at the rate of seven percent per annum. Any
      installment assessment shall not be further divided  into  installments.
      The  first  installment  of  an assessment divided within the ninety-day
      period  provided  by  section  11-306  of  this  chapter  during   which
      assessment  may  be  paid  without  interest  shall  not  be  subject to
      interest, but the second installment with interest at the rate  of  four
      percent  per  annum from the original date of entry shall become due and
      payable and be a lien upon the real property on the anniversary date  of
      entry  of  the  assessment  and the remaining installments with interest
      shall become due and payable and be a  lien  on  the  real  property  as
      hereinbefore  provided.  The  installments  not due with interest at the
      rate of four percent per annum to the date of payment may be paid at any
      time. The provisions of this chapter with reference to the sale  of  tax
      liens  shall  apply  to the several unpaid installments and the interest
      thereon in the same manner as  if  each  installment  and  the  interest
      thereon had been imposed as an assessment payable in one payment, at the
      time  such installment became a lien. In the event of the acquisition by
      condemnation by the city for public purposes  any  property  upon  which
      there are installments not due, such installments shall become due as of
      the  date  of  the  entry of the final order of the supreme court or the
      confirmation of the report of  the  commissioners  in  the  condemnation
      proceedings,  and shall be set off against an award that may be made for
      the property acquired.
        When an award for damage shall accrue to the same person who is or was
      at the time the assessment was confirmed liable for the assessments  for
      benefit  on  the  abutting  property  in  the same proceedings, only the
      portion of the assessment in excess of such award may be  considered  in
      levying  in installments under the provisions of this section. Except as
    
      provided in this section, no such annual installment shall be a lien  or
      deemed to be an encumbrance upon the title to the real property assessed
      until it becomes due as herein provided.
    
    
    
    
    
    
    

Section 11-308
--------------

Section 11-308 ::    
        
     
        §  11-308  Apportionment of assessment. If a sum of money in gross has
      been or shall be assessed upon any lands or premises in  the  city,  any
      person or persons claiming any divided or undivided part thereof may pay
      such  part  of  the  sums of money so assessed, also of the interest and
      charges due or charged thereon, as the commissioner of finance may  deem
      to be just and equitable. The remainder of the sum of money so assessed,
      together with the interest and charges, shall be a lien upon the residue
      of the land and premises only, and the tax lien upon such residue may be
      sold  in  pursuance  of  the  provisions of this chapter, to satisfy the
      residue of such assessment, interest, or charges thereon,  in  the  same
      manner  as  though  the residue of such assessment had been imposed upon
      such residue of such land or premises.

      piece or parcel of land in the city of New York or any person interested
      in such lot, piece or parcel, may file with the department of finance, a
      statement containing a brief description of such land, together with the
      section, block  and  lot  number  thereof,  or  such  other  identifying
      information  as at the time is established by the department of finance,
      and a statement of the applicant's interest  therein,  together  with  a
      written  request that such lot, piece or parcel of land be registered in
      the name of  the  applicant.  In  such  statement  the  applicant  shall
      designate a post office address to which notifications addressed to such
      applicant  shall  be  sent.  A  brief  description of such lot, piece or
      parcel of land corresponding to the description thereof in the statement
      so filed, together with the name of the applicant and his  or  her  post
      office  address  and  the  date  of such application, shall thereupon be
      registered in the department of finance.
        b. As soon as any assessment for a local improvement shall  have  been
      confirmed, including assessments confirmed by a court of record, and the
      list  thereof  shall  have  been  entered and filed in the department of
      finance, such assessment list shall be examined  and  thereupon,  within
      twenty days after such entry there shall be mailed a notice addressed to
      each  person in whose name any lot, piece or parcel of land, affected by
      such assessment, is registered, at the post office address registered in
      the records of the department of finance, which notice shall contain the
      brief description of the lot, piece or parcel of land registered in  the
      name  of  the person to whom such notice is addressed, together with the
      amount assessed thereon, date of entry, and title of the improvement for
      which such assessment is made, and a statement of the rate  of  interest
      or  penalty  imposed for the nonpayment of such assessment, and the date
      from which the interest or penalty will be computed. Failure  to  comply
      with  the  provisions  herein,  however,  shall  in no manner affect the
      validity or collectibility of any  assessment  heretofore  or  hereafter
      confirmed,  nor  shall any claim arise or exist against the comptroller,
      the commissioner of finance, or any officer of the  city  by  reason  of
      such failure.
        c.  The  commissioner  of finance or his or her designee shall for the
      purpose of this section provide appropriate records for each section  of
      the  city,  included  within  the respective boroughs, as the same shall
      appear upon the tax maps of the city.

      annum  from  the  date  of entry to the date of payment. The sewer rents
      charged against unmetered premises for  the  use  of  the  sewer  system
      during  the  one-year period commencing on the first day of July of each

      given pursuant to this chapter, any  other  charges  that  are  due  and
      payable,  a  surcharge  pursuant  to section 11-332 of this chapter, and
      interest and penalties thereon or such component of the  amount  thereof
      as  shall be determined by the commissioner of finance. The commissioner
      of finance may promulgate rules defining "abandoned" property,  as  such
      term is used in this subdivision.

      For purposes of this subdivision, the words "real  property  tax"  shall
      not  include  an  assessment or charge upon property imposed pursuant to
      section 25-411 of the administrative code. Nothing in  this  subdivision
      shall  be deemed to limit the rights conferred by section 11-332 of this

      chapter on the holder of a  tax  lien  certificate  with  respect  to  a
      subsequent tax lien.
        b.  The  commissioner  of finance, on behalf of the city, may sell tax
      liens, either  individually,  in  combinations,  or  in  the  aggregate,
      pursuant  to the procedures provided herein. The commissioner of finance
      shall establish the terms and conditions of a sale of a tax lien or  tax
      liens.  Enactment  of  the  local  law that added this sentence shall be
      deemed to constitute authorization by the council for  the  commissioner
      of finance to conduct a sale or sales of tax liens through and including
      December  thirty-first,  two  thousand  fourteen. Subsequent to December
      thirty-first, two  thousand  fourteen,  the  city  shall  not  have  the
      authority to sell tax liens.
        1. (i) The commissioner of finance may, in his or her discretion, sell
      a  tax  lien or tax liens through a competitive sale. In addition to the
      advertisement and notice required to be  provided  pursuant  to  section
      11-320  of  this  chapter,  the  commissioner  of  finance or his or her
      designee shall cause to be published a notice of intention to sell a tax
      lien or tax liens through a competitive sale, which notice shall include
      the terms and conditions for such sale, the criteria by which bids shall
      be evaluated, and a request for any other information or documents  that
      the  commissioner of finance may require. Such notice shall be published
      in one newspaper of general circulation  in  the  city,  not  less  than
      fifteen  days  prior  to the date designated by the commissioner for the
      submission of bids.
        (ii) The commissioner of  finance  may,  in  his  or  her  discretion,
      establish  criteria  for  the eligibility of bidders pursuant to section
      11-321.1 of this chapter.
        (iii) The commissioner of finance may reject any or all bids,  or  may
      accept any combination of bids in a competitive sale.
        2. (i) The commissioner of finance may, in his or her discretion, sell
      a  tax  lien  or tax liens through a negotiated sale. In addition to the
      advertisement and notice required to be  provided  pursuant  to  section
      11-320  of  this  chapter,  the  commissioner  of  finance or his or her
      designee shall cause to be published a notice of intention to sell a tax
      lien or tax liens through a negotiated sale, which notice  shall  advise
      that  a request for statements of interest is available at the office of
      the department of finance, and which may require the submission  of  any
      information  or  documents  that  the  commissioner  deems  appropriate,
      provided, however, that if the negotiated sale is to a  trust  or  other
      entity  created  by  the  city  or in which the city has an ownership or
      residual interest, then the requirement that the notice  advise  that  a
      request  for  statements  of  interest is available at the office of the
      department of finance shall not apply. Such notice shall be published in
    
      one newspaper of general circulation in the city, not less than  fifteen
      days prior to the date designated by the commissioner for the receipt of
      statements  of  interest,  or if the negotiated sale is to such trust or
      other  entity, then such notice shall be published not less than fifteen
      days prior to the date of sale. For purposes of this  subparagraph,  the
      words "date of sale" shall have the same meaning provided in subdivision
      e of section 11-320 of this chapter.
        (ii)  The  commissioner  of finance may engage in a negotiated sale in
      accordance with criteria to be established pursuant to section  11-321.1
      of this chapter.
        (iii)  The  commissioner  of  finance  may execute a purchase and sale
      agreement and other necessary agreements with a designated purchaser  or
      purchasers to complete a negotiated sale.
        3.  The  commissioner of finance may establish a minimum price for the
      sale of tax liens that may be at a discount from or premium to the  lien
      amount.  Notwithstanding  the  preceding  sentence,  the commissioner of
      finance may not establish a minimum price for the sale of an  individual
      tax lien that is at a discount from the lien amount. The commissioner of
      finance  shall  sell  such  tax  liens  at a purchase price that, in the
      determination of such commissioner, is in  the  best  interests  of  the
      city.  The commissioner of finance, in his or her discretion, may accept
      cash or  cash  equivalent  in  immediately  available  funds,  or  other
      consideration acceptable to the commissioner, or any combination thereof
      in payment for a tax lien or tax liens.
        4.  The  amount  of  a  tax lien that is sold pursuant to this chapter
      shall be the unpaid amount of the lien as of the date of sale, including
      any interest and penalties thereon, any taxes, assessments, sewer rents,
      sewer surcharges, water rents, any other charges that are  made  a  lien
      subject   to   the   provisions  of  this  chapter,  the  costs  of  any
      advertisements and notices given pursuant to  this  chapter,  any  other
      charges  that  are  due  and  payable, any surcharge pursuant to section
      11-332 of this chapter, and interest  and  penalties  thereon,  or  such
      component   of  the  amount  thereof  as  shall  be  determined  by  the
      commissioner of finance, notwithstanding the amount paid for purchase of
      the tax lien or component of the amount thereof. For  purposes  of  this
      paragraph,  the  words,  "date  of  sale"  shall  have  the same meaning
      provided in section 11-320(e) of this chapter.
        5. (i) The commissioner of finance may, subsequent to  the  offer  for
      sale of any tax lien or tax liens and the failure to complete such sale,
      offer  such  tax lien or tax liens for sale again to any other person or
      persons who satisfied the terms  and  conditions  of  the  sale  without
      providing  any  additional  advertisements  or  notices pursuant to this
      chapter.
        (ii) Notwithstanding subparagraph (i) of this paragraph, any tax  lien
      that  was noticed for sale pursuant to this chapter, but was not sold on
      the  original  date  of  sale,  may  be  sold  without  any   additional
      advertisements  or  notices  pursuant  to this chapter if the subsequent
      date of sale is within six months of the second publication, pursuant to
      subdivision a of section 11-320 of this chapter, of the  notice  of  the
      original  date  of sale. If the subsequent date of sale is more than six
      months after the  second  publication,  pursuant  to  subdivision  a  of
      section  11-320  of  this chapter, of the notice of the original date of
      sale, then the commissioner of finance, or his or  her  designee,  shall
      provide  notice of the subsequent date of sale pursuant to subdivision b
      of section 11-320 of this chapter. No other additional advertisements or
      notices shall be necessary prior to the date of sale.
        6. The rate of interest on any tax lien certificate shall be the  rate
      adopted for nonpayment of taxes on real property pursuant to subdivision
    
      (e) of section 11-224.1 of this title on the effective date of the local
      law that added this sentence.
        7. It is the intent of the city that a sale of a tax lien or tax liens
      pursuant to this chapter shall be a sale and not a borrowing.
        8.  Whenever  any tax lien purchased at a tax lien sale is found to be
      invalid, void or defective in whole or in part, or not to conform to any
      representation  or  warranty  with  respect   thereto,   made   by   the
      commissioner of finance in connection with the sale thereof, by judgment
      or  decree  of  a court of competent jurisdiction or by determination of
      the commissioner of finance, the commissioner of finance may, in his  or
      her  discretion, substitute for such tax lien or portion thereof another
      tax lien that has a value equivalent to the value of  the  tax  lien  or
      portion  thereof  found  to  be  invalid,  void, defective, or not to so
      conform, or may refund such value of the tax  lien  or  portion  thereof
      found to be invalid, void, defective, or not to so conform, or may use a
      combination  of  substitution  and  refund.  No  other  remedy  shall be
      available to a purchaser of a tax lien which is  found  to  be  invalid,
      void,  defective, or not to conform to a representation or warranty with
      respect thereto made by the commissioner of finance in  connection  with
      the  sale  thereof,  in  whole  or  in part. Whenever a tax lien of such
      equivalent value is to be substituted for a tax lien that has been found
      invalid, void, defective, or not to so conform, in  whole  or  in  part,
      pursuant  to  this  section,  the  commissioner of finance or his or her
      designee shall provide mailed notice of the intention to substitute such
      lien of such equivalent value to any  person  required  to  be  notified
      pursuant to section 11-320(b) of this chapter.
        9.  The  commissioner  of  finance  may  establish  requirements for a
      purchaser of a tax lien to provide any information  and  documents  that
      the  commissioner  of  finance  deems  necessary,  including information
      concerning the collection and enforcement of tax liens. The commissioner
      of finance shall require the purchaser of a  tax  lien  to  provide  the
      owner  of  property  on  which a tax lien has been sold pursuant to this
      chapter a detailed itemization of taxes, interest, surcharges, and  fees
      charged  to such owner on all tax lien statements of amounts due or bill
      of charges. Such fees shall be bona fide, reasonable and, in the case of
      attorney fees, customary.
        10. (i) Before January first, two thousand twelve, any tax lien or tax
      liens that are sold pursuant to this chapter  on  property  owned  by  a
      company  organized  pursuant  to article XI of the state private housing
      finance law shall be deemed defective. On and after January  first,  two
      thousand  twelve,  any  tax  lien or tax liens that are sold pursuant to
      this chapter on any class two residential property owned  by  a  company
      organized  pursuant  to  article XI of the state private housing finance
      law that is a residential condominium or residential cooperative,  shall
      be  deemed defective. For the purposes of this paragraph, property owned
      by such company shall be limited to property owned for the  purpose,  as
      set  forth  in  section  five  hundred  seventy-one of the state private
      housing finance law, of providing housing for families  and  persons  of
      low income.
        (ii) No later than May first, two thousand eleven, the commissioner of
      finance,  in  consultation with the commissioner of housing preservation
      and development, shall notify by mail any class two residential property
      owned by a company organized pursuant to article XI of the state private
      housing finance law that is not a residential condominium or residential
      cooperative, of the authority of the commissioner of finance to sell the
      tax liens on such property. Such notification shall include  information
      relating  to  the  lien  sale  process,  including,  but not limited to,
      actions homeowners can take if a lien is sold on such property; the type
    
      of debt that can be sold  in  a  lien  sale;  a  timeline  of  statutory
      notifications  required  pursuant  to  section 11-320 of this chapter; a
      clear, concise explanation of the consequences of  the  sale  of  a  tax
      lien;  the  telephone number and electronic mail address of the employee
      or employees designated pursuant to subdivision f of section  11-320  of
      this chapter; a conspicuous statement that the owner of the property may
      enter  into  a  payment  plan  for exclusion from the tax lien sale; and
      credits and property tax exemptions that may exclude a property  from  a
      tax  lien  sale  and  any  other credit or residential real property tax
      exemption information, which, in the  discretion  of  the  commissioner,
      should be included in such notification.
        Upon  such  property owner's written request, or verbal request to 311
      or any employee designated pursuant to subdivision f of  section  11-320
      of  this  chapter,  a Chinese, Korean, Russian or Spanish translation of
      such notice shall be provided promptly to such property owner.
        11.  No  later  than  September  first,  two  thousand   eleven,   the
      appropriate  agency shall promulgate rules identifying or describing any
      existing procedures governing challenges to the  validity  of  any  real
      property  tax, sewer rent, sewer surcharge, water rent, emergency repair
      charge or alternative enforcement expense or fee.

Section 11-320 ::    
        
     
        §  11-320  Notice of sale to be advertised and mailed. a. The tax lien
      on property in the city shall not be sold pursuant to section 11-319  of
      this  chapter  unless  notice  of  such sale as provided herein has been
      published twice, the first publication to be in a newspaper  of  general
      circulation in the city, not less than ninety days preceding the date of
      the  sale,  and the second publication to be in a publication designated
      by the commissioner of finance, not less than  ten  days  preceding  the
      date  of the sale. Such publication shall include a description by block
      and lot or by such other identification as the commissioner  of  finance
      may  deem  appropriate,  of  the property upon which the tax lien exists
      that may be included in the sale, and a statement that a list of the tax
      liens that may be included in the sale is available  for  inspection  in
      the  office  of  the city register and the office of the county clerk of
      Richmond county. The commissioner of finance shall file such list in the
      office of the city register and  the  office  of  the  county  clerk  of
      Richmond county not less than ninety days prior to the date of sale.
        b. 1. A tax lien shall not be sold unless the commissioner of finance,
      or  his  or her designee, notifies the owner of record at the address of
      record and any other person  who  has  registered  pursuant  to  section
      11-309  of this chapter, or pursuant to section 11-416 or 11-417 of this
      title, by first class mail, of the intention to sell the tax lien. If no
      such registrations have been filed then such commissioner, or his or her
      designee, shall notify the  person  whose  name  and  address,  if  any,
      appears  in  the  latest  annual record of assessed valuations, by first
      class mail, of the intention to sell the tax lien.  Such  mailed  notice
      shall  include  a  description of the property by block and lot and such
      other identifying information as the commissioner of  finance  may  deem
      appropriate,   the   amount  of  the  tax  lien,  including  all  taxes,
      assessments, sewer rents,  sewer  surcharges,  water  rents,  any  other
      charges  that are made a lien subject to the provisions of this chapter,
      as well as an estimate of the costs of any  advertisements  and  notices
      given  pursuant  to  this  chapter,  any  other charges that are due and
      payable on the date specified in such publication, a surcharge  pursuant
      to  section 11-332 of this chapter if the tax lien is sold, and interest
      and penalties thereon, and shall be mailed to such owner and such  other
      persons  four  times:  not  less than ninety, sixty, thirty and ten days
      prior to the date of sale. Such  notice  shall  state  that  if  default
      continues to be made in payment of the amounts due on such property, the
      tax lien on such property shall be sold as provided in section 11-319 of
      this  chapter. If, notwithstanding such notice, the owner shall continue
      to refuse or neglect to pay  the  amounts  due  on  such  property,  the
      commissioner  of  finance  may  sell  the  tax  lien on such property as
      provided in section 11-319 of this chapter.
        2. (i) Such notices shall also include, with respect to  any  property
      owner in class one or class two, as such classes of property are defined
      in  subdivision one of section eighteen hundred two of the real property
      tax law, an exemption eligibility checklist. Within ten business days of
      receipt  of  a  completed  exemption  eligibility  checklist  from  such
      property  owner,  provided that such receipt occurs prior to the date of
      sale of any tax lien or tax liens on his or her property, the department
      of finance shall review  such  checklist  to  determine,  based  on  the
      information  provided by the property owner, whether such property owner
      could be eligible for any exemption, credit or other benefit that  would
      entitle  them to be excluded from a tax lien sale and, if the department
      determines that such property owner  could  be  eligible  for  any  such
      exemption,  credit  or  other benefit, shall mail such property owner an
      application for the appropriate exemption, credit or other benefit.  If,
      within  twenty  business  days  of  the  date the department mailed such
    
      application, the department has not  received  a  completed  application
      from  such property owner, the department shall mail such property owner
      a second application, and shall telephone the  property  owner,  if  the
      property owner has included his or her telephone number on the exemption
      eligibility checklist.
        (ii)  Any such property owner who returns to the department of finance
      a completed exemption eligibility checklist prior to the date of sale of
      any tax lien or tax liens on his or her property  and  who  subsequently
      submits a completed application for the appropriate exemption, credit or
      other  benefit either prior to, on or up to ninety days after such sale,
      shall have his or her application reviewed by the department of finance.
      If, prior to the date of sale, the department of finance determines that
      such property owner is qualified for such  exemption,  credit  or  other
      benefit  or  will be qualified as of the date of sale, then the tax lien
      or tax liens on his or her property shall not be sold on such date.  If,
      on  or after the date of sale, the department of finance determines that
      such property owner is or was qualified for such  exemption,  credit  or
      other  benefit as of the date of sale, then any tax lien or tax liens on
      his or her property that were sold shall be deemed defective.
        (iii) Not later than thirty days prior  to  such  date  of  sale,  the
      department  of finance shall submit to the council a list, disaggregated
      by council  district,  of  all  properties  for  which  property  owners
      returned  a completed eligibility checklist to the department of finance
      at least thirty-five days prior to the  date  of  sale,  but  for  which
      property  owners  have not yet submitted a completed application for the
      appropriate exemption, credit or other benefit.
        (iv) Not  later  than  thirty  days  after  such  date  of  sale,  the
      department  of finance shall submit to the council a list, disaggregated
      by council  district,  of  all  properties  for  which  property  owners
      returned  a completed eligibility checklist to the department of finance
      prior to the date of sale, but for which property owners  have  not  yet
      submitted  a completed application for the appropriate exemption, credit
      or other benefit.
        (v) Upon the written or verbal request of  such  property  owner,  the
      department  of  finance shall provide prompt assistance to such property
      owner in completing an application for the appropriate exemption, credit
      or other benefit.
        3. The notice provided not less than ninety days prior to the date  of
      sale  shall  also include information relating to the lien sale process,
      including, but not limited to, actions homeowners can take if a lien  is
      sold on such property; the type of debt that can be sold in a lien sale;
      a timeline of statutory notifications required pursuant to this section;
      a  clear,  concise  explanation of the consequences of the sale of a tax
      lien; the telephone number and electronic mail address of  the  employee
      or  employees  designated  pursuant  to subdivision f of this section; a
      conspicuous statement that the owner of the property may  enter  into  a
      payment  plan  for  exclusion  from  the  tax lien sale; and credits and
      property tax exemptions that may exclude certain class one real property
      from a tax lien sale. Such notice shall also include information on  the

      11-245.4 of this title;
        (iii)  the  exemption  for  veterans  pursuant to section four hundred
      fifty-eight of the real property tax law, with respect to real  property
      purchased  with  payments  received as prisoner of war compensation from
      the United States government;
    
        (iv) the exemption for veterans pursuant to paragraph (b)  or  (c)  of
      subdivision  two  of  section  four  hundred  fifty-eight-a  of the real
      property tax law;
        (v) the state circuit breaker income tax credit pursuant to subsection
      (e) of section six hundred six of the tax law; and

      of finance memorandum 05-3, or any successor memorandum thereto.
        Upon  such  property owner's written request, or verbal request to 311
      or any employee designated pursuant to subdivision f of this section,  a
      Chinese,  Korean, Russian or Spanish translation of such notice shall be
      provided promptly to such property owner.
        c. Such notices shall advise the owner of such property of his or  her
      continued  obligation  to pay the amounts due on such property. No other
      notices or demands shall be required to be made to  the  owner  of  such
      property  to  authorize  the  sale  of  a  tax lien or tax liens on such
      property pursuant to section 11-319 of this chapter.
        d. 1. The commissioner of finance or his or her designee shall, within
      ninety days after the delivery of the tax lien certificate,  notify  any
      person  who was required to be notified of such sale pursuant to section
      11-320(b) of this chapter, by first  class  mail,  that  such  sale  has
      occurred.  Such notice shall state the date of the sale of the tax lien,
      the name and address of the purchaser of the tax  lien,  the  amount  of
      such lien, a description of the property by block and lot and such other
      identifying  information  as  the  commissioner of finance or his or her
      designee shall deem appropriate, and the terms and conditions of the tax

      pursuant  to the provisions of this chapter, shall include the following

      lien.
        3. The requirement to send such written communication shall be subject
      to federal, state and local debt collection laws.
        4.  Failure  to  provide notice pursuant to this subdivision shall not
      affect the validity of any sale of a tax lien or tax liens  pursuant  to
      this chapter.
        e.  The words "date of sale" when used in this section shall mean: (1)
      for a negotiated sale, the date of signing  of  the  tax  lien  purchase
      agreement,  and  (2)  for a competitive sale, the date designated by the
      commissioner of finance for the submission of bids.

      purchasing a tax lien or tax liens.
        b. Any person who intends to purchase a tax lien or  tax  liens  in  a
      negotiated  or  competitive  sale  shall  submit  to the commissioner of
      finance  an  affidavit  establishing  compliance  with  the   applicable
      eligibility criteria and including any other information required by the
      commissioner  of  finance.  No  such  person  who  fails  to submit such
      affidavit shall be permitted to purchase a tax lien or  tax  liens.  Any
      such  person  who  willfully  submits  a  false  or misleading affidavit
      pursuant to this section  shall  forfeit  any  tax  lien  or  tax  liens
      purchased by him or her at a sale for which the affidavit was submitted,
      shall  be  liable for payment of the full purchase price of the tax lien
      or tax liens, shall forfeit any deposit paid, and shall be  disqualified

      identified  pursuant  to  section  11-309  of  this chapter as having an
      interest in the property which is the subject of the  tax  lien  or  tax
      liens,  or  to any owner of record as shown on the real property records
      of the office of the city register in any borough or in  the  office  of
      the  Richmond  county  clerk.  Any  such  person  or owner of record who
      purchases such tax lien or tax liens shall forfeit such tax lien or  tax
      liens  and shall be liable for payment of the full purchase price of the
      tax lien or tax liens and shall not be  entitled  to  a  refund  of  any
      amounts paid by such person or owner of record.
        d.  No person who purchases a tax lien or tax liens in a negotiated or
      competitive sale shall assign or transfer a tax lien certificate or  tax
      lien  certificates  for  such  tax  lien  or  tax  liens  to  any person
      identified pursuant to section 11-309  of  this  chapter  as  having  an
      interest  in  the  property  which  is  the  subject  of  such  tax lien
      certificate or tax lien certificates, or  to  any  owner  of  record  of
      property  which  is the subject of such tax lien certificate or tax lien
      certificates. Any such person who knowingly or negligently transfers  or
      assigns  such  tax  lien  certificate  or  tax lien certificates to such
      person or owner of record shall  be  liable  for  payment  of  the  full
      purchase price of the tax lien or tax liens and shall not be entitled to
      a  refund  of any amounts paid and such tax lien certificate or tax lien
      certificates shall be deemed void and the tax lien  or  tax  liens  sold
      under  such certificate or such certificates shall revert to the city as
      if no sale of such tax lien or tax liens had occurred.
    
    
    
    
    
    
    

Section 11-322

Section 11-322 ::    
        
     
        §   11-322   Postponement   or   cancellation  of  sales;  installment
      agreements.  a. It shall be lawful for the commissioner of  finance,  or
      his  or  her  designee, to postpone or cancel any proposed sale of a tax
      lien or tax liens on  property  that  shall  have  been  advertised  and
      noticed  for  sale  prior  to  the  date  of  sale. For purposes of this
      section, the words, "date of sale" shall have the same meaning  provided
      in  section  11-320(e) of this chapter. The city shall not be liable for
      any damages as a result of cancellation or postponement  of  a  proposed
      sale  of  a  tax  lien or tax liens, nor shall any cause of action arise
      from such cancellation or postponement.
        b. In accordance  with  rules  promulgated  by  the  commissioners  of
      finance  and  environmental  protection, a property owner may enter into
      agreements with the departments of finance and environmental  protection
      for  the  payment in installments of any delinquent real property taxes,
      assessments, sewer rents, sewer surcharges, water rents,  or  any  other
      charges  that are made a lien subject to the provisions of this chapter.
      The proposed sale of a tax lien  or  tax  liens  on  property  shall  be
      cancelled  when  a  property  owner  enters  into  an agreement with the
      respective agency for the payment of any such  lien.  Such  rules  shall
      also  provide  that  such property owners be given information regarding
      eligibility for real property tax exemption programs prior  to  entering
      into such agreements.
        1.  If  payments  required  from  a property owner pursuant to such an
      agreement are not made for a period of six months, such  property  owner
      shall  be in default of such agreement, and the tax lien or tax liens on
      the subject property may be sold, provided, however, that  such  default
      may  be  cured  upon  such  property  owner's  bringing  all installment
      payments and all current charges that are outstanding at the time of the
      default to a current status, which shall include, but not be limited to,
      any outstanding interest and fees, prior to the date of  sale.  If  such
      default  is  not  cured  prior  to the date of sale, such property owner
      shall not be eligible to enter into an  installment  agreement  for  the
      subject   property  for  five  years,  unless  there  is  a  finding  of
      extenuating circumstances  by  the  department  that  entered  into  the
      installment agreement with the property owner.
        2. An installment agreement shall provide for payments by the property
      owner  on  a  quarterly  or  monthly  basis,  in  the  discretion of the
      appropriate commissioner, for a period not less than eight years and not
      more than ten years, provided that a property owner may elect  a  period
      less  than eight years. There shall be no down payment required upon the
      property owner's  entering  into  the  installment  agreement  with  the
      respective  department,  but the property owner may elect to make a down
      payment.
        3. Beginning January first, two thousand twelve,  any  property  owner
      who  has  entered into an installment agreement with the commissioner of
      environmental protection  pursuant  to  this  subdivision  and  who  has
      automated  meter  reading  shall receive a consolidated monthly bill for
      current sewer rents, sewer surcharges and water rents  and  any  payment
      due under such installment agreement.
        4.   No   later   than  September  first,  two  thousand  eleven,  the
      commissioners of finance and environmental protection  shall  promulgate
      rules  governing  installment  agreements, including but not limited to,
      the terms and conditions of such agreements, the payment schedules,  and
      the definition and consequences of default.

      require from each purchaser of a tax lien or tax liens, in cash or  cash
      equivalent  in  immediately  available  funds  in the discretion of such
      commissioner, a deposit of at least five per cent of the cash portion of
      the sale price of the tax lien or tax liens purchased by him or her,  as
      liquidated damages, on a date determined by the commissioner of finance.
      The balance shall be paid to the commissioner of finance in cash or cash
      equivalent  in  immediately  available funds or such other consideration
      acceptable to the commissioner of finance or any combination thereof, in
      his or her discretion. For purposes of this  chapter  "cash  equivalent"
      shall  mean a cashier's check, bank check, certified check, money order,
      or such other paper instrument as  the  commissioner  of  finance  shall
      prescribe. Such deposit and balance may also be paid by electronic funds
      transfer.  For  purposes  of  this  chapter, "electronic funds transfer"
      shall mean any transfer of funds, other than a transaction originated by
      check, draft or similar paper instrument, which  is  initiated  using  a
      format prescribed by the commissioner of finance. A tax lien certificate
      shall  be  made  and delivered to the purchaser upon payment of the sale
      price. In case any purchaser shall default in any obligation  under  the
      terms  and conditions of the tax lien sale, then the amount deposited by
      the purchaser shall be forfeited to the city, and the tax  lien  or  tax
      liens  upon  the property affected by such purchase may be sold again at
      the discretion of the commissioner of finance pursuant to section 11-319
      of this chapter. All deposits forfeited as aforesaid shall be paid  into
      the general fund.

      described  therein  for  the  taxes,  assessments,  sewer  rents,  sewer
      surcharges, water rents, any other charges that are made a lien  subject

      commissioner  of  finance or his or her designee may deem proper to add.
      For purposes of this section, the words "date of sale"  shall  have  the
      same  meaning  provided  in  section 11-320(e) of this chapter. Each tax
      lien certificate shall be executed by the commissioner of finance or his

      acknowledged  by  the  manual  or  facsimile  signature  of  the officer
      subscribing the same in the manner in which a deed  is  required  to  be
      acknowledged to be recorded in the county in which the property affected

      of sales of tax liens, and a copy of each tax lien certificate issued by
      such  commissioner  or  his  or  her  designee.  Assignments of tax lien
      certificates duly acknowledged may be filed and recorded in  the  office
      of  the  commissioner  of  finance  or  his  or her designee. A tax lien
      certificate and any assignment  thereof,  duly  acknowledged,  shall  be
      deemed conveyances under article eight of the real property law, and may
      be  recorded  in  the  office  of the recording officer of any county in

      certificates  and all assignments thereof shall be recorded by recording

      certificate made by the city through the commissioner of finance or  his
      or her designee.

      without  further  proof.  A  transcript of any record enumerated in this
      section, duly certified, shall be evidence in any  court  in  the  state
      with like effect as the original instrument of record.
    
    
    
    
    
    
    

Section 11-332
--------------

Section 11-332 ::    
        
     
        §  11-332  Rights  of purchaser of tax lien. a. Any purchaser of a tax
      lien or tax liens shall stand in the same position as the city and shall
      have all the rights and remedies that the city would have had if the tax
      lien or tax liens had not been sold.
        b. The aggregate amount of each tax lien transferred pursuant to  this
      chapter  shall  be  due  and payable one year from the date of the sale.
      Until such aggregate amount is fully paid and discharged, the holder  of
      the  tax  lien certificate shall be entitled to receive interest on such
      aggregate amount from the date of sale, and semi-annually at the rate of
      interest applicable in accordance with section 11-319 of  this  chapter.
      If  such  aggregate amount is partially paid, the holder of the tax lien
      certificate shall be entitled to receive interest  only  on  the  amount
      that  remains unpaid. Notwithstanding the foregoing sentence, the holder
      of the tax lien certificate shall be entitled to receive  and  retain  a
      surcharge  equal  to  five  percent  of the lien arising pursuant to the
      provisions of this chapter as a  result  of  the  nonpayment  of  taxes,
      assessments,  sewer  rents,  sewer  surcharges,  water  rents, any other
      charges that are made a lien subject to the provisions of this  chapter,
      the  costs  of  any  advertisements  and  notices given pursuant to this
      chapter, any other charges that are due and payable,  and  interest  and
      penalties  thereon. Any amounts due shall be paid directly to the holder
      of the tax lien certificate. At the option of the holder of any tax lien
      certificate  the  aggregate  amount  thereof  shall  become  subject  to
      foreclosure  after default in the payment of interest for thirty days or
      after default for six months after the date of sale stated  in  the  tax
      lien  certificate  in  accordance  with sections 11-320(d) and 11-328 of
      this chapter in the payment of  any  taxes,  assessments,  sewer  rents,
      sewer  surcharges,  water  rents, any other charges that are made a lien
      subject to the provisions of this chapter, or the interest or  penalties
      thereon which become a lien on or after the date of sale of the tax lien
      transferred  by  such  tax  lien  certificate. At his or her option, the
      holder of the tax lien certificate may satisfy any such  subsequent  tax
      lien on the same property, and shall, by virtue of such satisfaction, be
      deemed  to be in the same position as if he or she were a purchaser of a
      tax lien certificate for such subsequent tax  lien,  provided,  however,
      that  such  holder  shall  not  be  entitled  to  receive a five percent
      surcharge on such subsequent tax lien pursuant to this section. The rate
      of interest on such subsequent  lien  shall  be  the  rate  of  interest
      applicable  to  tax lien certificates pursuant to section 11-319 of this
      chapter. The commissioner of finance or his  or  her  designee,  at  the
      request of the purchaser of such subsequent lien, shall issue a tax lien
      certificate for such lien pursuant to sections 11-327 and 11-328 of this
      chapter.  Upon issuance of such certificate, the commissioner of finance
      or his or her designee shall provide such notice as is required pursuant
      to section 11-320(d) of this chapter. Failure to provide notice pursuant
      to this subdivision shall not affect the validity of any transfer  of  a
      subsequent  tax  lien  or  tax  liens  pursuant to this subdivision. Any
      person having a legal or beneficial interest in property affected  by  a
      tax  lien  certificate  may satisfy the same at any time upon payment of
      the amounts due with interest at the rate applicable in accordance  with
      section  11-319  of this chapter. Upon satisfaction of the tax lien, the
      holder thereof shall issue to the person who satisfied such tax  lien  a
      certificate  of discharge, certifying that the tax lien has been paid or
      has been otherwise satisfied,  in  such  recordable  form  as  has  been
      approved  by  the commissioner of finance. For purposes of this section,
      the words, "date of sale"  shall  have  the  same  meaning  provided  in
      section 11-320(e) of this chapter.

      certificate  of  discharge issued by the holder of the tax lien pursuant
      to section 11-332 of this chapter to the recording officer of the county

Section 11-335
--------------

Section 11-335 ::    
        
     
        § 11-335 Foreclosure of tax liens. If the amount of any tax lien which
      shall  have been transferred by a tax lien certificate shall not be paid
      when under its terms and  the  provisions  of  section  11-332  of  this
      chapter  such  amount  shall  be  due,  the  holder  of  such  tax  lien
      certificate may maintain an action in the  supreme  court  to  foreclose
      such  tax lien. The holder of such tax lien certificate shall notify the
      commissioner of finance or his or her designee in writing whenever he or
      she commences such action at the time of  filing  of  such  action,  and
      shall notify the commissioner of finance in writing of the resolution of
      such action, including any settlement of such action, within thirty days
      of  such  resolution.  In  an  action to foreclose a tax lien any person
      shall be a proper party of whom the plaintiff alleges that  such  person
      has  or  may  have or that the plaintiff has reason to believe that such
      person has or may have  an  interest  in  or  claim  upon  the  property
      affected  by  the  tax lien. A plaintiff in an action to foreclose a tax
      lien shall recover  reasonable  attorney's  fees  for  maintaining  such
      action.  Except  as  otherwise  provided  in  this  chapter an action to
      foreclose a tax lien shall be regulated by the provisions of  the  civil
      practice  law and rules and by all other provisions of law, and rules of
      practice applicable to actions to foreclose mortgages on real  property.
      The  people of the state of New York or the city of New York may be made
      party to an action to foreclose a tax lien  in  the  same  manner  as  a
      natural person. Where the people of the state of New York or the city of
      New  York  are  made a party defendant the complaint shall set forth, in
      addition to the other matters required to be set forth by law,  detailed
      facts  showing  the  particular nature of the interest in or the lien on
      such property of the people of the state of New York or the city of  New
      York,  and  detailed facts showing the particular nature of the interest
      in or the lien on such property which plaintiff has  reason  to  believe
      that the people of the state of New York or the city of New York have or
      may  have  in such property, and the reason for making the people of the
      state of New York or the city  of  New  York  a  party  defendant.  Upon
      failure  to  state such facts the complaint shall be dismissed as to the
      people of the state or the city of New York.

--------------

Section 11-336 ::    
        
     
        §  11-336  Pleading  tax lien certificate. Whenever a cause of action,
      defense or counterclaim, is for the foreclosure of a tax lien, or is  in
      any  manner  founded  upon  a  tax  lien  or a tax lien certificate, the
      production in evidence of an instrument executed by the commissioner  of
      finance  or his or her designee in the form prescribed in section 11-328
      of this chapter for a tax lien certificate subscribed by or in behalf of
      the commissioner of finance or his or her designee shall be  presumptive
      evidence that the lien purported to be transferred by such an instrument
      was  a valid and enforceable lien, and that it has been duly assigned to
      the purchaser, and it shall not be necessary to plead or prove any  act,
      proceeding,  notice  or  action, preceding the delivery of such tax lien
      certificate nor to establish the validity of the tax lien transferred by
      such tax lien certificate. If a party or person in interest in any  such
      action  or proceeding claims that a tax lien is irregular or invalid, or
      that there is any defect therein or  that  a  tax  lien  certificate  is
      irregular, invalid or defective, such invalidity, irregularity or defect

      the  purchaser  all  the  right, title, interest and estate in and claim
      upon the real property affected by such judgment, of the plaintiff, each
      defendant upon whom the summons is served, each  person  claiming  from,
      through  or under such a defendant by title accruing after the filing of
      notice of pendency of the action or after  the  entry  of  judgment  and
      filing  of  the  judgment  roll in the proper county clerk's office, and
      each person not in being when the judgment is rendered,  who  afterwards
      may  become entitled to a beneficial interest attaching to, or an estate
      or interest in such real property or any portion thereof, provided  that
      the person presumptively entitled to such beneficial interest, estate or
