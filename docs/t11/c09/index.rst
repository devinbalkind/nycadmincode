Section 11-905 ::    
        
     
        § 11-905 Interest and penalties. (a) Interest on underpayments. If any
      amount  of  tax  is  not  paid on or before the last date prescribed for
      payment (without regard to any extension of time granted  for  payment),
      interest on such amount at the underpayment rate set by the commissioner
      of  finance  pursuant to subdivision (g) of this section, or, if no rate
      is set, at the rate of seven and one-half percent per  annum,  shall  be
      paid  for  the  period  from  such  last date to the date of payment. In
      computing the amount of interest to be  paid,  such  interest  shall  be
      compounded  daily.  Interest under this subdivision shall not be paid if
      the amount thereof is less than one dollar.
        (b) * (1) Failure to file return. (A) In case of  failure  to  file  a
      return  under  this chapter on or before the prescribed date (determined
      with regard to any extension of time for filing),  unless  it  is  shown
      that  such  failure  is  due  to reasonable cause and not due to willful
      neglect, there shall be added to the amount required to be shown as  tax
      on  such return five percent of the amount of such tax if the failure is
      for not more than one month, with an additional five  percent  for  each
      additional   month   or  fraction  thereof  during  which  such  failure
      continues, not exceeding twenty-five percent in the aggregate.
        (B) In the case of a failure to file a return of tax within sixty days
      of the date prescribed for filing of such return (determined with regard
      to any extension of time for filing),  unless  it  is  shown  that  such
      failure  is  due to reasonable cause and not due to willful neglect, the
      addition to tax under subparagraph (A) of this paragraph  shall  not  be
      less  than  the  lesser of one hundred dollars or one hundred percent of
      the amount required to be shown as tax on such return.
        (C) For purposes of this paragraph, the amount of tax required  to  be
      shown  on  the  return shall be reduced by the amount of any part of the
      tax which is paid on or before the date prescribed for  payment  of  the
      tax and by the amount of any credit against the tax which may be claimed
      upon the return.
        * NB Amended Ch. 765/85 § 43, language juxtaposed per Ch. 907/85 § 14
        (2)  Failure to pay tax shown on return. In case of failure to pay the
      amount shown as tax on a return required to be filed under this  chapter
      on  or  before  the  prescribed  date  (determined  with  regard  to any
      extension of time for payment), unless it is shown that such failure  is
      due  to  reasonable cause and not due to willful neglect, there shall be
      added to the amount shown as tax on such return one-half of one  percent
      of the amount of such tax if the failure is not for more than one month,
      with  an additional one-half of one percent for each additional month or
      fraction thereof during which  such  failure  continues,  not  exceeding
      twenty-five  percent  in the aggregate. For the purpose of computing the
      addition for any month the amount of tax shown on the  return  shall  be
      reduced  by the amount of any part of the tax which is paid on or before
      the beginning of such month and by the amount of any credit against  the
      tax  which may be claimed upon the return. If the amount of tax required
      to be shown on a return is less than the amount shown  as  tax  on  such
      return,  this  paragraph  shall  be  applied  by substituting such lower
      amount.
        (3) Failure to pay tax required to be shown  on  return.  In  case  of
      failure  to pay any amount in respect of any tax required to be shown on
      a return required to be filed under this chapter which is not  so  shown
      (including  a  determination  made  pursuant  to  section 11-906 of this
      chapter) within ten days of the date of a notice  and  demand  therefor,
      unless  it is shown that such failure is due to reasonable cause and not
      due to willful neglect, there shall be added to the amount of tax stated
      in such notice and demand one-half of one percent of  such  tax  if  the
      failure  is  not for more than one month, with an additional one-half of
    
      one percent for each additional month or fraction thereof  during  which
      such  failure  continues,  not  exceeding  twenty-five  percent  in  the
      aggregate. For the purpose of computing the addition for any month,  the
      amount  of  tax  stated in the notice and demand shall be reduced by the
      amount of any part of the tax which is paid before the beginning of such
      month.
        * (4) Limitations on additions.
        (A) With respect to any return,  the  amount  of  the  addition  under
      paragraph  one of this subdivision shall be reduced by the amount of the
      addition under paragraph two of this subdivision for any month to  which
      an   addition  applies  under  both  paragraphs  one  and  two  of  this
      subdivision. In any case described in subparagraph (B) of paragraph  one
      of this subdivision, the amount of the addition under such paragraph one
      shall not be reduced below the amount provided in such subparagraph.
        (B)  With  respect  to  any return, the maximum amount of the addition
      permitted under paragraph three of this subdivision shall be reduced  by
      the  amount  of  the  addition  under  paragraph one of this subdivision
      (determined without regard to subparagraph (B) of  such  paragraph  one)
      which is attributable to the tax for which the notice and demand is made
      and which is not paid within ten days of such notice and demand.
        * NB Amended Ch. 765/85 § 43, language juxtaposed per Ch. 907/85 § 14
        * (c)   Underpayment  due  to  negligence.  (1)  If  any  part  of  an
      underpayment of tax is due to negligence  or  intentional  disregard  of
      this  chapter or any rules and regulations hereunder (but without intent
      to defraud), there shall be added to the tax a  penalty  equal  to  five
      percent of the underpayment.
        (2)  There  shall  be  added  to  the  tax  (in addition to the amount
      determined under paragraph one of this subdivision) an amount  equal  to
      fifty  percent  of  the  interest  payable under subdivision (a) of this
      section with respect to the portion of  the  underpayment  described  in
      such   paragraph   one  which  is  attributable  to  the  negligence  or
      intentional disregard referred to in such paragraph one, for the  period
      beginning  on  the  last  date  prescribed  by  law  for payment of such
      underpayment (determined without regard to any extension) and ending  on
      the  date  of the assessment of the tax (or, if earlier, the date of the
      payment of the tax).
        * NB Amended Ch. 765/85 § 43, language juxtaposed per Ch. 907/85 § 14
        * (d) Underpayment due to fraud. (1) If any part of an underpayment of
      tax is due to fraud, there shall be added to the tax a penalty equal  to
      fifty percent of the underpayment.
        (2)  There  shall  be  added  to  the  tax (in addition to the penalty
      determined under paragraph one of this subdivision) an amount  equal  to
      fifty  percent  of  the  interest  payable under subdivision (a) of this
      section with respect to the portion of  the  underpayment  described  in
      such  paragraph  one  which  is  attributable  to  fraud, for the period
      beginning on the  last  day  prescribed  by  law  for  payment  of  such
      underpayment  (determined without regard to any extension) and ending on
      the date of the assessment of the tax (or, if earlier, the date  of  the
      payment of the tax).
        (3)  The  penalty under this subdivision shall be in lieu of any other
      addition to tax imposed by subdivision (b) or (c) of this section.
        * NB Amended Ch. 765/85 § 43, language juxtaposed per Ch. 907/85 § 14
        (e) Additional penalty. Any insurer who, with fraudulent intent, shall
      fail to pay any tax imposed by this chapter, or to make, render, sign or
      certify any return,  or  to  supply  any  information  within  the  time
      required  by or under this chapter, shall be liable for a penalty of not
      more than one  thousand  dollars,  in  addition  to  any  other  amounts
      required under this chapter to be imposed, assessed and collected by the
    
      commissioner  of  finance.  The  commissioner  of finance shall have the
      power, in his or her discretion, to  waive,  reduce  or  compromise  any
      penalty under this subdivision.
        (f)  The  interest and penalties imposed by this section shall be paid
      and disposed of in the same manner as other revenues from this  chapter.
      Unpaid  interest and penalties may be enforced in the same manner as the
      tax imposed by this chapter.
        (g) (1) Authority to set interest rates. The commissioner  of  finance
      shall  set the overpayment and underpayment rates of interest to be paid
      pursuant to subdivision (a) of  this  section  and  subdivision  (a)  of
      section  11-906  of  this  chapter,  but  if no such overpayment rate of
      interest are set, such rate or rates shall be deemed to be  set  at  six
      percent  per  annum and such underpayment rate shall be deemed to be set
      at seven and one-half  percent  per  annum.  Such  rates  shall  be  the
      overpayment  and  underpayment rates prescribed in paragraph two of this
      subdivision but the underpayment rate shall not be less than  seven  and
      one-half  percent  per  annum. Any such rates set by the commissioner of
      finance shall apply to taxes, or any portion thereof,  which  remain  or
      become  due  or overpaid on or after the date on which such rates become
      effective and shall apply only with  respect  to  interest  computed  or
      computable for periods or portions of periods occurring in the period in
      which such rates are in effect.
        (2) General rule. (A) Overpayment rate. The overpayment rate set under

      provided under paragraph  three  of  this  subdivision,  plus  (ii)  two
      percentage points.
        (B)   Underpayment   rate.   The  underpayment  rate  set  under  this
      subdivision shall be the sum of  (i)  the  federal  short-term  rate  as
      provided  under  paragraph  three  of  this subdivision, plus (ii) seven
      percentage points.
        (3) Federal short-term rate. For purposes of this subdivision:
        (A) The federal short-term rate for any month  shall  be  the  federal
      short-term  rate  determined  by  the  United  States  secretary  of the
      treasury during such month in accordance with subsection (d) of  section
      twelve  hundred  seventy-four  of  the  internal revenue code for use in
      connection with section six  thousand  six  hundred  twenty-one  of  the
      internal  revenue  code.  Any  such rate shall be rounded to the nearest
      full percent (or, if a multiple of one-half of one  percent,  such  rate
      shall be increased to the next highest full percent).
        (B) Period during which rate applies.
        (i)   In   general.   Except  as  provided  in  clause  (ii)  of  this
      subparagraph, the federal short-term rate for the first  month  in  each

      after such month.
        (ii)  Special  rule  for  the  month  of  September,  nineteen hundred
      eighty-nine. The  federal  short-term  rate  for  the  month  of  April,
      nineteen  hundred  eighty-nine  shall  apply with respect to setting the
      rate  of  interest  for  the  month  of  September,   nineteen   hundred
      eighty-nine.
        (4)  Publication  of  interest rate. The commissioner of finance shall
      cause to be published in the city record,  and  give  other  appropriate
      general notice of, the interest rate to be set under this subdivision no
      later  than  twenty days preceding the first day of the calendar quarter
      during which such interest rate applies. The setting and publication  of
      such  interest  rate  shall  not  be  included  within  paragraph (a) of
      subdivision five of section one thousand forty-one of the  city  charter
      relating to the definition of a rule.

Section 11-906 ::    
        
     
        §  11-906 Assessment, refund, collection, review and reserves. (a) The
      provisions of the civil practice law and rules or any other law relative
      to limitations of time for the enforcement of a civil remedy  shall  not
      apply  to  any  proceeding  or  action by the commissioner of finance to
      levy, assess, determine or enforce the collection of  tax,  interest  or
      penalty  imposed  by  this  chapter.  However,  except  in the case of a
      wilfully false or fraudulent report, no assessment  of  additional  tax,
      interest  or  penalty  shall  be  made after the expiration of more than
      three years from the date of the filing of a report, provided,  however,
      that  where  no  report has been filed as provided by law the tax may be
      assessed at any time.  The  commissioner  of  finance  shall  refund  or
      credit, with interest at the overpayment rate set by the commissioner of
      finance  pursuant  to  subdivision (g) of section 11-905 of this chapter
      or, if no rate is set, at the rate of six  percent  per  annum  computed
      from  the  date  of  overpayment  to  a  date  (to  be determined by the
      commissioner of finance) preceding the date of a  refund  check  by  not
      more  than  thirty  days,  any  tax,  penalty  or  interest erroneously,
      illegally or unconstitutionally collected or paid if application to  the
      commissioner  of finance for such refund shall be made within six months
      from  the  payment  thereof.  Notice  of  any   determination   of   the
      commissioner  of  finance with respect to an assessment of tax, interest
      or penalty or with respect to a claim for refund or  any  other  notice,
      demand  or  request shall be given by mailing the same to the insurer to
      the address of its New York city office last filed with the commissioner
      of finance or, if there is no such office, to the address  of  its  main
      office last filed with the commissioner of finance or, in the absence of
      any  filed address, to such address as may be obtainable. The mailing of
      any notice, demand or request by the commissioner of  finance  shall  be
      presumptive  evidence  of  its  receipt by the insurer and any period of
      time to be determined with reference  to  the  giving  of  such  notice,
      demand  or  request shall commence to run from the date of such mailing.
      The determination of the  commissioner  of  finance  shall  finally  and
      irrevocably  fix the amount of any tax, interest or penalty due or to be
      refunded unless the taxpayer, within ninety days  after  the  giving  of
      notice  of  such  determination,  or  if the commissioner of finance has
      established a conciliation procedure pursuant to section 11-124  of  the
      code  and  the  taxpayer  has  requested  a  conciliation  conference in
      accordance  therewith,  within  ninety  days  from  the  mailing  of   a
      conciliation  decision or the date of the commissioner's confirmation of
      the discontinuance of the conciliation proceeding,  both  (1)  serves  a
      petition  upon the commissioner of finance and (2) files a petition with
      the tax appeals tribunal for a hearing, or unless  the  commissioner  of
      finance  of  his  or  her  own  motion  shall redetermine the same. Such
      hearing and any appeal to the tax appeals tribunal sitting en banc  from
      the  decision  rendered in such hearing shall be conducted in the manner
      and subject to the requirements prescribed by the tax  appeals  tribunal
      pursuant  to  sections  one  hundred  sixty-eight  through  one  hundred
      seventy-two of the charter. After such hearing the tax appeals  tribunal
      shall   give  notice  of  its  decision  to  the  taxpayer  and  to  the
      commissioner of finance  with  reference  to  the  amount  of  the  tax,
      interest  or penalty assessed or to be refunded. The decision of the tax
      appeals  tribunal  sitting  en  banc  shall  be  reviewable  for  error,
      illegality  or  unconstitutionality or any other reason, by a proceeding
      under article seventy-eight of the civil practice law and rules if  such
      proceeding  is commenced by the person against whom the tax was assessed
      within four months after the giving of the notice of  such  tax  appeals
      tribunal  decision.  Such  proceeding  shall  not  be  commenced  by the
      taxpayer unless: (1) the amount of any tax assessed  and  sought  to  be
    
      reviewed  with  penalties  and  interest thereon, if any, shall be first
      deposited with the commissioner of finance and there shall be filed with
      the commissioner of finance an undertaking in such amount and with  such
      sureties  as a justice of the supreme court shall approve, to the effect
      that if such proceeding be dismissed  or  the  decision  confirmed,  the
      taxpayer  will  pay  all  costs and charges which may accrue against the
      taxpayer in the prosecution of the proceeding, or (2) in the case  of  a
      review of a decision assessing any taxes, penalties and interest, at the
      option  of  the taxpayer, such undertaking may be in a sum sufficient to
      cover all of the taxes, penalties and interest assessed by such decision
      plus the costs and charges which may accrue against the taxpayer in  the
      prosecution  of the proceeding, in which event the taxpayer shall not be
      required to deposit such taxes, penalties and interest  as  a  condition
      precedent  to  the  commencement  of the proceeding. No determination or
      proposed determination of tax, interest or penalty due or to be refunded
      shall be reviewed or enjoined in any manner except as set forth herein.
        (b) In cases where the taxpayer has  applied  for  a  refund  and  has
      commenced a proceeding under article seventy-eight of the civil practice
      law  and  rules to review a decision of the tax appeals tribunal adverse
      to such taxpayer on its application for a refund,  the  commissioner  of
      finance  shall  set up appropriate reserves to meet any decision adverse

        b.  Persons  entitled to benefits from fund. All funds received by the
      fire commissioner as trustee under this paragraph shall be  expended  by

        (i)  all  indigent  volunteer  firefighters  who  served as such for a
      period of five years in a duly organized volunteer fire company  in  the
      former towns of New Lots, Flatlands, Gravesend, New Utrecht and Flatbush

        c.   Fund   benefits   of   beneficiaries  on  rolls  as  of  December

      nineteen hundred fifty-one upon the  records  of  the  trustees  of  the
      exempt  firemen's  benevolent  fund  of  the  county of Kings, or of the
      trustees of the exempt firemen's  benevolent  fund  of  the  borough  of
      Queens,  or  of  the trustees of the exempt firemen's benevolent fund of
      the borough of Staten Island, or of the trustees of the exempt firemen's
      benevolent fund of the borough of the Bronx, it shall be the duty of the
      fire commissioner, as such trustee, to pay to  such  beneficiaries  from
      the  volunteer  firemen's  benevolent fund referred to in subparagraph a
      hereof, the same  amounts  as  were  being  periodically  paid  to  such
      beneficiaries as of June thirtieth, nineteen hundred fifty-two.
        d.  Fund benefits of residents of firemen's home. It shall be the duty
      of the fire commissioner,  as  such  trustee,  to  pay  from  such  fund
      referred  to  in  subparagraph a, the sum of ten dollars monthly to each
      volunteer firefighter in residence at the volunteer  firemen's  home  at
      Hudson,  who  qualified for entrance into such home by reason of service
      as a volunteer firefighter within  the  area  now  included  within  the
      boundaries of the city of New York. No other payments shall be made from
      such  fund  to any such volunteer firefighter while in residence at such
      home.
        e. Eligibility of persons who applied for fund benefits after December
      thirty-first, nineteen hundred fifty-one, and prior to the establishment
    
      of fund. Upon the establishment of the  volunteer  firemen's  benevolent
      fund  referred to in subparagraph a hereof, the fire commissioner or the
      fire  commissioner's  authorized  subordinates  shall  investigate   and
      determine  the  need  for  benefits  of  all persons who, after December
      thirty-first, nineteen hundred fifty-one and prior to the  establishment
      of  such  volunteer  firemen's  benevolent  fund,  applied  for benefits
      payable from any of the benevolent funds  mentioned  in  subparagraph  c
      hereof,  and  who  are  receiving  benefits therefrom at the time of the
      establishment of such fund referred to in subparagraph a. No such person
      shall be found to be in need of benefits, nor shall any such  person  be
      paid  any  benefits  from  such  last-mentioned  fund  unless  the  fire
      commissioner or the fire commissioner's  authorized  subordinates  shall
      determine  that  such  person  is  indigent.  In the event that any such
      person is thus found to be in need of benefits,  the  fire  commissioner
      shall  pay  to  such  person  from  such  last-mentioned  fund, the same
      periodic amounts as the trustees mentioned in subparagraph c hereof were
      paying as of June thirtieth, nineteen hundred fifty-two, to a person who
      had the same status and who was receiving benefits from the  borough  or
      county  fund which would be currently liable for the payment of benefits
      to such person, but for the provision of section 13-532 of the code.  It
      shall  be  the duty of the fire commissioner and the fire commissioner's
      authorized subordinates to maintain and  carry  out  continuously,  such
      investigation  procedures  as  may  be necessary to assure that benefits
      will not be paid from such fund to any persons who are not  in  need  as
      herein specified.
        f.  Eligibility  for  benefits  of  persons  applying  therefor  after
      establishment of fund. All persons applying after the  establishment  of
      the  volunteer  firemen's benevolent fund for benefits payable therefrom
      shall be investigated as to need by the fire commissioner  or  the  fire
      commissioner's  authorized  subordinates,  and  the  eligibility of such
      persons for benefits and the amount thereof to be awarded  and  paid  to
      them   shall  be  determined  by  the  fire  commissioner  or  the  fire
      commissioner's authorized subordinates in accordance with the  standards
      specified  in  subparagraph  e  hereof. Benefits shall be paid from such
      fund to eligible persons in accordance with such  determination  and  it
      shall  be  the duty of the fire commissioner and the fire commissioner's
      subordinates continuously to maintain and carry out as to  such  persons
      investigation procedures such as are described in subparagraph e hereof.
      The  fire commissioner, as part of his or her investigation to determine
      eligibility of persons for fund benefits, shall request  from  the  duly
      appointed representative of the volunteer firefighters in each borough a
      report  on  such  person's  service  and indigency. Such report shall be
      solely for the information of the fire commissioner  and  shall  not  be
      binding  upon the fire commissioner in arriving at a determination as to
      eligibility. In the event that such report is not submitted  within  ten
      days  from  the  date  of request, the fire commissioner shall determine
      eligibility  on  the  basis  of  the  facts  developed   in   the   fire
      commissioner's own investigation.
        g.  Excess  moneys.  In  the  event that the benefits paid by the fire
      commissioner, as trustee, during any period of one year beginning on the
      first day of February shall not equal  the  sum  of  one  hundred  fifty
      thousand  dollars, the unexpended balance shall be paid into the general
      fund of the city established pursuant to section one hundred nine of the
      charter, except that the fire commissioner may retain in  the  volunteer
      firemen's  benevolent  fund  such amount as may be necessary to meet the
      commitments of such fund until the revenue from the tax collected  under
      this chapter in the ensuing taxable year shall become available.
    
        h.   Depositories.  The  fire  commissioner,  as  trustee,  is  hereby
      empowered and directed to receive all moneys  and  assets  belonging  or
      payable  to  such  volunteer firemen's benevolent fund and shall deposit
      all such moneys to the credit of such fund in banks and trust  companies
      to be selected by the fire commissioner.
        i.  Bond. The fire commissioner, as trustee of such fund, shall give a
      bond with one or more sureties, in a sum  sufficient  for  the  faithful
      performance  of his or her duties, such bond to be approved as to amount
      and adequacy, by the comptroller and filed in the comptroller's office.
        j. Records. The officers and employees of the fire department who  are
      responsible for the maintenance of the books and records of the New York
      fire department pension fund shall have charge of, and keep the accounts
      of   the  fire  commissioner  as  trustee  of  the  volunteer  firemen's
      benevolent fund.
        k. Reports. The  fire  commissioner,  as  trustee  of  such  volunteer
      firemen's  benevolent  fund,  shall submit to the mayor on or before the
      first day of April of each year, a verified report in which shall be set
      forth the account of the fire commissioner's proceedings as such trustee
      during the twelve-month period ending on the thirty-first day of January
      immediately preceding. Such report shall  include  a  statement  of  all
      receipts and disbursements on account of such benevolent fund, a list of
      the  names,  residences  and  as  nearly  as  possible,  the ages of the
      beneficiaries of such fund and  the  respective  amounts  paid  to  them
      during such period.
        1.  Audit. The comptroller shall have the power to audit the books and
      records of the fire commissioner as trustee of the  volunteer  firemen's
      benevolent fund.
        (b)  The  moneys received by the fire commissioner as trustee pursuant
      to the provisions of paragraph three of subdivision (a) of this  section
      shall  be  expended  by  the  fire commissioner only as provided in such
      paragraph.
