        §  11-124 Conciliation conferences. a. The commissioner of finance may
      establish  a  procedure  for  providing  conciliation  conferences   for
      purposes  of  settling  contested  determinations of taxes or charges or
      denials of refunds or credits with respect to taxes or  charges  imposed
      under  chapter  five, six, seven, eight, nine, eleven, twelve, thirteen,
      fourteen, fifteen, twenty-one, twenty-two, twenty-four,  twenty-five  or
      twenty-seven  of  this  title,  or  for the purpose of settling disputes
      arising from the notification of the refusal to grant, the suspension or
      the revocation of a license issued pursuant to chapter thirteen of  this
      title.  If  such  a  procedure is established, a conciliation conference
      shall be provided at the option of any  taxpayer  or  any  other  person
      subject  to the provisions of any of such chapters. For purposes of this
      subdivision, if the commissioner of finance fails to act with respect to
      a refund application before the expiration  of  the  time  period  after
      which  the  taxpayer may file a petition for refund with the tax appeals
      tribunal established by section one hundred sixty-eight of  the  charter
      pursuant  to  subdivision  (c) of section 11-529 or subdivision three of
      section 11-680 of the code, such failure  shall  be  deemed  to  be  the
      denial of a refund.
        b. A request for a conciliation conference shall be made in the manner
      set  forth  in  rules  promulgated  by  the commissioner of finance and,
      notwithstanding any provision of law to the contrary, shall suspend  the
      running  of  the period of limitations for the filing of a petition with
      the tax appeals tribunal under chapter five, six,  seven,  eight,  nine,
      eleven,  twelve,  thirteen,  fourteen,  fifteen, twenty-one, twenty-two,
      twenty-four, twenty-five or twenty-seven of this title until  such  time
      as  a  conciliation decision is rendered by the commissioner of finance,
      or until the person who requested the conciliation  conference  makes  a
      written  request  to  discontinue  or  withdraw  from  the  conciliation
      proceeding.
        c. Nothing contained herein shall prevent any taxpayer  or  any  other
      person  who has received a notice of determination, notice of deficiency
      or notice of denial of a claim for refund from filing  a  petition  with
      the  tax appeals tribunal if the time for filing such a petition has not
      elapsed.
        d. The commissioner of finance is authorized and  empowered  to  make,
      adopt  and  amend  rules appropriate to the carrying out of this section

        §  11-125 Temporary amnesty program; commercial rent or occupancy tax,
      utility tax, real property transfer tax and hotel room occupancy tax. a.
      Notwithstanding  any  other  provision  of  law  to  the  contrary,  the
      commissioner  of  finance shall establish a three-month amnesty program,
      to be effective during the fiscal year of the city beginning July first,
      nineteen hundred ninety-four, for all  taxpayers  owing  any  commercial
      rent  or  occupancy  tax imposed by chapter seven of this title, utility
      tax imposed by chapter eleven of this title, real property transfer  tax
      imposed  by chapter twenty-one of this title or hotel room occupancy tax
      imposed by chapter twenty-five of this title. Such amnesty program shall
      apply, (1) in the case of the commercial rent or occupancy tax,  to  tax
      liabilities  for  tax  periods  ending  on  or  before May thirty-first,
      nineteen hundred ninety-three, (2) in the case of the  utility  tax,  to
      tax  liabilities for tax periods ending on or before March thirty-first,
      nineteen hundred ninety-four, (3) in  the  case  of  the  real  property
      transfer tax, to tax liabilities arising out of taxable events occurring
      before  April first, nineteen hundred ninety-four and (4) in the case of
      the hotel room occupancy tax, to tax liabilities for tax periods  ending
      on  or  before  February  twenty-eighth,  nineteen  hundred ninety-four.
      Amnesty  tax  return  forms  shall  be  in  a  form  prescribed  by  the
      commissioner  of  finance  and  shall  provide for specifications by the
      taxpayer of the tax and the taxable period or taxable  event  for  which
      amnesty  is being sought. The taxpayer must also provide such additional
      information as is required by the commissioner of finance. Amnesty shall
      be granted only for the  tax  and  taxable  periods  or  taxable  events
      specified  by  the  taxpayer  on  such forms (hereinafter referred to as
      "designated taxes").
        b. Such amnesty program shall provide that upon written application by
      any taxpayer, and upon evidence of payment to the city of  New  York  by
      such taxpayer of all designated taxes plus interest, the commissioner of
      finance shall waive any penalties which may be applicable, and no civil,
      administrative or criminal action or proceeding shall be brought against
      the  taxpayer relating to the designated taxes plus interest. Failure to
      pay all designated taxes plus  interest  shall  invalidate  any  amnesty
      granted pursuant to this section.
        c.  Amnesty shall not be granted to any taxpayer who is the subject of
      any criminal investigation being conducted by any agency of the city  of
      New  York  or  of  the  state  of  New York or any political subdivision
      thereof or to any taxpayer who is a  party  to  any  civil  or  criminal
      litigation which is pending on the date of the taxpayer's application in
      any court of this state or the United States for nonpayment, delinquency
      or  fraud  in  relation  to any of the designated taxes plus interest. A
      civil litigation shall not be deemed  to  be  pending  if  the  taxpayer
      withdraws from such litigation prior to the granting of amnesty.
        d.  No  refund or credit shall be granted of any penalty paid prior to
      the  time  the  taxpayer  makes  a  request  for  amnesty  pursuant   to
      subdivision b of this section.
        e.  Unless  the  commissioner  of  finance  on  his  or her own motion
      redetermines the amount of designated taxes plus interest, no refund  or
      credit shall be granted of any designated taxes plus interest paid under
      this amnesty program.
        f.  The  commissioner  of  finance  shall  formulate such rules as are
      necessary, issue forms and instructions, and  take  any  and  all  other
      actions  necessary  to  implement  the  provisions  of this section. The
      commissioner of finance shall publicize the amnesty program provided for
      herein so as to maximize public awareness of and participation  in  such
      program.
    
        g. For purposes of this section, the term "taxpayer" shall include any
      person  liable for payment of any tax specified in subdivision a of this
      section.
        h.  For  purposes  of  this  section, the amnesty tax return forms and
      other documents filed  by  taxpayers  for  purposes  of  chapter  seven,
      eleven,  twenty-one  or  twenty-five of this title shall be deemed to be
      reports or returns referred to in section 11-716,  11-1116,  11-2115  or
      11-2516, respectively, of this title.

Section 11-127 ::    
        
     
        §  11-127 Temporary amnesty program; chapters five, six, seven, eight,
      nine,  eleven,  twelve,   thirteen,   fourteen,   fifteen,   twenty-one,
      twenty-four,   twenty-five   and   twenty-seven   of   this   title.  a.
      Notwithstanding  any  other  provision  of  law  to  the  contrary,  the
      commissioner  of  finance shall establish a three-month amnesty program,
      to be effective during the fiscal year of the city beginning July first,
      two thousand three for taxpayers owing  taxes  or  charges  imposed,  or
      formerly  imposed  by  the above enumerated chapters of this title. Such
      amnesty program shall apply  to  tax  liabilities  for  taxable  periods
      ending,  or  transactions occurring, on or before December thirty-first,
      two thousand one. Amnesty applications and tax return forms shall be  in
      a  form  prescribed by the commissioner of finance and shall provide for
      specifications by the taxpayer of the tax and taxable period or  taxable
      event  for which amnesty is being sought. The taxpayer must also provide
      such additional information  as  is  required  by  the  commissioner  of
      finance.  Amnesty  shall  be  granted only for liabilities for taxes and
      charges imposed or formerly imposed under the  above  chapters  for  the
      taxable  periods  or  taxable  events  specified by the taxpayer on such
      forms (hereinafter referred to as "designated taxes").
        b. Such amnesty program shall provide that upon written application by
      the taxpayer, and upon evidence of payment to the city of  New  York  by
      such  taxpayer  of  all  designated  taxes  plus interest as provided in
      subdivision c of this section, the commissioner of finance  shall  waive
      any penalties that may be applicable. Such commissioner shall also waive
      any  amount  of interest that would be applicable in the absence of this
      amnesty program in excess of the amount required to be paid pursuant  to
      subdivision  c  of  this  section.  No civil, administrative or criminal
      action or proceeding shall be brought against the taxpayer  relating  to
      the  designated  taxes  plus  interest required by this amnesty program.
      Failure to pay all designated  taxes  plus  interest  required  by  this
      amnesty  program  shall  invalidate any amnesty granted pursuant to this
      program.
        c. The interest that is required to be paid under this amnesty program
      shall be, for each designated tax, the excess of:
        (1) interest calculated as provided  by  this  code  to  the  date  of
      payment over
        (2)  interest, if any, calculated as provided by this code to the date
      three years prior to the first day of the amnesty program established by
      the commissioner of finance under this section.
        d. If a taxpayer received any benefit either under the amnesty program
      established by section 11-125 of this chapter, or  the  amnesty  program
      established  by  section eighty-four of chapter seven hundred sixty-five
      of the laws of nineteen hundred eighty-five, with respect to a liability
      for any tax or charge, such taxpayer shall not be eligible  for  amnesty
      under the program established by this section for any liability for that
      same tax or charge for the same or any other tax period.
        e.  Amnesty  shall  not be granted to a taxpayer who is the subject of
      any criminal investigation being conducted by an agency of the  city  of
      New  York or the state of New York or any political subdivision thereof;
      or to any taxpayer who is a party to any  criminal  litigation  that  is
      pending  on  the date of the taxpayer's amnesty application in any court
      of this state or the United States, for nonpayment, delinquency or fraud
      in relation to any of the designated taxes. Amnesty shall  also  not  be
      granted to any taxpayer that has been convicted of a crime relating to a
      designated  tax.  Amnesty  shall  not  be  granted  to any taxpayer with
      respect to liabilities for taxes or  charges  to  the  extent  that  the
      taxpayer's  liability  for  such  taxes or charges was the subject of an
      audit pending with the city of New York department of finance  on  March
    
      tenth,  two thousand three. Amnesty shall not be available to a taxpayer
      for any liability for a designated tax, penalty or interest that is  the
      subject  of  an  existing  installment payment agreement on the day this
      amnesty  program  begins. Amnesty shall be available to any taxpayer who
      is a party to an administrative proceeding or civil litigation commenced
      in the city of New York department of finance conciliation  bureau,  the
      tax  appeals tribunal or any court of this state and pending on the date
      of the taxpayer's amnesty application with respect to a matter  that  is
      the  subject  of  such  proceeding  or litigation, provided the taxpayer
      withdraws from such proceeding or litigation prior to  the  granting  of
      amnesty  and the proceeding or litigation does not involve a matter that
      was the subject of an audit pending with the city of New York department
      of finance on March tenth, two thousand three.
        f. No refund or credit  shall  be  granted  under  this  program  with
      respect  to  any penalty or interest paid prior to the time the taxpayer
      makes a request for amnesty pursuant to subdivision b of this section.
        g. Unless the commissioner  of  finance  on  his  or  her  own  motion
      redetermines  the amount of any designated taxes plus required interest,
      no refund or credit shall be granted of any designated taxes or required
      interest paid under this amnesty program.
        h. Any return or report filed under this amnesty program is subject to
      audit verification  and  assessment  as  provided  by  statute.  If  the
      applicant  files a false or fraudulent tax return or report, or attempts
      in any manner to defeat or  evade  a  tax  under  the  amnesty  program,
      amnesty  shall  be  denied  or  rescinded.  The  waiver of penalties and
      interest and the prohibition of civil and criminal proceedings  provided
      for  in  subdivision  b of this section, apply only with regard to those
      designated taxes, interest and penalties for which amnesty was  granted.
      Nothing  in  this section shall prevent the commissioner of finance from
      determining a higher amount of tax due than that for which  amnesty  was
      granted, provided, however, that such determination shall not invalidate
      the amnesty that was granted for any designated taxes and interest, paid
      pursuant  to this provision. Penalties may be imposed, interest will not
      be waived and proceedings will not be barred with respect to any amounts
      of tax later determined to be due in excess of the designated taxes  for
      which amnesty was granted.
        i.  The  commissioner  of  finance  shall  formulate such rules as are
      necessary, issue forms and instructions  and  take  any  and  all  other
      actions  necessary  to  implement  the  provisions  of this section. The
      commissioner of finance shall publicize the amnesty program provided  in
      this  section so as to maximize public awareness of and participation in
      such program.
        j. For purposes of this section, the term  "eligible  taxpayer"  shall
      include any person liable for payment or collection of any tax or charge
      specified in subdivision a of this section.
        k.  The  amnesty forms and other documents filed by taxpayers pursuant
      to this section for purposes of the chapters of this title  referred  to
      in  subdivision  a  of  this  section  shall be deemed to be reports and
      returns subject to the secrecy provisions of such chapters in  the  same
      manner  and  to  the  same  extent  as  if such forms and documents were
      reports or returns referred to therein.
        l. (1) Notwithstanding any other provision  of  this  section  to  the
      contrary,  the  commissioner  of  finance  may  establish  a three-month
      amnesty program to be effective during  the  fiscal  year  of  the  city
      beginning  July  first,  two thousand three, which may coincide with the
      amnesty program established under subdivision a of this section, for all
      operators of hotels having fewer  than  ten  rooms,  including  but  not
      limited  to  bed  and  breakfast  establishments  and hotels operated in
    
      private residences. Such amnesty program shall  apply  with  respect  to
      liabilities  for  hotel  room  occupancy  tax  on hotel room occupancies
      occurring prior to the day the amnesty program  established  under  this
      subdivision  begins.  Except as provided in this subdivision, all of the
      provisions  of  this  section  shall  apply  to  the   amnesty   program
      established under this subdivision.
        (2) In addition to the other requirements of this section, an operator
      seeking  amnesty  pursuant  to this subdivision must register as a hotel
      operator if such person has not already  done  so.  An  amnesty  program
      established under this subdivision shall provide that upon submission of
      such  written  application  and  upon evidence of payment to the city of
      hotel room occupancy taxes and interest as provided in  paragraph  three
      of  this  subdivision:  (1)  the commissioner of finance shall waive any
      applicable penalties, and no civil administrative or criminal action  or
      proceeding  shall  be  brought against such operator with respect to the
      taxes so paid, and (2) the  commissioner  of  finance  shall  waive  any
      liability  of  such  operator for taxes required to be collected by such
      operator, and interest thereon, for hotel  room  occupancies  in  hotels
      having  fewer  than  ten  rooms,  including  but  not limited to bed and
      breakfast establishments and hotels operated  in  a  private  residence,
      occurring  prior  to  the  first  day of the twelfth month preceding the
      first day of the amnesty program established under this subdivision.
        (3) To be eligible for amnesty under  this  subdivision,  an  operator
      shall  be  required  to  pay  hotel  room  occupancy taxes, and interest
      thereon, that such operator was required to collect for all  hotel  room
      occupancies  in  hotels  having  fewer than ten rooms, including but not
      limited to bed and breakfast establishments and  hotels  operated  in  a
      private  residence,  occurring during the period commencing on the first
      day of the twelfth month preceding the first day of the amnesty  program
      established under this subdivision.
        (4)  Failure  to  pay  all taxes as provided in this subdivision shall
      invalidate any amnesty granted pursuant to this subdivision.
        (5) Notwithstanding any provision of subdivision e of this section  to
      the  contrary,  amnesty  under  this  subdivision  may be granted to any
      taxpayer who has an audit pending with the city of New  York  department
      of  finance on the date of the taxpayer's amnesty application and to any
      taxpayer who is  a  party  to  an  administrative  proceeding  or  civil
      litigation  commenced  in  the  city  of  New York department of finance
      conciliation bureau, the tax appeals tribunal or any court of this state
      and pending on the date of the taxpayer's amnesty application,  provided
      the  taxpayer  withdraws from such proceeding or litigation prior to the
      granting of amnesty.

        b.  Authority.  Notwithstanding  any provision of law to the contrary,
      the department of finance may accept and, as authorized by this section,
      require payment of real property taxes by electronic funds transfer, and
      may authorize a designee to accept  such  payments.  The  department  of
      finance, or its designee, may take all actions necessary to complete and
      administer  such  transactions,  including but not limited to requesting
      and collecting necessary  information  and  the  debiting  of  specified
      accounts as provided for by this section.
        c.   Participation.  Notwithstanding  any  provision  of  law  to  the
      contrary, the commissioner may require  the  payment  of  real  property
      taxes  by  electronic  funds  transfer  for  properties with annual real
      property tax liability equal to or greater than three  hundred  thousand
      dollars.  The  owner  of any such real property, or the person or entity
      authorized by such owner  to  pay  real  property  taxes  on  such  real
      property,  shall  be required to enroll in an electronic payment program
      to make such payments, including any arrears in real property  taxes  on
      such  real  property,  by  electronic  funds transfer, either by payment
      initiated by the taxpayer as described in paragraph one of subdivision d
      of this section or by authorizing the department of finance to debit the
      relevant account as described in paragraph two of subdivision d of  this
      section.
        1.  Notwithstanding  any  other  provision  of  this  section, where a
      taxpayer pays real property taxes for more than one property by a single
      payment, and the total annual  real  property  tax  liability  for  such
      properties  is  equal to or greater than three hundred thousand dollars,
      the total annual real property tax liability for such  properties  shall
      be  used  to  determine whether the taxes for a property must be paid by
      electronic funds transfer.
        2. (i) Where real property taxes are paid for more than  one  taxpayer
      by  a  single bill or paid by a single entity, including but not limited
      to a mortgage escrow agent as  defined  in  subparagraph  (ii)  of  this
      paragraph,  if  the  total amount paid is equal to or greater than three
      hundred  thousand  dollars  annually,  such  amount  shall  be  used  to
      determine  whether  the taxpayer or entity is required to participate in
      an electronic funds transfer program.
        (ii) For purposes of this paragraph, the term "mortgage escrow  agent"
      shall  include every banking organization, federal savings bank, federal
      savings and loan association, federal credit union, bank, trust company,
      licensed mortgage banker, savings bank, savings  and  loan  association,
      credit  union,  insurance  corporation  organized  under the laws of any
      state other than New York, or any other person, entity  or  organization
      which,  in  the  regular  course of its business, requires, maintains or
      services escrow accounts in connection with mortgages on  real  property
      located in the city.
        d.  Electronic  payment  program. The owner of real property, or other
      person or entity authorized by such owner to pay real property taxes  on
      real  property  for  which  payment  must  be  made  by electronic funds
      transfer under this section,  may  choose  between  participating  in  a
      taxpayer initiated payment program or an automatic debit program, as set
      forth  in  this  subdivision  and  described in rules promulgated by the
      commissioner of finance.
    
        1. Taxpayer initiated program. In such a program,  taxpayers  initiate
      payment by electric funds transfer, including payment by fedwire.
        2. Automatic debit program. In such a program, taxpayers authorize the
      department of finance, or the department's designee as determined by the
      commissioner of finance, to debit the taxpayer's account for the amounts
      due.
        e.  Notification  of  participation  requirements.  For  taxpayers  or
      entities subject to this section, the department of finance  shall  mail
      notice  of such requirement to the property owner or other party who has
      been designated to  receive  real  property  tax  bills  on  an  owner's
      registration  card  filed  by  such owner. Such notice shall include the
      date by which the owner or other party designated by such owner  to  pay
      real  property  taxes  on  the  property  must  enroll in the electronic
      payment program.
        f. Authorization. To administer the payment of real property taxes  by
      electronic  funds  transfer by automatic debit as described in paragraph
      two of subdivision d of this section,  the  department  of  finance  may
      require  that  the  party  responsible  for the payment of real property
      taxes:
        1. execute an electronic funds transfer agreement with the  department
      of  finance  or  its  designee,  on a form approved by the department of
      finance. Such form may be in a format designated  by  the  commissioner,
      including  an  electronic  format.  The agreement shall require that the
      taxpayer authorize the department of finance or its  designee  to  debit
      such  account  on  the last date by which the real property taxes may be
      paid without the accrual of interest in accordance with applicable  law;
      and
        2.  furnish the department of finance or its designee with information
      to enable the department of finance to  complete  the  electronic  funds
      transfer transaction. Such information shall include, but not be limited
      to,  the  name  and  address  of the bank from which an electronic funds
      transfer shall be authorized, the account number from which the  payment
      shall  be  authorized,  the  American  Bankers Association (ABA) routing
      number of the bank where the  taxpayer  maintains  an  account  and  the
      borough,  block and lot of the real property for which such payments are
      authorized.
        g. Timely  payment.  Notwithstanding  any  provision  of  law  to  the
      contrary,  where  real  property  taxes  are  required  to  be  made  by
      electronic funds transfer pursuant to subdivision  c  of  this  section,
      payment  of  real  property  tax  by  electronic funds transfer shall be
      deemed timely and not subject to interest charges if:
        1. for taxpayers enrolled in a taxpayer initiated program pursuant  to
      paragraph  one  of  subdivision  d  of  this  section,  (i) the taxpayer
      properly initiates payment on the last date by which the  real  property
      taxes  may  be  paid  without the accrual of interest in accordance with
      applicable law; and (ii) on the last date by  which  the  real  property
      taxes  may  be  paid  without the accrual of interest in accordance with
      applicable law, such account contains sufficient  funds  to  enable  the
      successful completion of the electronic funds transfer; or
        2.  for  taxpayers  enrolled in an automatic debit program pursuant to
      paragraph two of subdivision d of this section, (i)  the  department  of
      finance  or  its  designee  has  been authorized to debit the taxpayer's
      account on the last date by which the real property taxes  may  be  paid
      without  the accrual of interest in accordance with applicable law; (ii)
      such account is properly identified; and (iii) on the date such  payment
      is  due, such account contains sufficient funds to enable the successful
      completion of the electronic funds transfer.
    
        h. Charge on returned payments. Where the department of finance or its
      designee attempts to debit a taxpayer's  account  pursuant  to  a  valid
      electronic  funds  transfer  agreement  and  is  unable  to successfully
      complete the electronic funds transfer  due  to  insufficient  funds  or
      other  cause  not  attributable  to  the  department  of  finance or its
      designee, in addition to any interest accruing from the late payment  of
      taxes  in  accordance  with applicable law, the same fee that is imposed
      for a dishonored check pursuant to section eighty-five  of  the  general
      municipal  law  shall be imposed on the affected real property, and such
      fee may be collected in the manner provided in such section.
        i. Hardship. If a taxpayer is  unable  to  enroll  in  the  electronic
      payment  program required by subdivision c of this section or subsequent
      to enrollment becomes  unable  to  make  payments  by  electronic  funds
      transfer  as required by this section, the taxpayer may seek a waiver by
      written application to the department of finance  that  sets  forth  the
      reason  for such inability. Such waiver may be granted in the discretion
      of the commissioner of finance, who may consider such criteria as:
        1.  the  hardship,  whether  financial  or   practical,   created   by
      participation  in the electronic funds transfer program for the taxpayer
      seeking the waiver;
        2. the length of time for which the waiver is requested; and
        3. any other factors that the commissioner may deem relevant.
        The commissioner shall issue a determination, in writing,  within  ten
      days of the department of finance's receipt of a waiver request pursuant
      to  this subdivision, but no waiver shall be granted with respect to the
      payment of any installment of real property taxes  that  is  due  within
      thirty days of the date of the request for a waiver.
        j.  Confidentiality.  The  department  of  finance  shall  assure  the
      confidentiality  of  information  supplied  by  taxpayers  in  effecting
      electronic  funds  transfers in accordance with applicable provisions of
      law. The provisions of article six of the public officers law shall  not
      apply  to  any  such  information  furnished by taxpayers subject to the
      requirements of this section.
        k. Failure to pay by electronic funds transfer. 1. With respect to any
      real property as to which real property taxes are required to be paid by
      electronic  funds  transfer  under  this  section,  but  for  which   an
      installment  of  real  property  taxes  is  not paid by electronic funds
      transfer and is paid instead by any other method, including  payment  by
      check,  (i)  with  respect  to the first installment that is paid by any
      other method, including payment by  check,  the  department  of  finance
      shall   mail  a  warning  notice  to  the  taxpayer  setting  forth  the
      requirement to  make  payment  by  electronic  funds  transfer  and  the
      penalties  for failure to do so; and (ii) with respect to each and every
      subsequent installment that is  paid  by  any  other  method,  including
      payment  by  check,  the  department  of  finance shall impose a penalty
      charge in the amount of one percent of the amount of the tax installment
      that was required under this section to  be  paid  by  electronic  funds
      transfer.
        2.  Any  penalty charge imposed under this subdivision shall be a lien
      against the real property for  which  the  taxpayer  failed  to  make  a
      payment  in  the  manner  required  by  this  section,  and shall accrue
      interest at the same rate as is imposed on  a  delinquent  tax  on  real
      property,  to  be  calculated  to  the  date of payment from the date of
      entry. Such lien shall be a tax lien  within  the  meaning  of  sections
      11-319  and 11-401 and may be sold, enforced or foreclosed in the manner
      provided in chapters three and four of this title.
        l. Rules. The commissioner may promulgate rules necessary to implement
      this section.
    
    
    
    
    
    
    

Section 11-129
--------------

Section 11-129 ::    
        
     
        §  11-129  Department of finance statement of account. a. At intervals
      determined by the commissioner of finance,  the  department  of  finance
      shall  send  to  owners  of real property a statement of account for the
      property,  which  shall  represent  a  bill  for  taxes,   charges   and
      assessments,  and  which  shall  include,  in a manner determined by the
      commissioner, a description  of  taxes,  charges  and  assessments  that
      remain  unpaid  on the property, and payments received by the department
      for taxes, charges and  assessments  on  the  property,  and  which  may
      include additional information as the commissioner deems appropriate.
        b.  The  statement of account shall be sent to owners who notified the
      department of a mailing address for such statements, or, if  no  mailing
      address  has  been  so  provided, to the owner of record at the property
      address appearing on the assessment roll.
        c. Notwithstanding subdivision b of this section, in lieu  of  mailing
      the  statement  of  account,  the  department  may send the statement of
      account by electronic  means  to  any  owner  whose  electronic  mailing
      address is known to the department.
    
    
    
    
    
    
    

Section 11-130
--------------

Section 11-130 ::    
        
     
        §  11-130  Financial  institution data match system for tax collection
      purposes. 1. Definitions. As used in this section:
        (a) "Debt" means all liabilities, including unpaid tax, interest,  and
      penalty,  that the commissioner of finance is required by law to collect
      and that have been reduced to judgment by the docketing of  a  city  tax
      warrant in the office of the county clerk of the appropriate county.
        (b)  "Tax  debtor"  means  a natural person or any entity other than a
      natural person named on a city tax warrant and identified thereon  as  a
      judgment debtor.
        (c) "Financial institution" means any financial institution authorized
      or  required to participate in a financial institution data match system
      or program for child support enforcement purposes under federal or state
      law.
        2.  Financial  institution  data  match  system  for  tax   collection
      purposes.    (a) To assist the commissioner of finance in the collection
      of debts,  the  department  of  finance  shall  develop  and  operate  a
      financial  institution  data match system for the purpose of identifying
      and seizing the non-exempt assets of tax debtors as  identified  by  the
      commissioner  of  finance. The commissioner is authorized to designate a
      third party  to  develop  and  operate  this  system.  Any  third  party
      designated  by  the commissioner to develop and operate a financial data
      match system shall  keep  all  information  it  obtains  from  both  the
      department and the financial institution confidential, and any employee,
      agent   or  representative  of  that  third  party  is  prohibited  from
      disclosing that information to anyone other than the department  or  the
      financial institution.
        (b) Each financial institution doing business in the state of New York
      shall,  in  conjunction  with  the  commissioner  or  the commissioner's
      authorized  designee,  develop  and  operate  a  data  match  system  to
      facilitate the identification and seizure of non-exempt financial assets
      of  tax  debtors  identified  by  the commissioner or the commissioner's
      authorized designee. If a financial institution has a data match  system
      developed  or  used to administer the child support enforcement programs
      of this state, and if that system is approved by the commissioner or the
      commissioner's authorized designee, the financial  institution  may  use
      that system to comply with the provisions of this section.
        3.  Each  financial  institution shall provide identifying information
      each calendar quarter to the department of finance for each  tax  debtor
      identified  by  the  department  who or that maintains an account at the
      institution.
        The identifying information  shall  include  the  tax  debtor's  name,
      address,  and  social  security  number or other taxpayer identification
      number, and all account numbers and balances in each account.
        4. A financial institution that complies with this section will not be
      liable under state or city law to  any  person  for  the  disclosure  of
      information   to  the  commissioner  or  the  commissioner's  authorized
      designee, or any other action taken in good faith to  comply  with  this
      section.
        5.   Both  the  financial  institution  furnishing  a  report  to  the
      commissioner  under  this  section  and  the  commissioner's  authorized
      designee  are prohibited from disclosing to the tax debtor that the name
      of  the  tax  debtor  has  been  received  from  or  furnished  to   the
      commissioner, unless authorized in writing by the commissioner to do so.
      A violation of this subdivision will result in the imposition of a civil
      penalty  equal  to  the greater of one thousand dollars or the amount in
      the account of the person to whom  the  disclosure  was  made  for  each
      instance  of  unauthorized disclosure by the financial institution. That
    
      civil penalty can be assessed and collected under this code as  if  that
      penalty were tax.
        6.  A  financial institution may disclose to its depositors or account
      holders that the department of finance  has  the  authority  to  request
      certain identifying information on certain depositors or account holders
      under   the  financial  institution  data  match  system  for  city  tax
      collection purposes.
    
    
    
    
    
    
    

Section 11-131
--------------

Section 11-131 ::    
        
     
        §   11-131   Voluntary   disclosure   and   compliance   program.   a.
      Notwithstanding the provisions of any other law to the  contrary,  there
      is  hereby established a voluntary disclosure and compliance program, as
      described in this section, to be administered by the  commissioner,  for
      all  eligible  taxpayers  as  described  in  this section, owing any tax
      imposed or previously imposed under this title.
        b. For purposes of the voluntary  disclosure  and  compliance  program
      established  under  this section, an eligible taxpayer is an individual,
      partnership, estate,  trust,  corporation,  limited  liability  company,
      joint  stock company, or any other company, trustee, receiver, assignee,
      referee, society, association, business or any other person subject to a
      tax imposed by this title and who meets the following criteria: (1)  the
      taxpayer  is  not  currently  under  audit  by  the  department; (2) the
      taxpayer is one who is  voluntarily  disclosing  a  New  York  city  tax
      liability that the department has not determined, calculated, researched
      or  identified  at  the  time of the disclosure; (3) the taxpayer is not
      currently a party to any criminal investigation being  conducted  by  an
      agency  of  the  state or any political subdivision thereof; and (4) the
      taxpayer is not seeking to disclose participation  in  a  tax  avoidance
      transaction  that  is  a  federal or New York state reportable or listed
      transaction.
        c.  Under  the  voluntary  disclosure  and  compliance  program,  upon
      execution  of  a  voluntary  disclosure  and compliance agreement by the
      eligible taxpayer and the commissioner, the commissioner shall waive any
      applicable penalties for the following: (1) failure to pay any such  tax
      liability;  (2)  failure  to file a return or report with respect to any
      such tax liability; and (3) failure to pay estimated tax.  In  addition,
      no  criminal  action  or proceeding shall be brought against an eligible
      taxpayer relating to the tax liability covered by  the  agreement.  This
      agreement  shall  not  preclude  the  auditing  of  the returns filed to
      determine if those returns were completed in  accordance  with  existing
      law  and  regulation.  Intentional  failure  to  pay all the taxes, plus
      related interest, pursuant to the voluntary  disclosure  and  compliance
      agreement  entered into between the taxpayer and the commissioner, shall
      invalidate any waiver of penalty,  invalidate  the  forbearance  of  any
      administrative or criminal action or proceeding.
        d.  To participate in the voluntary disclosure and compliance program,
      an eligible taxpayer must apply by submitting a disclosure statement  in
      the  form  and  manner  prescribed  by  the commissioner. The disclosure
      statement shall contain all the information the commissioner  reasonably
      deems  necessary  to  effectively administer the program. As long as all
      the requirements of the voluntary disclosure and compliance program  are
      met,  no  application  shall  be  denied solely because the taxpayer has
      admitted that the delinquency was the result of  willful  or  fraudulent
      conduct.    Except  in instances where the taxpayer has failed to comply
      with the terms of a voluntary disclosure and compliance  agreement,  the
      commissioner  shall not use the taxpayer's disclosure as evidence in any
      proceeding brought against the taxpayer or reveal the  contents  of  the
      disclosure  to  any  law  enforcement  or  other  agency.  However,  the
      disclosure of any returns or reports filed under this program  with  the
      secretary of the treasury of the United States, his or her delegates, or
      the  proper  tax  officer of any state or city is permitted as otherwise
      provided for in this title.
        e. (1) If the taxpayer and the tax liability are  eligible  under  the
      voluntary   disclosure  and  compliance  program,  the  commissioner  is
      authorized to enter into a voluntary disclosure and compliance agreement
      with the taxpayer. A voluntary disclosure and compliance agreement  will
      be  in  a  form  to  be established by the commissioner and include such
    
      terms  as  the  commissioner  may  reasonably  require  to  satisfy  the
      taxpayer's disclosed tax obligations and enable and require the taxpayer
      to  comply  with  the applicable provisions of this title in the future.
      The  taxpayer  must  pay  the  tax and the related interest that are the
      subject of the voluntary disclosure and compliance  agreement  when  the
      agreement  is executed or within the time stated on a bill issued to the
      taxpayer by the commissioner. In the event the commissioner is satisfied
      that the taxpayer cannot make immediate full payment  of  the  disclosed
      tax  liability,  the  commissioner may enter into an installment payment
      program with the taxpayer for the payment of the tax and  interest  due.
      The  commissioner  may  require a financial disclosure statement setting
      forth information concerning the taxpayer's current assets, liabilities,
      earnings, and  other  financial  information  before  entering  into  an
      installment  payment  plan  with  the taxpayer. In addition to any other
      information and terms that the commissioner determines are  appropriate,
      the voluntary disclosure and compliance agreement shall provide that, if
      the  taxpayer  complies  with the terms of the compliance agreement, the
      taxpayer will not be subject to any criminal tax prosecution in New York
      city for the conduct disclosed by the taxpayer.
        (2) If the taxpayer intentionally provides false material  information
      or  omits  material  information  in  his  or  her  submissions  to  the
      commissioner, or attempts to intentionally defeat or  evade  a  tax  due
      pursuant  to the agreement executed under this section, or intentionally
      fails to comply  with  the  terms  of  the  compliance  agreement,  such
      agreement shall be deemed rescinded.
        f.  Unless  the commissioner on his or her own motion redetermines the
      amount of tax due, including applicable interest,  no  refund  shall  be
      granted   or  credit  allowed  with  respect  to  any  taxes,  including
      applicable interest, paid  under  this  program.  The  commissioner  may
      promulgate  regulations,  issue forms and instructions, and take any and
      all other actions necessary to implement the provisions of  the  program
      established under this section.
        g.  The  commissioner shall publicize the program provided for in this
      section so as to maximize public awareness of and participation in  such
      program.
        h.  For  purposes  of  this  section, the term "taxpayer" includes any
      person required to collect any of the taxes specified in  subdivision  a
      of this section.
        i. The voluntary disclosure and compliance application, the disclosure
      statement,  the voluntary disclosure and compliance agreement, and other
      documents  filed  by  an  eligible  taxpayer  pursuant  to  the  program
      established  by  this  section are deemed to be reports and returns: (a)
      subject to the secrecy provisions of this title in the same  manner  and
      to  the  same extent as if such documents were referred to in any of the
      secrecy provisions of this title; and (b) for purposes of  the  criminal
      provisions of chapter forty of this title.

      then that preparer will be subject to a penalty  of  fifty  dollars  for
      each  failure  to electronically file an authorized tax document, unless
      it is shown that the failure is due to reasonable cause and not  due  to
      willful  neglect. For purposes of this paragraph, reasonable cause shall
      include,  but  not  be  limited  to,  a  taxpayer's  election   not   to
      electronically file the authorized tax document.
    
        (2)  If a taxpayer is required to electronically pay any tax liability
      or other amount due shown on, or required to be paid with, an authorized
      tax document required to be filed electronically pursuant to subdivision
      b or c of this section, and that taxpayer fails  to  electronically  pay
      one  or  more  of  those  liabilities  or  other  amounts due, then that

      manner  as the tax to which the electronic transaction relates. However,
      if the electronic transaction relates to another matter administered  by
      the  commissioner  of  finance,  then  the  penalty  will  be  assessed,
      collected and paid in the same manner as prescribed by  the  chapter  of
      the code that relates to collection of the general corporation tax.
        f.  Any  provision of the New York city charter or this code requiring
      electronic payment or electronic filing of a tax return is not  affected
