Section 11-1771 ::    
        
     
        ยง  11-1771 Requirement of withholding tax from wages. (a) General. (1)
      Every employer maintaining an office or transacting business within this
      city or state and making payment on and after  January  first,  nineteen
      hundred  seventy-seven of any wages taxable under this chapter, or under
      section two of chapter eight hundred eighty-two of the laws of  nineteen
      hundred  seventy-five, as amended by chapter eight hundred eighty-six of
      the laws of nineteen hundred seventy-five,  shall  deduct  and  withhold
      from such wages for each payroll period a tax computed in such manner as
      to  result,  so  far  as practicable, in withholding from the employee's
      wages during each calendar year an amount  substantially  equivalent  to
      the  tax  reasonably  estimated  to  be  due  under this chapter or such
      section two resulting from the inclusion in the employee's city adjusted
      gross income of his or her wages received during such calendar year. The
      method of determining the amount to be withheld shall be  prescribed  by
      regulations  of  the  tax  commission,  with  due  regard  to  the  city
      withholding exemptions of the  employee  and  the  sum  of  any  credits
      allowable  against  his  or  her  tax.  The  section  shall not apply to
      payments by the United States for service in the  armed  forces  of  the
      United  States so long as the right to require deduction and withholding
      of tax from such payments is  prohibited  by  the  laws  of  the  United
      States.  Service in the armed forces of the United States shall have the
      same meaning as when used in a comparable context in  the  laws  of  the
      United States relating to withholding of city income taxes.
        (2) The tax commission may provide, by regulations, for withholding:
        (A) from remuneration for services performed by an employee for his or
      her  employer  which  does  not constitute wages, and (B) from any other
      type of payment, with respect to which the  tax  commission  finds  that
      withholding  would  be appropriate under the provisions of this chapter,
      if the employer and the employee, or in the case of any  other  type  of
      payment the person making and the person receiving the payment, agree to
      such  withholding.  Such agreement shall be made in such form and manner
      as the tax commission may by regulations provide. For purposes  of  this
      chapter,  remuneration  or  other  payments  with  respect to which such
      agreement is made shall be treated as if they  were  wages  paid  by  an
      employer  to an employee to the extent that such remuneration is paid or
      other payments are made during the period for which the agreement is  in
      effect.
        (3)  The  tax  commission shall provide by regulation for an exemption
      from withholding for: (i) employees under eighteen years  of  age,  (ii)
      employees  under twenty-five years of age who are full-time students and
      (iii) employees over sixty-five years of age,  provided  such  employees
      had  no  income  tax  liability  in  the  prior  year and can reasonably
      anticipate none in the current year.
        * (b) Extension  of  withholding  to  certain  periodic  payments  and
      gambling winnings.
        (1)  For purposes of this chapter, any payment subject to withholding,
      within the meaning of  paragraph  two  of  this  subdivision,  shall  be
      treated as if it were wages paid by an employer to an employee.
        (2)  Payments subject to withholding. For purposes of paragraph one of
      this subdivision, a payment subject to withholding means:
        (A) Any supplemental unemployment  compensation  benefit  paid  to  an
      individual  to  the extent includible in such individual's city adjusted
      gross income.
        ** (B) Any member or employee contributions to a retirement system  or
      pension  fund  picked  up  by  the employer pursuant to subdivision f of
      section five hundred seventeen or subdivision d of section  six  hundred
      thirteen  of the retirement and social security law or section 13-225.1,
      13-327.1, 13-125.1, 13-125.2 or 13-521.1 of the administrative  code  of
    
      the  city  of  New  York  or subdivision nineteen of section twenty-five
      hundred seventy-five of the education law.
        ** NB Expires per ch. 681/92 ยง 16
        (C)  Any  payment  of  an  annuity  to  an  individual  to  the extent
      includible in such individual's city adjusted gross income,  if  at  the
      time  the  payment  is  made  a  request that such annuity be subject to
      withholding under this chapter is in effect.
        (D) Any payment of winnings from a wager placed in a lottery conducted
      by the division of the lottery, if the proceeds from such  wager  exceed
      five  thousand dollars and such proceeds are payable pursuant to a prize
      claim made by an individual who was a resident of the city at  the  time
      of the selection of the prize winning lottery ticket.
        (F)  Any amount deducted or deferred from an employee's salary under a
      flexible benefits program established pursuant to  section  twenty-three
      of  the  general municipal law or section one thousand two hundred ten-a
      of the public authorities law.

      writing to the person making the annuity payments.
        Such  a  request  may,  notwithstanding  any  provision  of law to the
      contrary, be terminated by furnishing to the person making the  payments
      a  written  statement  of termination. Such a request for withholding or
      statement of termination  shall  take  effect  in  such  manner  as  the
      commissioner of taxation and finance shall prescribe.
        (B)  Withholding  on  lottery  winnings upon change of residence. If a
      payee of lottery winnings subject to the provisions of subparagraph  (D)
      of  paragraph  two  of  this subdivision changes status from resident to
      nonresident, withholding in  accordance  with  such  subparagraph  shall
      constitute other security acceptable to the commissioner of taxation and
      finance  within  the  meaning  of  paragraph  four of subdivision (c) of
      section 11-1754, unless  such  payee  elects,  in  such  manner  as  the
      commissioner  of  taxation  and  finance  shall  prescribe, to apply the
      provisions of paragraph one of such subdivision (c) to the proceeds,  in
      which  case  withholding under this subdivision shall no longer apply to
      such proceeds.
        (C) Proceeds. For purposes of subparagraphs (D) and (E)  of  paragraph
      two  of  this  subdivision, proceeds from a wager shall be determined by
      reducing the amount received by the amount of the wager.
        (D) Taxes withheld at maximum rate. The tax withheld  on  any  payment
      subject to withholding under subparagraph (D) or (E) of paragraph two of
      this  subdivision  shall  be withheld at the highest rate of tax on city
      taxable income, without any allowance for deductions or  exemptions,  in
      effect  under  this chapter for the taxable year in which the payment is
      made.
        (E)  Determination  of  residence.  For  purposes  of   applying   the
      provisions  of  subparagraphs  (D)  and  (E)  of  paragraph  two of this
      subdivision, any payor of proceeds shall determine the residence of  the
      payee of such proceeds in accordance with regulations or instructions of
      the  commissioner of taxation and finance or, in the absence of any such
      regulations or instructions, in accordance with the address of the payee
      required under the provisions of paragraph  six  of  subsection  (q)  of

        * (b)  Extension of withholding to unemployment compensation benefits,
      annuity payments, and lottery winnings.

        (A)  any  supplemental  unemployment  compensation  benefit paid to an
      individual to the extent includible in such individual's  city  adjusted
      gross income,
        (B)  any  payment  of  an  annuity  to  an  individual  to  the extent
      includible in such individual's city adjusted gross income,  if  at  the
      time  the  payment  is  made  a  request that such annuity be subject to
      withholding under this chapter is in effect, and
        (C) any periodic payment (but only where such payment  is  part  of  a
      series  of  payments  extending over a period greater than one year), of
      lottery winnings by the division of the lottery,  if  at  the  time  the
      payment  is  made  a  request  that  such lottery winnings be subject to
      withholding under this chapter is in effect, shall be treated as  if  it
      were  a  payment  of  wages  by an employer to an employee for a payroll
      period.
        (D) any member or employee contributions to  a  retirement  system  or
      pension  fund  picked  up  or  paid  by  the employer for members of the

      prescribed  by  the commissioner of taxation and finance. A request that
      an annuity be subject to withholding may, notwithstanding any  provision
      of law to the contrary, be terminated by furnishing to the person making
      the  payments a written statement of termination. A request that lottery
      winnings be subject to withholding  under  this  chapter  shall  not  be
      revocable  while  the payee is a nonresident, and shall constitute other
      security  acceptable  to  the  tax  commission  within  the  meaning  of
      paragraph  four  of  subdivision (c) of section 11-1754 of this chapter.
      Such a request for withholding or statement of  termination  shall  take

        ยง 11-1773 Credit for tax withheld. Wages upon which tax is required to
      be  withheld  shall  be  taxable under this chapter as if no withholding
      were required, but any amount of  tax  actually  deducted  and  withheld
      under  this  chapter  in  any calendar year shall be deemed to have been
      paid to the tax commission on behalf of the person from  whom  withheld,
      and  such  person  shall be credited with having paid that amount of tax

Section 11-1774 ::    
        
     
        ยง  11-1774  Employer's  return  and  payment  of  withheld  taxes. (a)
      General.  Every employer required to deduct and withhold tax under  this
      chapter  shall  file  a  withholding  return  and  pay  over  to the tax
      commission or to a depository designated  by  the  tax  commission,  the
      taxes so required to be deducted and withheld, as hereafter prescribed.
        (1)  If, after having made a payroll, an employer has been required to
      deduct and withhold, but has  not  paid  over,  a  cumulative  aggregate
      amount  of  seven  hundred  dollars  or  more  of  tax during a calendar
      quarter, such employer shall file a return and pay over the tax.  If  an
      employer  was  required  to  remit a cumulative aggregate amount of less
      than fifteen thousand dollars in withholding  tax  during  the  calendar
      year  which  precedes  the previous calendar year, the tax shall be paid
      over on or before the fifth business day following the  date  of  making
      such  a  payroll.  If  an  employer  was  required to remit a cumulative
      aggregate amount more than or  equal  to  fifteen  thousand  dollars  in
      withholding  tax  during  the  calendar year which precedes the previous
      calendar year, the tax shall  be  paid  over  on  or  before  the  third
      business day following the date of making such a payroll. In the case of
      an  "educational organization" as defined in paragraph two of subsection
      (a) of section nine of the tax  law  or  a  "health  care  provider"  as
      defined  in  paragraph four of subsection (a) of section nine of the tax
      law, the tax shall be paid over on or  before  the  fifth  business  day
      following the date of making such a payroll.
        (2)  If,  at  the  close of any calendar quarter, an employer has been
      required to deduct and withhold, but has not  paid  over,  a  cumulative
      aggregate  amount  of less than seven hundred dollars of tax during such
      calendar quarter,  such  employer  shall  pay  over  the  tax  with  the
      quarterly   combined   withholding,   wage  reporting  and  unemployment
      insurance return required to be filed for such quarter by paragraph four
      of this subdivision, on or before  the  last  date  prescribed  by  such
      paragraph for filing such return.
        (3)  If  an  employer  makes more than one payroll per week, then such
      employer shall determine the applicability of  the  rules  described  in
      paragraphs  one and two of this subdivision measured by the last payroll
      made within the week by such employer; provided, however,  that  in  any
      week in which the end of a quarter occurs between the making of payrolls
      by  an  employer,  any  tax  required  to  be deducted and withheld in a
      payroll or payrolls made during such week prior to or on the end of  the
      quarter  shall  be  paid  over.  If  an employer was required to remit a
      cumulative aggregate amount of less than  fifteen  thousand  dollars  in
      withholding tax during the calendar year preceding the previous calendar
      year,  the  tax  shall  be paid over on or before the fifth business day
      following the date of making the last payroll in  such  quarter.  If  an
      employer  was  required to remit a cumulative aggregate amount more than
      or equal to fifteen thousand  dollars  in  withholding  tax  during  the
      calendar  year  preceding  the  previous calendar year, the tax shall be
      paid over on or before the third business  day  following  the  date  of
      making  the last payroll in such quarter. In the case of an "educational
      organization" as defined in paragraph two of subsection (a)  of  section
      nine  of the tax law or a "health care provider" as defined in paragraph
      four of subsection (a) of section nine of the tax law, the tax shall  be
      paid  over  on  or  before  the fifth business day following the date of
      making such a payroll. For purposes of this paragraph, the  term  "week"
      shall mean the period Sunday through Saturday.
        (4)(A)  All employers described in paragraph one of subdivision (a) of
      section 11-1771, including those whose wages paid are not sufficient  to
      require the withholding of tax from the wages of any of their employees,
      all employers required to provide the wage reporting information for the
    
      employees   described   in   subdivision  one  of  section  one  hundred
      seventy-one-a of the tax law, and all employers liable for  unemployment
      insurance  contributions  or  for payments in lieu of such contributions
      pursuant  to  article  eighteen of the labor law, shall file a quarterly
      combined withholding, wage reporting and unemployment  insurance  return
      with  the  department  of  taxation  and finance detailing the preceding
      calendar quarter's withholding tax  transactions,  such  quarter's  wage
      reporting    information,    such   quarter's   unemployment   insurance
      contributions, and such other related information as the commissioner of
      taxation and finance or the commissioner of labor,  as  applicable,  may
      prescribe. In addition, the return covering the last calendar quarter of
      each  year shall also include withholding reconciliation information for
      such calendar year. Such returns shall be filed no later than  the  last
      day  of  the  month  following  the  last  day of each calendar quarter;
      provided, however, that an  employer  may  provide  the  wage  reporting
      information  covering  the  last  calendar quarter of each year, and the
      withholding reconciliation information  for  such  year  no  later  than
      February twenty-eighth of the succeeding year.
        (B)  An  employer shall, at the time prescribed by subparagraph (A) of
      this paragraph for filing  each  quarterly  combined  withholding,  wage
      reporting  and  unemployment  insurance  return,  pay  over, in a single
      remittance,  the  unemployment  insurance  contributions  and  aggregate
      withholding   taxes   required   to  be  paid  over  with  such  return.
      Notwithstanding any provision of law to the contrary, an overpayment  of
      unemployment  insurance  contributions or of aggregate withholding taxes
      made by an  employer  with  the  quarterly  combined  withholding,  wage
      reporting  and  unemployment insurance return for a calendar quarter may
      be only credited by such employer against such employer's liability  for
      unemployment  insurance  contributions  or  aggregate withholding taxes,
      respectively.
        (5) The tax commission may, if it believes such action  necessary  for
      the protection of the revenues, require any employer to make such return
      and pay to it the tax deducted and withheld at any time, or from time to
      time.
        (6)  "Aggregate  amount"  as  used in paragraphs one, two and three of
      this subdivision means the aggregate of the  aggregate  amounts  of  New
      York  state  personal  income tax, city personal income tax on residents
      and city earnings tax on nonresidents  authorized  pursuant  to  article
      two-E of the general city law required to be deducted and withheld.
        (b)  Deposit  in trust for tax commission. Whenever any employer fails
      to collect, truthfully account for, pay over the tax, or make returns of
      the tax as required in this section, the  tax  commission  may  serve  a
      notice  requiring  such  employer  to  collect  the  taxes  which become
      collectible after service of such notice, to deposit  such  taxes  in  a
      bank approved by the tax commission, in a separate account, in trust for
      and payable to the tax commission, and to keep the amount of such tax in
      such account until payment over to the tax commission. Such notice shall
      remain  in  effect  until  a notice of cancellation is served by the tax
      commission.

Section 11-1775 ::    
        
     
        ยง  11-1775  Employer's  liability  for  withheld taxes. Every employer
      required to deduct and withhold tax under this chapter  is  hereby  made
      liable  for  such  tax.  For  purposes of assessment and collection, any
      amount required to be withheld and paid over to the tax commission,  and
      any additions to tax, penalties and interest with respect thereto, shall
      be  considered  the  tax  of  the  employer.  Any amount of tax actually
      deducted and withheld under this chapter shall be held to be  a  special
      fund  in  trust for the tax commission. No employee shall have any right
      of action against his or her employer in respect to any moneys  deducted
      and  withheld  from his or her wages and paid over to the tax commission
      in compliance or in intended compliance with this chapter.

Section 11-1776 ::    
        
     
        ยง  11-1776  Employer's  failure  to  withhold. If an employer fails to
      deduct and withhold tax as required,  and  thereafter  the  tax  against
      which  such  tax  may  be  credited  is  paid, the tax so required to be
      deducted and withheld shall not be collected from the employer, but  the
      employer  shall  not  be  relieved  from  liability  for  any penalties,
      interest, or additions to the tax otherwise  applicable  in  respect  of
      such failure to deduct and withhold.

Section 11-1777 ::    
        
     
        ยง  11-1777  Designation  of  third parties to perform acts required of
      employers. In case a fiduciary, agent, or other person has the  control,
      receipt,  custody,  or  disposal of, or pays the wages of an employee or
      group  of  employees,  employed  by  one  or  more  employers,  the  tax
      commission,  under  regulations  promulgated  by  it,  is  authorized to
      designate such fiduciary, agent, or other person to perform such acts as
      are required of employers under this chapter and as the  tax  commission
      may   specify.  Except  as  may  be  otherwise  prescribed  by  the  tax
      commission, all provisions of law (including  penalties)  applicable  in
      respect  of  an  employer  shall be applicable to a fiduciary, agent, or
      other person so designated but, except as so provided, the employer  for
      whom such fiduciary, agent, or other person acts shall remain subject to
      the  provisions  of  law  (including penalties) applicable in respect of
      employers.
