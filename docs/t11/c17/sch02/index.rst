      income  tax  purposes from the sale or other disposition of the property
      with respect to which such tax was paid.

      tax purposes; such interest income shall include the amount received  as
      dividends  from  a  regulated  investment company, as defined in section

      taxable year, determined without regard to subparagraph (D) of paragraph
      two of subsection (b) of section eight hundred fifty-two of the internal
      revenue code;
        (2)  Interest  or  dividend income on obligations or securities of any
      authority, commission or instrumentality of the  United  States  to  the
      extent  includible  in  gross income for federal income tax purposes but
      exempt from state income taxes under the laws of the United States;
        (3) (i)  Pensions  to  officers  and  employees  of  this  state,  its
      subdivisions  and agencies, to the extent includible in gross income for
      federal income tax purposes;
        (ii) Pensions to officers  and  employees  of  the  United  States  of
      America,  any  territory  or possession or political subdivision of such
      territory of possession, the District of  Columbia,  or  any  agency  or
    
      instrumentality of any one of the foregoing, to the extent includible in
      gross income for federal income tax purposes;
        (3-a)  Pensions  and  annuities  received  by  an  individual  who has
      attained the age of fifty-nine  and  one-half,  not  otherwise  excluded
      pursuant   to  paragraph  three  of  this  subdivision,  to  the  extent
      includible in gross income for federal income tax purposes, but  not  in
      excess   of   twenty  thousand  dollars,  which  are  periodic  payments
      attributable to personal services performed by such individual prior  to
      his  or  her  retirement  from  employment,  which  arise:  (i)  from an
      employer-employee  relationship  or  (ii)  from   contributions   to   a
      retirement  plan  which  are deductible for federal income tax purposes.
      However,  the  term  "pensions  and  annuities"   shall   also   include
      distributions  received  by  an  individual  who has attained the age of
      fifty-nine and one-half from an  individual  retirement  account  or  an
      individual  retirement annuity, as defined in section four hundred eight
      of  the  internal  revenue  code,  and  distributions  received  by   an
      individual  who  has  attained  the  age of fifty-nine and one-half from
      self-employed  individual  and  owner-employee  retirement  plans  which
      qualify  under  section  four  hundred one of the internal revenue code,
      whether or not the payments are periodic in  nature.  Nevertheless,  the
      term   "pensions   and   annuities"  shall  not  include  any  lump  sum
      distribution, as defined  in  subparagraph  (A)  of  paragraph  four  of
      subsection  (e) of section four hundred two of the internal revenue code
      and taxed under section six hundred  three  of  the  tax  law.  Where  a
      husband  and  wife  file  a  joint  city personal income tax return, the
      modification provided for in this paragraph shall be computed as if they
      were filing separate city personal income tax returns. Where  a  payment
      would  otherwise  come  within  the  meaning  of  the term "pensions and
      annuities" as set forth in this paragraph except that such individual is
      deceased, such payment shall, nevertheless, be treated as a  pension  or
      annuity  for  purposes  of this paragraph if such payment is received by
      such individual's beneficiary.
        (3-b) (i) Disability income included in federal gross income,  to  the
      extent that such disability income would have been excluded from federal
      gross income pursuant to the provisions of subsection (d) of section one

      had  such  provisions  continued  in effect for taxable years commencing
      after December thirty-first, nineteen hundred eighty-three as they  were
      in   effect   immediately  prior  to  the  repeal  of  such  subsection.
      Notwithstanding the foregoing, the sum  of  disability  income  excluded
      pursuant  to  this  paragraph,  and  pension and annuity income excluded
      pursuant to paragraph three-a of  this  subdivision,  shall  not  exceed
      twenty thousand dollars.
        (ii) Notwithstanding subdivision (f) of this section, if a husband and
      wife  determine  their  federal  income  tax  on  a joint return but are
      required to determine their city income taxes separately, the amounts of
      exclusion allowed under subparagraph (i)  of  this  paragraph  shall  be
      determined  in  the  same  joint  manner as such amounts would have been
      determined under the provisions of paragraph five of subsection  (d)  of
      section one hundred five of the internal revenue code as such provisions
      were  in  effect immediately prior to the repeal of such subsection, but
      shall be attributed for city income tax purposes to the spouse who would
      have been required to report any such amount as income  if  the  spouses
      had determined their federal income taxes separately.
        (iii)  Where  a  husband and wife file a joint city income tax return,
      the twenty thousand dollar limitation provided in  subparagraph  (i)  of
      this  paragraph  shall  be  applied as if they were filing separate city
      income tax returns.
    
        (3-c) Social security benefits  to  the  extent  includible  in  gross
      income for federal income tax purposes pursuant to section eighty-six of

      property having a higher adjusted basis for New York  state  income  tax
      purposes  than  for  federal  income tax purposes on the last day of the
      last taxable year for which article sixteen of the tax law imposes  tax,
      that does not exceed such difference in basis.
        (5) The amount necessary to prevent the taxation under this chapter of
      any  annuity  or  other  amount  of  income  or  gain which was properly
      included in income or gain and was taxable under article sixteen of  the
      tax  law  to the taxpayer, or to a decedent by reason of whose death the
      taxpayer acquired the right to receive the income or gain, or to a trust
      or estate from which the taxpayer received the income or gain;
        (6) Interest or dividend income on obligations or  securities  to  the
      extent  exempt  from income tax under the laws of this state authorizing
      the issuance of such obligations on securities but includible  in  gross

        (7) The amount of any refund or credit for overpayment of income taxes
      imposed  by  this  city,  any  other  taxing  jurisdiction, or any taxes

      included in gross income for federal income tax purposes.
        (8)  Compensation  received  for active service in the armed forces of
      the United States on or after October first, nineteen hundred sixty-one,

      exceed  one  hundred  dollars  for  each  month  of  the  taxable  year,
      subsequent  to September, nineteen hundred sixty-one, during any part of
      which month the taxpayer was engaged in such service. For  the  purposes
      of  this paragraph, the words "active service in the armed forces of the
      United States" shall mean active duty (other than for training)  in  the
      army, navy (including the marine corps), air force or coast guard of the
      United States as defined in title ten of the United States Code.
        (8-a)  Compensation  and  bonuses  received  for active service in the

        (9) Interest on indebtedness incurred  or  continued  to  purchase  or
      carry  obligations or securities the interest on which is subject to tax
      under this chapter but exempt from federal income  tax,  to  the  extent

      the  sale  of  such  assets.  Provided,  further, this paragraph is only
      applicable to a taxpayer who was the  first  recipient  of  such  assets
      after their recovery and who is a victim of Nazi persecution, as defined
      in P.L. 103-286, or a spouse or a descendant of such victim.

      multiplied  by  a  percentage  of  the excess of the taxpayer's business
      income over its business deductions allocated  to  this  state  for  the
    
      first  year  such  depreciation  is  deducted.  Such percentage shall be

      advertising,   promotions  or  research  in  connection  with  literary,

      of this subdivision, which is used in a business carried on both  within
      and  without  the  state the deduction shall not exceed the expenditures
      multiplied by a percentage of the  excess  of  the  taxpayer's  business
      income  over  its  business  deductions  allocated to this state for the
      first year such expenditures are  deducted.  Such  percentage  shall  be
      determined  by apportionment and allocation under regulations of the tax
      commission, and for the taxable year and all succeeding  taxable  years,
      any  deductions  allowed  for  federal income tax purposes on account of
      such expenditures or on account of depreciation of  the  same  property,
      except to the extent that its basis may be attributable to factors other
      than  such expenditures, shall be added to federal adjusted gross income
      pursuant to paragraph six of subdivision (b) of this section, or in case
      a modification is allowable pursuant to this paragraph for only  a  part
      of such expenditures, on condition that a proportionate part of any such
      deductions  allowed  for federal income tax purposes be added to federal
      adjusted gross income. With respect to property which is used or  to  be
      used  for  research and development only in part, or during only part of
      its useful life, the modification allowable pursuant to  this  paragraph
      shall  be  limited  to a proportionate part of the expenditures relating
      thereto. If a modification shall have  been  allowed  pursuant  to  this
      paragraph  for  all  or  part  of  such expenditures with respect to any
      property, and such property is used for purposes other than research and
      development to a greater extent than originally reported,  the  taxpayer
      shall  report  such  use in his or her return for the first taxable year
      during which it occurs, and the tax commission may recompute the tax for
      the year or years for which such deduction was allowed, and  may  assess
      any  additional  tax  resulting  from such recomputation within the time
      fixed by subdivision (c) of section 11-1783.
        (3) For purposes  of  this  paragraph,  such  modifications  shall  be
      allowed  only  with  respect  to  tangible property which is depreciable

      code,  having  a situs in this state and used in the taxpayer's trade or
      business: (A)  constructed,  reconstructed  or  erected  after  December
      thirty-first, nineteen hundred sixty-three, pursuant to a contract which
      was,  on  or before December thirty-first, nineteen hundred sixty-seven,
      and at all times thereafter, binding on the taxpayer or,  property,  the
      physical  construction,  reconstruction or erection of which began on or
      before December thirty-first,  nineteen  hundred  sixty-seven  or  which
      began  after such date pursuant to an order placed on or before December
      thirty-first, nineteen hundred sixty-seven, and then only  with  respect
      to  that  portion  of  the  basis  thereof  or the expenditures relating
      thereto  which  is   properly   attributable   to   such   construction,
      reconstruction or erection after December thirty-first, nineteen hundred
      sixty-three,  or  (B)  acquired  after  December  thirty-first, nineteen
    
      hundred sixty-three, pursuant to a contract  which  was,  on  or  before

      revenue  code,  if  the original use of such property commenced with the
      taxpayer,  commenced  in  this  state  and  commenced   after   December
      thirty-first,   nineteen   hundred   sixty-three,   or   (C)   acquired,
      constructed,  reconstructed,   or   erected   subsequent   to   December
      thirty-first,   nineteen   hundred  sixty-seven,  if  such  acquisition,
      construction, reconstruction or erection is pursuant to a  plan  of  the
      taxpayer  which was in existence December thirty-first, nineteen hundred
      sixty-seven  and  not  thereafter  substantially  modified,   and   such
      acquisition,  construction,  reconstruction  or  erection  would qualify
      under the rules in paragraph four, five or six  of  subdivision  (h)  of
      section forty-eight of the internal revenue code provided all references
      in  such  paragraphs  four,  five  and  six  to  the dates October nine,
      nineteen hundred sixty-six, and October ten, nineteen hundred sixty-six,
      shall be read as December thirty-first, nineteen hundred sixty-seven.  A
      taxpayer  shall  be  allowed a deduction under clause (A), (B) or (C) of
      this paragraph only if the tangible property shall be delivered  or  the
      construction, reconstruction or erection shall be completed on or before
      December  thirty-first,  nineteen hundred sixty-nine, except in the case
      of tangible property which is acquired,  constructed,  reconstructed  or
      erected  pursuant  to  a  contract  which  was,  on  or  before December
      thirty-first, nineteen hundred sixty-seven, and at all times thereafter,
      binding on the taxpayer. However, for any taxable year beginning  on  or
      after  January first, nineteen hundred sixty-eight, a taxpayer shall not
      be allowed a modification under paragraph one of this  subdivision  with
      respect  to  tangible  personal  property  leased to any other person or
      corporation. For purposes of the preceding  sentence,  any  contract  or
      agreement  to  lease or rent or for a license to use such property shall
      be considered a lease. With respect to property which  a  taxpayer  uses
      for  purposes  other  than leasing for part of a taxable year and leases
      for a part of a taxable year, a modification under paragraph one of this
      subdivision shall be allowed in proportion to the part of the year  such
      property is used by the taxpayer.
        (4)  For  purposes  of  this  paragraph,  such  modifications shall be
      allowed only with respect to  tangible  property  which  is  depreciable
      pursuant  to  section  one  hundred  sixty-seven of the internal revenue

      thirty-first, nineteen hundred sixty-seven, pursuant to a contract which
      was, on or before December thirty-first, nineteen  hundred  sixty-eight,
      and  at  all times thereafter, binding on the taxpayer or, property, the
      physical construction, reconstruction or erection of which began  on  or
      before  December  thirty-first,  nineteen  hundred  sixty-eight or which
      began after such date pursuant to an order placed on or before  December
      thirty-first,  nineteen  hundred sixty-eight, and then only with respect
      to that portion of  the  basis  thereof  or  the  expenditures  relating
      thereto   which   is   properly   attributable   to  such  construction,
      reconstruction or erection after December thirty-first, nineteen hundred
      sixty-three, or  (B)  acquired  after  December  thirty-first,  nineteen
      hundred  sixty-seven,  pursuant  to  a  contract which was, on or before
      December thirty-first, nineteen hundred sixty-eight, and  at  all  times
      thereafter, binding on the taxpayer or pursuant to an order placed on or
    
      before  December thirty-first, nineteen hundred sixty-eight, by purchase
      as defined in section one  hundred  seventy-nine  (d)  of  the  internal
      revenue  code,  if  the original use of such property commenced with the
      taxpayer,   commenced   in  this  state  and  commenced  after  December
      thirty-first,   nineteen   hundred   sixty-seven,   or   (C)   acquired,
      constructed,   reconstructed,   or   erected   subsequent   to  December
      thirty-first,  nineteen  hundred  sixty-eight,  if   such   acquisition,
      construction,  reconstruction  or  erection is pursuant to a plan of the
      taxpayer which was in existence December thirty-first, nineteen  hundred
      sixty-eight,   and  not  thereafter  substantially  modified,  and  such
      acquisition, construction,  reconstruction  or  erection  would  qualify
      under  the  rules  in  paragraph four, five or six of subdivision (h) of
      section forty-eight of the internal revenue code provided all references
      in such paragraphs four,  five  and  six  to  the  dates  October  nine,
      nineteen hundred sixty-six, and October ten, nineteen hundred sixty-six,
      shall  be read as December thirty-first, nineteen hundred sixty-eight. A
      taxpayer shall be allowed a deduction under clause (A), (B)  or  (C)  of
      the  preceding  sentence of this paragraph only if the tangible property
      shall be delivered or the construction, reconstruction or erection shall
      be completed  on  or  before  December  thirty-first,  nineteen  hundred
      seventy,  except  in  the  case  of tangible property which is acquired,
      constructed, reconstructed or erected pursuant to a contract which  was,
      on or before December thirty-first, nineteen hundred sixty-eight, and at
      all  times thereafter binding on the taxpayer. The modification provided
      for in paragraph two of this subdivision  shall  be  allowed  only  with
      respect  to  tangible  property: (A) the construction, reconstruction or
      erection of which is completed  after  December  thirty-first,  nineteen
      hundred  sixty-seven,  and then only with respect to that portion of the
      basis thereof or the expenditures relating  thereto  which  is  properly
      attributable  to  such  construction,  reconstruction  or erection after
      December thirty-first, nineteen hundred  sixty-three,  or  (B)  acquired
      after  December  thirty-first, nineteen hundred sixty-seven, by purchase
      as defined in section one  hundred  seventy-nine  (d)  of  the  internal
      revenue  code,  if  the original use of such property commenced with the
      taxpayer,  commenced  in  this  state  and  commenced   after   December
      thirty-first,   nineteen   hundred  sixty-three.  Provided,  however,  a
      modification under paragraph one of this subdivision  shall  be  allowed
      with  respect  to property described in this paragrpah only on condition
      that such property shall be principally used  by  the  taxpayer  in  the
      production of goods by manufacturing; processing; assemblying; refining;
      mining;  extracting;  farming;  agriculture; horticulture; floriculture;
      viticulture; or  commerical  fishing.  For  purposes  of  the  preceding
      sentence,  manufacturing shall mean the process of working raw materials
      into wares suitable for use or which gives new shapes, new qualities  or
      new   combinations  to  matter  which  already  has  gone  through  some
      artificial process by the use of machinery, tools, appliances and  other
      similar  equipment.  Property  used  in  the  production  of goods shall
      include  machinery,  equipment  or  other  tangible  property  which  is
      principally used in the repair and service of other machinery, equipment
      or  other  tangible property used principally in the production of goods
      and shall include all facilities used in  the  manufacturing  operation,
      including  storage  of  material  to be used in manufacturing and of the
      products that are manufactured. At the option of the taxpayer,  air  and
      water pollution control facilities which qualify for elective deductions
      under  subdivision  (h)  of this section may be treated, for purposes of
      this paragraph, as tangible property principally used in the  production
      of  goods  by  manufacturing;  processing; assembling; refining; mining;
      extracting;   farming;    agriculture;    horticulture;    floriculture;
    
      viticulture;  or  commercial  fishing, in which event, a deduction shall
      not be allowed under such subdivision (h). However, for any taxable year
      beginning on or after January first,  nineteen  hundred  sixty-eight,  a
      taxpayer shall not be allowed a modification under paragraph one of this
      subdivision  with  respect  to  tangible personal property leased to any
      other person or corporation. For purposes of the preceding sentence, any
      contract or agreement to lease or rent or for  a  license  to  use  such
      property  shall  be considered a lease. With respect to property which a
      taxpayer uses for purposes other than leasing for part of a taxable year
      and leases for a part of a taxable year, a modification under  paragraph
      one  of  this  subdivision shall be allowed in proportion to the part of
      the year such property is used by the taxpayer.
        (5) If the modifications allowable for any taxable  year  pursuant  to
      this  subdivision  exceed  the  taxpayer's  city  adjusted gross income,
      determined without the allowance of such modifications, the  excess  may
      be  carried  over  to  the  following  taxable  year or years and may be
      subtracted from federal adjusted gross income for such year or years.
        (6) In any taxable year when property is sold  or  otherwise  disposed
      of,  with  respect  to which a modification has been allowed pursuant to
      paragraph one or two of this subdivision, the  basis  of  such  property
      shall  be  adjusted  to reflect the modifications so allowed, and if the
      basis as so adjusted is lower  than  the  adjusted  basis  of  the  same
      property  for  federal  income  tax  purposes,  there  shall be added to
      federal adjusted gross income the amount of the difference between  such
      adjusted bases.
        (h)  Optional  modification for waste treatment facility expenditures.
      For taxable years commencing prior to January  first,  nineteen  hundred
      eighty-nine,  at  the  election  of  the  taxpayer,  there shall also be
      subtracted from federal  adjusted  gross  income  expenditures  paid  or
      incurred  during  the taxable year for the construction, reconstruction,
      erection or improvement of industrial waste treatment facilities and air
      pollution control facilities.
        (1)(A) The term "industrial waste  treatment  facilities"  shall  mean
      facilities  for  the  treatment,  neutralization,  or  stabilization  of
      industrial waste (as the term "industrial waste" is defined  in  section
      17-0105  of the environmental conservation law) from a point immediately
      preceding the point of such treatment, neutralization  or  stabilization
      to   the   point  of  disposal,  including  the  necessary  pumping  and
      transmitting facilities, but excluding such facilities installed for the
      primary  purpose  of  salvaging  materials  which  are  usable  in   the
      manufacturing process or are marketable.
        (B)  The term "air pollution control facilities" shall mean facilities
      which remove, reduce, or render less noxious  air  contaminants  emitted
      from  an  air  contamination  source (as the terms "air contaminant" and
      "air contamination  source"  are  defined  in  section  19-0107  of  the
      environmental  conservation  law) from a point immediately preceding the
      point of such removal, reduction or rendering to the point of  discharge
      of  air,  meeting emission standards as established by the air pollution
      control board, but excluding such facilities installed for  the  primary
      purpose  of  salvaging  materials  which are usable in the manufacturing
      process or are marketable and excluding those facilities which rely  for
      their   efficacy   on   dilution,  dispersion  or  assimilation  of  air
      contaminants in the ambient air after emission.
        (2) Such modifications shall be allowed only:
        (A) with respect to tangible property which is  depreciable,  pursuant
      to  section one hundred sixty-seven of the internal revenue code, having
      a situs in this state and used in the taxpayer's trade or business,  the
      construction,  reconstruction,  erection or improvement of which, in the
    
      case of industrial waste treatment facilities, is initiated on or  after
      January first, nineteen hundred sixty-five, or which, in the case of air
      pollution  control  facilities,  is initiated on or after January first,
      nineteen hundred sixty-six, and
        (B)  on  condition  that  such  facilities  have been certified by the
      commissioner of environmental conservation  or  his  or  her  designated
      representative, in the same manner as provided for in section 17-0707 or
      19-0309  of  the  environmental  conservation  law,  as  applicable,  as
      complying with the provisions of such  environmental  conservation  law,
      the  state  sanitary code and regulations, permits or orders promulgated
      pursuant thereto, and
        (C) on condition that for the taxable year and all succeeding  taxable
      years,  any  deductions allowed for federal income tax purposes for such
      expenditures or for depreciation or amortization of the  same  property,
      except to the extent that its basis may be attributable to factors other
      than  such  expenditures,  be  added  to  federal  adjusted gross income
      pursuant to paragraph five of subdivision (b) of  this  section,  or  in
      case  a  modification is allowable pursuant to this paragraph for only a
      part of such expenditures, on condition that a proportionate  amount  of
      any  such deductions allowed for federal income tax purposes be added to
      federal adjusted gross income, and
        (D) where the election provided for in subdivision (g) of this section
      has not been exercised in respect to the same property.
        (3)(A) If expenditures in respect to  an  industrial  waste  treatment
      facility  or  an  air  pollution control facility have been allowed as a
      modification as provided herein and if within ten years from the end  of
      the taxable year in which such modification was allowed such property or
      any  part thereof is used for the primary purpose of salvaging materials
      which are usable in the manufacturing process  or  are  marketable,  the
      taxpayer  shall  report  such  change of use in its return for the first
      taxable year  during  which  it  occurs,  and  the  tax  commission  may
      recompute  the tax for the year or years for which such modification was
      allowed,  and  may  assess  any  additional  tax  resulting  from   such
      recomputation  within  the  time fixed by paragraph eight of subdivision
      (c) of section 11-1783.
        (B) If a modification is allowed as herein provided  for  expenditures
      paid  or  incurred  during  any taxable year on the basis of a temporary
      certificate  of  compliance  issued  pursuant   to   the   environmental
      conservation  law,  and  if  the  taxpayer  fails  to obtain a permanent
      certificate of compliance upon completion of the facilities with respect
      to which such temporary  certificate  was  issued,  the  taxpayer  shall
      report such failure in its report for the taxable year during which such
      facilities  are  completed, and the tax commission may recompute the tax
      for the year or years for which such modification was allowed,  and  may
      assess  any  additional tax resulting from such recomputation within the
      time fixed by paragraph eight of subdivision (c) of section 11-1783.
        (C) If a modification is allowed as herein provided  for  expenditures
      paid  or incurred during any taxable year in respect to an air pollution
      control facility on the basis of  a  certificate  of  compliance  issued
      pursuant  to  the  environmental conservation law and the certificate is
      revoked pursuant to section 19-0309 of  the  environmental  conservation
      law,  the tax commission may recompute the tax for the year or years for
      which the facility is not or was not in compliance with  the  applicable
      provisions  of  the  environmental  conservation law, the state sanitary
      code or codes, rules, regulations, permits  or  orders  issued  pursuant
      thereto,  and  for  which a modification was allowed, and may assess any
      additional tax resulting from such recomputation within the  time  fixed
      by paragraph eight of subdivision (c) of section 11-1783.
    
        (4)  In  any  taxable year when property is sold or otherwise disposed
      of, with respect to which a modification has been  allowed  pursuant  to
      this paragraph, such modification shall be disregarded in computing gain
      or  loss,  and the gain or loss on the sale or other disposition of such
      property  shall  be  the  gain  or loss entering into the computation of
      federal adjusted gross income for such taxable year.
        (i) In the case  of  mines,  oil  and  gas  wells  and  other  natural
      deposits, any allowance for percentage depletion pursuant to section six
      hundred  thirteen  or  section  six  hundred  thirteen A of the internal
      revenue code, shall be added to federal adjusted gross income.  However,
      with  respect  to  the  property  as  to  which such addition to federal
      adjusted gross income is required, an allowance for depletion  shall  be
      subtracted  from  federal adjusted gross income in the amount that would
      be deductible under section six hundred  eleven  of  such  code  if  the
      deduction for an allowance for depletion were computed without reference
      to  such section six hundred thirteen or section six hundred thirteen A.
      With  respect  to  the  computation  of  depletion  pursuant   to   this
      subdivision, the basis for such computation shall be the basis for state
      income  tax  purposes  provided  for  in  subsection  (i) of section six
      hundred twelve of the tax law. The portion of any gain from the sale  or
      other  disposition  of  such property having a higher adjusted basis for
      city income tax purposes than for federal income tax purposes, that does
      not exceed such difference in basis, shall be  subtracted  from  federal
      adjusted gross income.
        (j)  Modification  for  nonpublic  school  tuition.  (1)  General.  An
      individual shall be  entitled  to  subtract  from  his  or  her  federal
      adjusted  gross  income  an  amount shown in the table set forth in this
      paragraph for his or her city adjusted  gross  income  for  the  taxable
      year,  computed  without the benefit of this modification, multiplied by
      the number of his or her dependents, not exceeding  three,  attending  a
      nonpublic  school  on  a full-time basis for at least four months during
      the regular school year for the education of such  dependent  in  grades
      one  through  twelve,  provided  such individual is allowed an exemption
      under section 11-1716 for such dependent. Provided,  further,  that  the
      modification  under  this paragraph may be taken only if such individual
      has paid at least fifty dollars for each such dependent  in  tuition  to
      such  nonpublic school for such education of such dependent. No taxpayer
      shall be entitled to the modification provided for in this paragraph  if
      he  or  she  claims  a tuition reimbursement payment pursuant to article
      twelve-A of the education law.
     
             If city adjusted                  The amount allowable
             gross income is:                 for each dependent is:

             19,000 -- 20,999                          150
             21,000 -- 22,999                          125

      gross  income  of a husband and wife for purposes of the table set forth
      in paragraph one of this subdivision, the city adjusted gross income  of
    
      a  husband  and wife shall be the aggregate of their city adjusted gross
      incomes for the taxable year, determined  without  the  benefit  of  the
      modification  provided  for  in  this  subdivision,  and  the  number of
      dependents  with respect to which this modification may be claimed shall
      be no more than three in the aggregate.

      three  of  paragraph (a) of subdivision three of section two hundred ten
      of the tax law and, in addition, in the case of a partnership, excluding
      partners) are principally employed in this  state  during  each  taxable
      period,   or   part   thereof,  as  required  by  clause  (iv)  of  this
      subparagraph, and
        (iv) within ninety days after adoption of such plan, or, if  a  return
      is  required,  as  part of such return, under such article nine, article
      nine-a or article twenty-three, whichever is sooner, shall  file  a  new
      business  certificate  with  the  tax commission attesting to whether it
      meets, if subject to taxation under such articles, or intends  to  meet,
      if not so subject, all of the conditions stated in clauses (i), (ii) and
      (iii)   of   this  subparagraph  within  the  time  set  forth  therein.
      Thereafter, during the first four taxable years of  such  new  business,
      along  with,  and  as  part of, any return required under such articles,
      such new business shall make and file a new business certificate for the
      period covered by such return  attesting  to  whether  it  has  met  the
    
      conditions  specified  in  this  subparagraph  during the taxable period
      covered by such return. If no return is required  under  such  articles,
      such  certificate shall be filed annually on or before the fifteenth day
      of  March which shall cover the twelve consecutive calendar month period
      ending on the last day of  December  immediately  preceding  such  March
      fifteenth.  If such new business fails to meet such conditions specified
      in this subparagraph, it shall, in addition, give notice of  this  fact,
      within  the time prescribed by the tax commission, to the holders of its
      "new business investments." The tax commission shall prescribe the  form
      and  content  of  such  new business certification and may require a new
      business to file such certificate for periods  (even  if  no  return  is
      filed or required, but for this section) covering up to eight years from
      the  date  of  adoption of such plan, as in its discretion, it deems the
      same necessary for the enforcement of this section, and
        (v) Special rules:
        (1) For any taxable period, in order to constitute a new  business,  a
      business  enterprise  must  have  derived more than sixty percent of its
      aggregate gross receipts  from  sources  other  than  royalties,  rents,
      dividends,  interest,  annuities  and  sales  or  exchanges  of stock or
      securities.
        (2) A new business does not include: (i) any  new  business  of  which
      twenty-five  percent  or  more  of  the  number  of shares of stock that
      entitle the holders thereof to vote for the  election  of  directors  or
      trustees  is owned, directly or indirectly, by a taxpayer subject to tax
      under section one hundred eighty-three,  one  hundred  eighty-four,  one
      hundred eighty-five or one hundred eighty-six of article nine of the tax
      law,  or under article nine-a, thirty-two or thirty-three of the tax law
      or (ii) any new business  substantially  similar  in  operation  and  in
      ownership,  directly  or  indirectly, to a business entity (or entities)
      taxable, or  previously  taxable,  under  such  section,  such  article,
      article  twenty-three of the tax law or which would have been subject to
      tax under such article twenty-three (as such article was  in  effect  on
      January  first,  nineteen  hundred  eighty) or the income (or losses) of
      which is (or was) includible under article twenty-two of  such  tax  law
      whereby the intent and purpose of this section would be evaded.
        (C)  "New  business  investment"  means  and  includes  the  following
      investments issued before January first, nineteen  hundred  eighty-eight
      by  a  new  business  pursuant  to  a  plan  described  in clause (i) of
      subparagraph (B) of this paragraph for money or  other  property  (other
      than  stock  or  securities)  on  or  before the expiration of the third
      taxable  year  of  such  new  business  (excluding  any   short   period
      immediately preceding such taxable year because the new business was not
      in  existence  for  an entire taxable year) or forty-two months from the
      adoption of such  plan,  whichever  is  sooner:  (i)  original  issuance
      capital  stock  as  part  of  a  new issue, (ii) other original issuance
      securities of a new issue of a like nature as stocks which are  designed
      as  a  means  of  investment  and  issued  for  the purpose of financing
      corporate enterprises and providing for a distribution of rights in such
      enterprises, (iii) debt obligations such as bonds and debentures  for  a
      term  of  at  least  one  year,  whether  secured or unsecured, and (iv)
      certificates and other instruments representing  proprietary  interests,
      whether  limited or otherwise, in and assumption of general liabilities,
      whether limited or otherwise, of a partnership enterprise.
        2. A taxpayer may subtract from his federal adjusted  gross  income  a
      portion  of  an  amount  constituting a new business investment gain, as
      follows:
     
                                    The modification is equal to the
    
                                    following proportion of the gain
      If new business               includible in federal
      investment held for:          adjusted gross income:
      At least four years, but
        less than five years        twenty-five percent
      At least five years, but
        less than six years         fifty percent
      At least six years            one hundred percent
     
        3.  Where,  within  six  months  of  the realization of a new business
      investment gain allowable as the basis of a modification under paragraph
      two of this subdivision, such modification is equal  to  less  than  one
      hundred  percent  of  the  portion  of  the  gain  includible in federal
      adjusted  gross  income  and  the  taxpayer  purchases  a  new  business
      investment  which  is then held for a period of at least six months, the
      taxpayer may subtract from his or her federal adjusted gross income  ten
      percent  (but  not  an  amount that will reduce the portion of such gain
      included in his or her New York income below zero) of the amount of such
      gain where the purchase price of the new business investment is equal to
      or greater than the proceeds of the sale giving rise to such gain. Where
      the purchase price of the new business investment is less than an amount
      equal to the proceeds of such sale,  the  modification  allowable  under
      this  paragraph  shall be equal to ten percent of an amount equal to the
      product of: (A) the amount of the gain and (B) a fraction the  numerator
      of which is the purchase price of the new investment and the denominator
      of  which  is  an  amount  equal  to  the  proceeds  of  such  sale. The
      modification allowable under this paragraph  may  be  utilized,  at  the
      option  of  the  taxpayer, with respect to the taxable year in which the
      new business investment gain is realized or the year containing the last
      day of the six-month retention period described in this paragraph.
        4. The tax commission may prescribe such rules and regulations as  may
      be necessary to carry out the purposes of this subdivision.
        (p)  New  business  investment  deferral.  For taxable years beginning
      before January first, nineteen hundred eighty-eight, at  the  option  of
      the taxpayer, there may be subtracted from federal adjusted gross income
      a reinvested amount of long-term capital gain realized in a taxable year
      from  the  sale  of  a capital asset, as such term is defined in section
      twelve hundred twenty-one of the internal revenue code, which is  not  a
      new  business  investment. A reinvested amount of long-term capital gain
      shall mean an amount which bears the same ratio to the long-term capital
      gain realized from the sale of a capital asset which was  includible  in
      New  York  adjusted  gross  income  as that portion of the sale proceeds
      which is reinvested, within one year from date of sale, in  a  New  York
      new  business bears to the total sale proceeds. For the purposes of this
      subdivision, a New York new business is a business enterprise which: (1)
      has been a taxpayer under  article  nine-A,  twenty-two,  thirty-two  or
      thirty-three  of  the  tax  law  for  no  more  than three taxable years
      (including short taxable years), (2) over fifty percent of the number of
      shares of stock that  entitle  the  holders  thereof  to  vote  for  the
      election  of directors or trustees is not owned, directly or indirectly,
      by a taxpayer subject to tax under section one hundred eighty-three, one
      hundred eighty-four, one hundred eighty-five or one  hundred  eighty-six
      of  article  nine of the tax law, or under article nine-A, thirty-two or
      thirty-three of the  tax  law,  (3)  is  not  substantially  similar  in
      operation or ownership, directly or indirectly, to a business entity (or
      entities)  taxable,  or  previously  taxable,  under such sections, such
      articles, article twenty-three of the tax law or which would  have  been
      subject to tax under article twenty-three (as such article was in effect
    
      on  January first, nineteen hundred eighty) or the income (or losses) of
      which is (or was) includible under article twenty-two  of  the  tax  law
      whereby  the intent and purpose of this subdivision would be evaded, (4)
      locates  and employs at least ninety percent of its assets in the state,
      (5) employs principally in the state eighty percent of its employees (as
      ascertained within the meaning  and  intent  of  subparagraph  three  of
      paragraph (a) of subdivision three of section two hundred ten of the tax
      law and, in addition, in the case of a partnership, excluding partners),
      and  (6)  derives  less  than  forty  percent  of  its gross income from
      dividends,  interest,  royalties  (other  than  mineral,  oil,  or   gas
      royalties  or  copyright  royalties), annuities and (7) reports at least
      twenty-five hundred dollars in gross income in  any  taxable  year.  The
      reinvested amount must qualify as a capital asset as defined pursuant to
      section  twelve hundred twenty-one of the internal revenue code and must
      be retained by the taxpayer for at least twelve months. The modification
      allowable under this subdivision shall be utilized with respect  to  the
      taxable year in which the twelve month retention period ends.
        (q)  An amount deferred under subdivision (p) hereof shall be added to
      federal adjusted gross income when the reinvestment in the New York  new
      business which qualified a taxpayer for such deferral is sold.
        (r)  In  the  case of a sale or other disposition of property acquired
      from a decedent and valued  by  the  executor  of  the  estate  of  such
      decedent for the purposes of the tax under article twenty-six of the tax
      law  (i)  pursuant  to  paragraph  two of subsection (b) of section nine
      hundred fifty-four of the tax law, or  (ii)  pursuant  to  section  nine
      hundred  fifty-four-a of the tax law, where such estate was insufficient
      to require the filing  of  a  federal  estate  tax  return,  the  amount
      necessary  to  properly reflect the gain or loss from such sale or other
      disposition which would have been realized under this chapter,  had,  in
      the  case of clause (i) of this subdivision, a federal estate tax return
      been filed similarly valuing  such  property  pursuant  to  section  two
      thousand  thirty-two  of  the  internal  revenue code, or in the case of
      clause (ii) of  this  subdivision,  pursuant  to  section  two  thousand
      thirty-two-A of such code.
        (s)  New  York  S  termination year. (1) General. In the case of a New
      York S termination year, the amount of any item of S corporation income,
      loss and deduction included in the shareholder's federal adjusted  gross
      income  and any reductions for taxes (as described in paragraphs two and
      three of subsection (f) of section thirteen  hundred  sixty-six  of  the
      internal  revenue  code)  shall  be  adjusted  in  accordance  with  the
      treatment provided in paragraph two or three of this subdivision.
        (2) Pro rata allocation. Unless paragraph three  of  this  subdivision
      applies,  an  equal portion of each S corporation item shall be assigned
      to each day of the S corporation's taxable year for federal  income  tax
      purposes.  The portion of each such item thereby assigned to the S short
      year shall be treated as an item of a New York S  corporation,  and  the
      portion  of each such item thereby assigned to the C short year shall be
      treated as  an  item  of  an  S  corporation  which  is  a  New  York  C
      corporation.
        (3)  Normal  tax  accounting.  The  portion of each S corporation item
      assigned to the S short year and the C short year  shall  be  determined
      using normal tax accounting rules if:
        (A)  there is a sale or exchange of fifty percent or more of the stock
      in such corporation during the New York S termination year or
        (B) the corporation so elects, as  provided  in  subparagraph  (B)  of
      paragraph two of subsection (s) of section six hundred twelve of the tax
      law.
    
        (t)  Related  members  expense  add back. (1) Definitions. (A) Related
      member.  "Related  member"  means  a  related  person  as   defined   in
      subparagraph  (c)  of  paragraph three of subsection (b) of section four
      hundred sixty-five of the internal  revenue  code,  except  that  "fifty
      percent" shall be substituted for "ten percent".
        (B)  Effective  rate  of tax. "Effective rate of tax" means, as to any
      city, the maximum statutory rate of  tax  imposed  by  the  city  on  or
      measured   by   a   related   member's  net  income  multiplied  by  the
      apportionment percentage, if any, applicable to the related member under
      the laws of said jurisdiction. For  purposes  of  this  definition,  the
      effective  rate of tax as to any city is zero where the related member's
      net income tax liability in said city  is  reported  on  a  combined  or
      consolidated  return  including both the taxpayer and the related member
      where the reported transactions between the  taxpayer  and  the  related
      member  are eliminated or offset. Also, for purposes of this definition,
      when computing the effective rate of tax for a city in which  a  related
      member's  net  income  is  eliminated  or  offset by a credit or similar
      adjustment that is dependent upon the related member either  maintaining
      or  managing  intangible  property or collecting interest income in that
      city, the maximum statutory rate of tax imposed by said  city  shall  be
      decreased  to  reflect  the  statutory  rate  of tax that applies to the
      related  member  as  effectively  reduced  by  such  credit  or  similar
      adjustment.
        (C) Royalty payments. Royalty payments are payments directly connected
      to  the  acquisition,  use,  maintenance or management, ownership, sale,
      exchange, or any other disposition of licenses, trademarks,  copyrights,
      trade  names,  trade  dress,  service  marks, mask works, trade secrets,
      patents and any other similar types of intangible assets  as  determined
      by  the  state commissioner of taxation and finance, and include amounts
      allowable as interest deductions under section one  hundred  sixty-three
      of  the internal revenue code to the extent such amounts are directly or
      indirectly for, related to or in connection with the  acquisition,  use,
      maintenance  or  management, ownership, sale, exchange or disposition of
      such intangible assets.
        (D) Valid business purpose. A valid business purpose is  one  or  more
      business  purposes,  other  than the avoidance or reduction of taxation,
      which alone or in combination constitute the primary motivation for some
      business activity or transaction, which activity or transaction  changes
      in  a  meaningful  way, apart from tax effects, the economic position of
      the taxpayer. The economic position of the taxpayer includes an increase
      in the market share of the taxpayer, or the entry by the  taxpayer  into
      new business markets.
        (2)  Royalty  expense add backs. (A) For the purpose of computing city
      adjusted gross  income,  a  taxpayer  must  add  back  royalty  payments
      directly or indirectly paid, accrued, or incurred in connection with one
      or more direct or indirect transactions with one or more related members
      during  the taxable year to the extent deductible in calculating federal
      taxable income.
        (B) Exceptions. (i) The adjustment required in this subdivision  shall
      not  apply  to  the  portion  of  the  royalty payment that the taxpayer
      establishes, by clear and convincing evidence of the  type  and  in  the
      form  specified  by  the  commissioner  of  finance,  meets  all  of the
      following requirements: (I) the related member was  subject  to  tax  in
      this  city  or another city within the United States or a foreign nation
      or some combination thereof on a tax  base  that  included  the  royalty
      payment  paid,  accrued  or  incurred  by the taxpayer; (II) the related
      member during the same taxable year directly or indirectly paid, accrued
      or incurred such portion to a person that is not a related  member;  and
    
      (III)  the  transaction  giving  rise to the royalty payment between the
      taxpayer and the related member was  undertaken  for  a  valid  business
      purpose.
        (ii)  The  adjustment  required in this subdivision shall not apply if
      the taxpayer establishes, by clear and convincing evidence of  the  type
      and  in the form specified by the commissioner of finance, that: (I) the
      related member was subject to tax on or measured by its  net  income  in
      this  city or another city within the United States, or some combination
      thereof; (II) the tax base for said tax  included  the  royalty  payment
      paid,  accrued  or  incurred  by  the  taxpayer; and (III) the aggregate
      effective  rate  of  tax  applied  to  the  related  member   in   those
      jurisdictions  is  no  less than eighty percent of the statutory rate of
      tax that applied to the taxpayer under section 11-1701 of  this  chapter
      for the taxable year.
        (iii)  The  adjustment required in this subdivision shall not apply if
      the taxpayer establishes, by clear and convincing evidence of  the  type
      and  in the form specified by the commissioner of finance, that: (I) the
      royalty payment was paid,  accrued  or  incurred  to  a  related  member
      organized under the laws of a country other than the United States; (II)
      the  related  member's  income  from  the  transaction  was subject to a
      comprehensive income tax treaty between  such  country  and  the  United
      States;  (III) the related member was subject to tax in a foreign nation
      on a tax base  that  included  the  royalty  payment  paid,  accrued  or
      incurred  by  the  taxpayer;  (IV)  the related member's income from the
      transaction was taxed in such country at an effective  rate  of  tax  at
      least  equal  to  that imposed by this city; and (V) the royalty payment
      was paid, accrued  or  incurred  pursuant  to  a  transaction  that  was
      undertaken  for a valid business purpose and using terms that reflect an
      arm's length relationship.
        (iv) The adjustment required in this subdivision shall  not  apply  if
      the  taxpayer  and  the  commissioner of finance agree in writing to the
      application or use  of  alternative  adjustments  or  computations.  The
      commissioner  of  finance  may,  in  his or her discretion, agree to the
      application or use of alternative adjustments or computations when he or
      she concludes that in the absence of such agreement the  income  of  the
      taxpayer would not be properly reflected.

        ยง  11-1715  City itemized deduction of a city resident individual. (a)
      General. If federal taxable income of  a  city  resident  individual  is
      determined  by  itemizing  deductions  from  his  federal adjusted gross
      income, such resident individual may elect to deduct his  city  itemized
      deduction  in  lieu  of  his  city standard deduction. The city itemized
      deduction of a city resident individual means the total  amount  of  his
      deductions  from  federal  adjusted  gross  income,  other  than federal
      deductions for personal exemptions, as  provided  in  the  laws  of  the
      United  States for the taxable year, with the modifications specified in
      this section, except as provided for under subdivisions (f) and  (g)  of
      this section.
        (b) Husband and wife.
        (1)  A  husband  and  wife,  both of whom are required to file returns
      under this chapter, shall be allowed city itemized  deductions  only  if
      both elect to take city itemized deductions.
        (2)  The  total  of the city itemized deductions of a husband and wife
      whose federal taxable income is determined on a joint return, but  whose
      city  taxable incomes are required to be determined separately, shall be
      divided between them as  if  their  federal  taxable  incomes  had  been
      determined separately.
        (c)  Modifications  reducing  federal  itemized  deductions. The total
      amount of deductions from federal adjusted gross income shall be reduced
      by the amount of such federal deductions for:
        (1) state and local general sales taxes as defined in  subsection  (b)
      of  section  one hundred sixty-four of the internal revenue code, to the
      extent included in federal itemized deductions or income  taxes  imposed

      taxes on nonresidents that are imposed upon and paid  by  taxpayers  for
      taxable  years  beginning  after December thirty-first, nineteen hundred
      seventy  and  before  January  first,  two  thousand,  pursuant  to  the
      authority  of  former  section twenty-five-m of the general city law, to
      the extent that the amount of such tax exceeds the tax  computed  as  if
      the  rates  were  one-fourth  of one percent of wages subject to tax and
      three-eighths of  one  percent  of  net  earnings  from  self-employment
      subject to tax;
        (2)  interest  on  indebtedness  incurred  or continued to purchase or
      carry obligations or securities the interest on which is exempt from tax
      under this chapter; and
        (3) ordinary and  necessary  expenses  paid  or  incurred  during  the
      taxable  year  for:  (i) the production or collection of income which is
      exempt from tax under this chapter, or (ii) the management, conservation
      or maintenance of property held for the production of such  income,  and
      the  amortizable  bond  premium  for  the  taxable  year on any bond the
      interest on which is exempt from tax under this chapter, to  the  extent
      that  such  expenses  and premiums are deductible in determining federal
      taxable income.
        (4) premiums paid for long-term care insurance to the extent that such
      premiums are deductible in determining federal taxable income.
        (6) in the case of a shareholder of an S corporation:
        (A) where the election provided for in subsection (a) of  section  six
      hundred  sixty  of the tax law has not been made, S corporation items of
      deduction included in federal itemized deductions, and
        (B) in the case of a New York S termination year, the portion of  such
      items assigned to the period beginning on the day the election ceases to
      be effective, as determined under subdivision (s) of section 11-1712.
        (d)  Modifications  increasing  federal itemized deductions. The total
      amount of  deductions  from  federal  adjusted  gross  income  shall  be
      increased by:
    
        (1) (Reserved.)
        (2)  interest  on  indebtedness  incurred  or continued to purchase or
      carry obligations or securities the interest on which is subject to  tax
      under  this  chapter  but  exempt from federal income tax, to the extent
      that such interest on indebtedness is not deductible for federal  income
      tax  purposes  and  is not subtracted from federal adjusted gross income
      pursuant to paragraph nine of subdivision (c) of section 11-1712; and
        (3) ordinary and  necessary  expenses  paid  or  incurred  during  the
      taxable  year  for:  (i) the production or collection of income which is
      subject to tax under this chapter but exempt from federal income tax, or
      (ii) the management, conservation or maintenance of  property  held  for
      the  production of such income, and the amortizable bond premium for the
      taxable year on any bond the interest on which is subject to  tax  under
      this chapter but exempt from federal income tax, to the extent that such
      expenses and premiums are not deductible in determining federal adjusted
      gross  income  and are not subtracted from federal adjusted gross income
      pursuant to paragraph ten of subdivision (c) of section 11-1712.
        (4) allowable college tuition expenses, as defined in paragraph two of
      subsection (t) of section six hundred six of the tax law, multiplied  by
      the   applicable   percentage.   Such  applicable  percentage  shall  be
      twenty-five percent for taxable years beginning  in  two  thousand  one,
      fifty   percent  for  taxable  years  beginning  in  two  thousand  two,
      seventy-five percent for taxable years beginning in two  thousand  three
      and  one  hundred percent for taxable years beginning after two thousand

      partner  or  by  a  shareholder  of  an  S  corporation (other than an S
      corporation which is a New York C corporation), with respect to items of
      deduction of a partnership or S corporation shall  be  determined  under
      section 11-1717.
        (2)  Shareholders of S corporations which are New York C corporations.
      In the case of a shareholder of an S corporation which is a New  York  C
      corporation,  the  modifications  under this section which relate to the
      corporation's items  of  deduction  shall  not  apply,  except  for  the
      modification provided under paragraph six of subdivision (c).

      and the denominator of which is fifty thousand dollars.

      For taxable years beginning after nineteen hundred eighty-seven, a  city
      resident  individual  shall  be allowed a city exemption of one thousand
      dollars for  each  exemption  for  which  such  resident  individual  is
      entitled  to  a  deduction  for the taxable year under subsection (c) of
      section one hundred fifty-one of the  internal  revenue  code;  and  for

      each  exemption  for which he is entitled to a deduction for the taxable
      year for federal income tax purposes.
        (b) Husband and wife. If the city income taxes of a husband  and  wife
      are required to be separately determined but their federal income tax is
      determined  on a joint return, each of them shall be separately entitled
      to the city exemptions under subdivision (a) of this  section  to  which
      each  would be separately entitled for the taxable year if their federal
      income taxes had been determined on separate returns.

      gross  income  and  city  taxable income of a city resident partner or a
      city  resident  shareholder  of  an  S  corporation  (other  than  an  S
      corporation  which  is  a  New  York  C  corporation),  any modification
      described in  subdivision  (b),  (c)  or  (d)  of  section  11-1712,  or
      subdivision  (c)  of  section  11-1715  or  paragraph  two  or  three of
      subdivision (d) of such section, which relates to an item of partnership
      or S corporation income, gain,  loss  or  deduction  shall  be  made  in
      accordance  with  the  partner's distributive share or the shareholder's
      pro rata share, for federal income tax purposes, of the  item  to  which
      the  modification  relates.  Where  a  partner's distributive share or a
      shareholder's pro rata share of any such item  is  not  required  to  be
      taken  into  account  separately  for  federal  income tax purposes, the
      partner's or shareholder's share of such item  shall  be  determined  in
      accordance  with  his  or her share, for federal income tax purposes, of
      partnership or S corporation taxable income or loss  generally.  In  the
      case  of a New York S termination year, his or her pro rata share of any
      such item shall be determined under subdivision (s) of section 11-1712.
        (b) Character of items. Each item of  partnership  and  S  corporation
      income,  gain,  loss,  or  deduction shall have the same character for a
      partner or shareholder under this subchapter as for federal  income  tax
      purposes.  Where  an  item  is  not characterized for federal income tax
      purposes, it shall have the same character for a partner or  shareholder
      as  if  realized  directly  from  the  source from which realized by the
      partnership or S corporation or incurred in the same manner as  incurred
      by the partnership or S corporation.
        (c)  City  tax  avoidance  or  evasion. Where a partner's distributive
      share of an item of partnership  income,  gain,  loss  or  deduction  is
      determined  for  federal income tax purposes by special provision in the
      partnership agreement with respect to such item, and where the principal
      purpose of such provision is the avoidance or evasion of tax under  this
      chapter,  the  partner's  distributive  share  of  such  item,  and  any
      modification required with respect thereto, shall be  determined  as  if
      the partnership agreement made no special provision with respect to such
      item.

      purposes. Provided however, such individual's city adjusted gross income
      shall include his or her distributive or pro rata share of the allocated
      entire net income as determined by such business under sections  fifteen
      hundred three and fifteen hundred four of the tax law. In the event such
      allocated  entire  net  income  is a loss, there shall not be subtracted

      the  applicable  specific deduction described in subdivision (c) of this
      section plus the tax described in paragraph two above, the amount of any
      net operating loss of the taxpayer, as determined for federal income tax
      purposes,  which  remains  as  a  net  operating  loss  carryover  to  a
      succeeding  taxable  year. In such case, however, the amount of such net
      operating loss used to reduce the sum of the  items  of  tax  preference
      shall  be  treated  as  an item of tax preference in the next succeeding
      taxable years, in order of  time,  in  which  such  net  operating  loss
      carryover reduces federal taxable income.
        (b)  For  purposes of this chapter, the term "items of tax preference"
      shall mean the federal items of tax preference, as  defined  in  section
      fifty-seven of the internal revenue code, of a city resident individual,
      estate  or  trust  (but only to the extent apportioned to such estate or
      trust under such code), as the case may be, for the taxable  year,  with
      the modifications specified in this subdivision and adjusted as provided
      for in subdivision (e) of this section.
        (1)  The  federal  items  of  tax preference with respect to depletion
      shall be excluded from the computation of items of tax preference.
        (2) Except with respect to recovery property subject to the provisions
      of section two  hundred  eighty-F  of  the  internal  revenue  code  and
      recovery  property  placed  in  service  in  this state in taxable years
      beginning after December thirty-first, nineteen hundred eighty-four, the
      federal item of tax preference with  respect  to  the  accelerated  cost
      recovery  deduction  shall  be excluded from the computation of items of
      tax preference.
        (3) In the case of  a  shareholder  of  an  S  corporation  where  the
      election  provided for in subsection (a) of section six hundred sixty of
      the tax law has not been made with  respect  to  such  corporation,  the
      federal  items  of  tax  preference of the corporation shall be excluded
      from the computation of items of tax preference.
        (4) The federal item of tax preference  with  respect  to  tax  exempt
      interest  shall  be  excluded  from  the  computation  of  items  of tax
      preference.
        (c) Specific deduction.
        (1) City resident individuals. Five thousand dollars  for  individuals
      or  married persons filing joint returns and twenty-five hundred dollars
      for married individuals filing separate returns.
        (2) City resident estates or trusts. An amount,  not  to  exceed  five
      thousand dollars, which bears the same ratio to five thousand dollars as
      the  items  of  tax  preference  of  such estate or trust computed under
      subdivision (b) of this section bear to the sum  of  the  items  of  tax
      preference of such estate or trust computed under the laws of the United
      States  for  the  taxable year, with the modifications described in such
      subdivision (b), but without regard to any apportionment of the items of
      tax preference between  such  estate  or  trust  and  the  beneficiaries
      thereof under such laws of the United States.
    
        (d)  Disallowance  of  credits.  The  credits  against  tax under this
      chapter, except for the credit  under  section  11-1773,  shall  not  be
      allowed as a credit against the tax imposed by section 11-1702.
        (e)  The  items  of tax preference determined under subdivision (b) of
      this section shall be adjusted where the tax treatment  giving  rise  to
      such  items  will  not  result  in  the  reduction of the taxpayer's tax
      determined under section six hundred one of the tax law for any  taxable
      year.
