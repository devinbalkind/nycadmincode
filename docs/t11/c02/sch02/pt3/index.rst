        ยง 11-249 Functions, powers and duties of the board; annual designation
      of exemption areas and restricted commercial uses. a. The members of the
      board shall have the following functions, powers and duties:
        1.  to receive and review applications for certificates of eligibility
      pursuant to the charter and pursuant to subdivision thirteen of  section
      11-604 and subdivision (e) of section 11-503 of this title;
        2.  to  make  findings  and  determinations  on  the qualifications of
      applicants for certificates of eligibility pursuant  to  this  part  and
      pursuant  to  subdivision thirteen of section 11-658 and subdivision (e)
      of section 11-503 of this title;
        3. to issue certificates of eligibility and amendments thereto;
        4. to make recommendations to the tax commission on the termination of
      a tax exemption pursuant to section 11-253 of this part;
        5. to designate annually, pursuant to subdivision b of  this  section,
      areas  in which exemptions for commercial construction or reconstruction
      shall be granted as of right, areas from which such exemptions shall  be
      excluded  and commercial uses for which the granting of exemptions shall
      be restricted; and
        6. to make and promulgate rules  and  regulations  to  carry  out  the
      purposes of the board.
        b.  (1)  Not  later  than  October  first of each year the board shall
      publish a notice at least once in the official paper or a  newspaper  of
      general  circulation  in  the  city  setting  forth:  (i)  the  proposed
      boundaries of areas in which commercial construction  or  reconstruction
      shall  be  granted  exemptions as of right, proposed boundaries of areas
      from which exemptions  for  commercial  construction  or  reconstruction
      shall  be excluded and proposed restricted commercial uses; and (ii) the
      date, not earlier than ten nor later  than  thirty  days  following  the
      publication  of  such  notice,  on  which  the  board will hold a public
      hearing to hear all  persons  interested  in  the  designation  of  such
      boundaries and restricted commercial uses.
        (2)  Not  earlier  than  ten  nor later than thirty days following the
      conclusion of the public hearing provided for in paragraph one  of  this
      subdivision,  the board shall designate the boundaries of areas in which
      exemptions  for  commercial  construction  or  reconstruction  shall  be
      granted  as  of  right  and  areas  from  which such exemptions shall be
      excluded and shall  also  designate  restricted  commercial  uses.  Such
      designations shall be made upon the following determinations:
        (i)   With   respect  to  areas  in  which  exemption  for  commercial
      construction or reconstruction shall be granted as of right,  the  board
      shall  determine  that  market  conditions  in  each  area are such that
      exemptions  are  required  to   attract   commercial   construction   or
      reconstruction  to  the  area  and  that attracting such construction or
      reconstruction, and the granting of  exemptions  therefor,  are  in  the
      public  interest.  In making such determination, the board may consider,
      among other factors, that the area is experiencing economic distress  or
      is  characterized by an unusually large number of vacant, underutilized,
      unsuitable  or  substandard  structures,  or   by   other   substandard,
      unsanitary,  deteriorated  or  deteriorating conditions, with or without
      tangible blight, or that commercial development  in  the  area  will  be
      beneficial to the city's economy.
        (ii)  With  respect  to  areas  from  which  exemptions for commercial
      construction or reconstruction are  to  be  excluded,  the  board  shall
      determine  that  market conditions in each area are such that exemptions
      are not required to attract commercial construction or reconstruction to
      the area, or that it is not in the public interest to  grant  exemptions
      for   commercial   construction   or  reconstruction  in  the  area.  No
    
      applications   for   exemptions   for   commercial    construction    or
      reconstruction shall be accepted from such areas.
        (iii)  With  respect  to  restricted  commercial uses, the board shall
      determine that it is not in the public interest to grant exemptions  for
      such  uses  unless  the  board  further determines that in certain areas
      designated  pursuant  to  this  subdivision,  such  uses  will  have  an
      especially  positive  impact on the area's economy. All applications for
      exemptions for restricted commercial uses shall be  determined  pursuant
      to  paragraphs  two and three of subdivision b of section 11-251 of this
      part.
        (3) Designations made pursuant to this subdivision shall be  effective
      on the first day of January of each year.
        c. So far as practicable and subject to the approval of the mayor, the
      services  of  all  other  city  departments  and  agencies shall be made
      available by their respective heads to the board for the carrying out of
      the functions stated in this part. The head of any department or  agency
      shall furnish information in the possession of such department or agency
      when the board, after consultation with the mayor, so requests.

      assessed   value  of  the  property  at  the  time  an  application  for
      certificate of eligibility pursuant to this part is made,  or  (ii)  the

      plans   approved   in  the  certificate  of  eligibility  including  any
      amendments thereto, taxes shall be  due  and  payable  retroactively  as
      otherwise required by law.
        c.    In  all cases where the board shall have issued a certificate of
      eligibility prior to January first,  nineteen  hundred  eighty-two,  the
      exemption  percentage  shall  apply  to  any  subsequent increase in the

      preliminary  approval pursuant to section 11-251 of this part, which are
      administered under the local emergency housing  rent  control  act,  the
      rent  stabilization  law of nineteen hundred sixty-nine or the emergency
      tenant protection act of nineteen seventy-four, unless a certificate  of
      eviction  has  been  issued  for  any of the displaced or replaced units
      pursuant to the powers granted by the city rent and rehabilitation law.
        f.  The provisions of this part shall not apply to  an  applicant  who

      application   for   a   certificate  of  eligibility,  receives  written
      permission to commence from the board or its  designated  representative
      prior  to  the  granting of a certificate of eligibility.  Demolition of
      existing structures, site preparation limited  to  grading,  filling  or
      clearing,  or  the  curing  of  a safety or sanitary hazard shall not be
      deemed to be commencement of construction or reconstruction work.

      the  board  shall  be  ineligible  for  any subsequent or additional tax
      exemption pursuant to the provisions of this part until  the  expiration

      such  determination,  the  board shall make findings that the commercial
      services to be provided will have an especially positive impact  on  the
      area's  or  the  city's  economy and that the applicant has demonstrated
      that the project cannot go forward without the greater exemption granted
      by such designation.

      of  eligibility  is  to  be  considered shall be open to the public, and

        d.  The burden of proof shall be on the applicant to show by clear and
      convincing evidence that the requirements for granting a  tax  exemption
      pursuant  to this part have been satisfied, and the board shall have the
      authority to require  that  statements  made  in  consideration  of  the
      application be taken under oath.
    
        e.  After  the  issuance of a certificate of eligibility the applicant
      shall apply to the city tax commission, during the  period  provided  by
      law  for filing applications for corrections of assessed valuations, for
      a tax exemption as provided for in section  11-250  of  this  part.  The
