Section 11-269 ::    
        
     
        ยง  11-269  Industrial  and  commercial real property tax abatement. a.
      Subject to the provisions of this part, tax abatement benefits shall  be
      available  to  eligible  recipients in accordance with the provisions of
      this section.
        b. Amount of abatement base. (1) Calculation of abatement base. Except
      as provided in paragraph (5) of  subdivision  c  of  this  section,  the
      abatement  base  used  to determine the amount of the abatement provided
      under this part shall be the amount by which the post-completion tax  on
      a  building  or  structure  exceeds  one  hundred fifteen percent of the
      initial tax levied on a building or structure.
        (2) Initial tax on building or structure. (a) Determination of initial
      tax. The initial tax  shall  be  determined  by  multiplying  the  final
      taxable  assessed  value, without regard to any exemptions, shown on the
      assessment roll with a taxable status  date  immediately  preceding  the
      issuance  of  the  first  building  permit  by the initial tax rate. For
      purposes of this subdivision, the initial tax rate shall  be  the  final
      tax  rate  applicable  to the assessment roll with a taxable status date
      immediately preceding the issuance of the first building permit.  If  no
      permit  was  required, the initial tax and the initial tax rate shall be
      determined based on the assessment  roll  with  a  taxable  status  date
      immediately preceding the commencement of construction.
        (b)  Effect  of  tax lot apportionment or merger. For a property as to
      which an applicant has applied for benefits pursuant to  this  part,  if
      such  property is apportioned or merged and such apportionment or merger
      is not reflected in the assessment roll described in subparagraph (a) of
      this paragraph, the initial tax for the newly created tax  lot  or  lots
      shall  be  based  on  the initial tax of the lot or lots from which they
      have been created, which shall be apportioned among  the  newly  created
      tax lot or lots in the manner established by the department for purposes
      of assessed valuation of real property.
        (3)  Post-completion  tax  on  building  or structure. For purposes of
      calculating  the  abatement  base  only,  the  post-completion  tax   is
      determined  by  multiplying  the  initial  tax rate by the final taxable
      assessed value, without regard to any exemptions, that would be shown on
      the assessment roll but for the abatement, on the assessment roll with a
      taxable status date immediately following the earlier of:
        (a) completion of construction; or
        (b) four years from the date of issuance of the first building permit,
      or if no permit was required, the commencement of construction.
        (4) (a) If the taxable assessed value is  later  reduced  by  a  court
      order  or application to the tax commission, then the initial tax or the
      post-completion tax shall be the tax as reduced.
        (b) The taxable assessed value  used  for  the  calculations  in  this
      subdivision  shall  be the lower of the actual and transitional value as
      provided in subdivision three of section eighteen hundred five  of  this
      chapter.
        (5)  Mixed-use property. For a mixed-use property, the initial tax and
      post-completion tax shall be apportioned  between  the  residential  and
      nonresidential   portions.   The  department  may  promulgate  rules  to
      determine the method of apportionment.
        (6) Initial taxes not to be reduced by abatement. Except  as  provided
      in  paragraph  (5)  of  subdivision  c  of  this  section, the abatement
      provided under this part shall not be applicable  in  any  year  of  the
      benefit  period  to  the initial tax or to the tax on the portion of the
      assessment attributable to land. Additionally, the abatement  shall  not
      result in any credit or refund of real property taxes.
        c.  Industrial and commercial abatements. (1) Abatement for commercial
      construction  work.  Upon  approval  by  the  department  of   a   final
    
      application  for  benefits,  an  applicant  who has performed commercial
      construction work outside of a special  commercial  abatement  area,  as
      designated  pursuant to subdivision b of section 11-274 of this part, or
      a renovation area, as defined by subdivision c of section 11-274 of this
      part,  shall  be  eligible  for  an abatement of real property taxes, as
      follows:
        (a) Amount of abatement. The first year of the abatement shall be  the
      tax  year  with the first taxable status date that follows the sooner of
      (i) completion of construction; or (ii) four years  from  the  date  the
      first  building  permit  was  issued,  or if no permit was required, the
      commencement  of  construction.  For  years  one  through  eleven,   the
      abatement  shall  be  the amount of the abatement base. For years twelve
      through fifteen, the abatement shall decrease  by  twenty  percent  each
      year. The following table illustrates the abatement computation:
                Tax year during benefit period:    Amount of abatement:
                Years 1 through 11                 100% of abatement base
                12                                 80% of abatement base
                13                                 60% of abatement base
                14                                 40% of abatement base
                15                                 20% of abatement base
        (b)  Minimum  required  expenditure. For commercial construction work,
      the minimum required expenditure is thirty  percent  of  the  property's
      taxable  assessed  value  in  the  tax  year  with a taxable status date
      immediately preceding the issuance of the first building permit,  or  if
      no  permit  was required, the commencement of construction. Expenditures
      for residential construction work or construction work  on  portions  of
      property  to  be used for restricted activities shall not be included in
      the minimum required expenditure.
        (2)  Abatement  for  industrial  construction   work   or   commercial
      construction  work  in  special  commercial abatement areas on buildings
      where not more than ten percent of the building or structure is used for
      retail purposes. Upon approval by the department of a final  application
      for  benefits,  an  applicant  who has performed industrial construction
      work in any area, where not more than ten percent  of  the  building  or
      structure  on  which  such  work  has  been performed is used for retail
      purposes, or  commercial  construction  work  in  a  special  commercial
      abatement  area,  as  designated  pursuant  to  subdivision b of section
      11-274 of this part, where not more than ten percent of the building  or
      structure  on  which  such  work  has  been performed is used for retail
      purposes, shall be eligible for an abatement of real property taxes,  as
      follows:
        (a)  Amount of abatement. The first year of the abatement shall be the
      tax year with the first taxable status date that follows the  sooner  of
      (i)  completion  of  construction;  or (ii) four years from the date the
      first building permit was issued, or if  no  permit  was  required,  the
      commencement  of  construction.  For  years  one  through  sixteen,  the
      abatement shall be the amount of the abatement base. The abatement shall
      be adjusted for inflation protection as provided in subparagraph (b)  of
      this  paragraph.  For years seventeen through twenty-five, the abatement
      shall decrease by ten percent each year. The following table illustrates
      the abatement computation:
                Tax year during benefit period:    Amount of abatement:
                Years 1 through 16                 100% of abatement base
                17                                 90% of abatement base
                18                                 80% of abatement base
                19                                 70% of abatement base
                20                                 60% of abatement base
                21                                 50% of abatement base
    
                22                                 40% of abatement base
                23                                 30% of abatement base
                24                                 20% of abatement base
                25                                 10% of abatement base
        (b) Inflation protection. (i) Industrial construction work. (A) Effect
      of  assessed  valuation increases. For years two through thirteen of the
      benefit period, except as provided in item (B) of this clause, if  there
      is  any  increase  in  tax  in that year that is based on an increase of
      taxable assessed valuation since the immediately prior  tax  year,  such
      excess tax liability shall be added to the amount of the abatement base.
      Such  addition  to  the amount of the abatement base shall be determined
      using the initial tax rate.
        (B) Physical increases. Notwithstanding the provisions of item (A)  of
      this  clause,  if  in  any  of years two through thirteen of the benefit
      period, a physical change to the property results in an increase in  the
      taxable  assessed  value  of  the property of more than five percent for
      that year, then any increase in taxes for that year shall not  be  added
      to the amount of the abatement base in any year.
        (C)  If  the  taxable  assessed  value upon which an adjustment to the
      abatement under this paragraph is based is  later  reduced  by  a  court
      order  or  application  to  the  tax  commission,  then  the appropriate
      adjustment to the abatement base shall be made in  accordance  with  the
      reduced taxable assessed value.
        (i) Commercial construction work in special commercial abatement areas
      on  buildings  where  not  more  than  ten  percent  of  the building or
      structure is used for retail purposes. (A) Effect of assessed  valuation
      increases.  For years two through thirteen of the benefit period, except
      as provided in item (B) of this clause, if there is any increase in  tax
      in  that year that is based on an increase of taxable assessed valuation
      since the immediately prior tax year that  exceeds  five  percent,  such
      excess tax liability shall be added to the amount of the abatement base.
      Such  addition  to  the amount of the abatement base shall be determined
      using the initial tax rate.
        (B) Physical increases. Notwithstanding the provisions of item (A)  of
      this  clause,  if  in  any  of years two through thirteen of the benefit
      period, a physical change to the property results in an increase in  the
      taxable  assessed  value  of  the property of more than five percent for
      that year, then any increase in taxes for that year shall not  be  added
      to the amount of the abatement base in any year.
        (C)  If  the  taxable  assessed  value upon which an adjustment to the
      abatement under this paragraph is based is  later  reduced  by  a  court
      order  or  application  to  the  tax  commission,  then  the appropriate
      adjustment to the abatement base shall be made in  accordance  with  the
      reduced taxable assessed value.
        (ii) Mixed-use property. For a property as to which benefits are given
      for   both   industrial   and  commercial  construction,  the  inflation
      protection provided under  this  subparagraph  shall  be  based  on  the
      predominant use of the property as determined by the department.
        (c)  Minimum required expenditure. For industrial construction work or
      commercial construction work in a special commercial abatement area, the
      minimum required expenditure is thirty percent of the property's taxable
      assessed value in the tax year with a taxable  status  date  immediately
      preceding the issuance of the first building permit, or if no permit was
      required, the commencement of construction. Expenditures for residential
      construction  work  or  construction  work on portions of property to be
      used for restricted activities shall not  be  included  in  the  minimum
      required expenditure.
    
        (2-a)  Abatement  for  industrial construction work on a peaking unit.
      Upon approval by the department of a final application for benefits,  an
      applicant  who has performed industrial construction work in any area on
      a peaking unit, shall be eligible for  an  abatement  of  real  property
      taxes, as follows:
        (a)  Amount of abatement. The first year of the abatement shall be the
      tax year with the first taxable status date that follows the  sooner  of
      (i)  completion  of  construction;  or (ii) four years from the date the
      first building permit was issued, or if  no  permit  was  required,  the
      commencement  of  construction.  For  years  one  through  fifteen,  the
      abatement shall be the amount of the abatement base. The abatement shall
      be adjusted for inflation protection as provided in subparagraph (b)  of
      this   paragraph.   The   following   table  illustrates  the  abatement
      computation:
      Tax year during benefit period:         Amount of abatement:
      Years 1 through 15                      100% of abatement base
        (b) Inflation protection. (i) Industrial construction work, effect  of
      assessed  valuation  increases.  For  years  two through thirteen of the
      benefit period, except as provided in clause (ii) of this  subparagraph,
      if  there  is  any  increase  in  tax  in  that year that is based on an
      increase of taxable assessed valuation since the immediately  prior  tax
      year,  such  excess  tax  liability  shall be added to the amount of the
      abatement base. Such addition to the amount of the abatement base  shall
      be determined using the initial tax rate.
        (ii)  Physical increases. Notwithstanding the provisions of clause (i)
      of this subparagraph, if in any of years two  through  thirteen  of  the
      benefit period, a physical change to the property results in an increase
      in  the taxable assessed value of the property of more than five percent
      for that year, then any increase in taxes for that  year  shall  not  be
      added to the amount of the abatement base in any year.
        (iii)  If  the  taxable assessed value upon which an adjustment to the
      abatement under this paragraph is based is  later  reduced  by  a  court
      order  or  application  to  the  tax  commission,  then  the appropriate
      adjustment to the abatement base shall be made in  accordance  with  the
      reduced taxable assessed value.
        (c)  Minimum required expenditure. For industrial construction work on
      a peaking unit, the minimum required expenditure is  thirty  percent  of
      the  property's  taxable  assessed  value in the tax year with a taxable
      status date immediately preceding the issuance  of  the  first  building
      permit,  or if no permit was required, the commencement of construction.
      Expenditures for residential construction work or construction  work  on
      portions  of  property to be used for restricted activities shall not be
      included in the minimum required expenditure.
        (3)  Abatement  for  industrial  construction   work   or   commercial
      construction  work  in  special  commercial abatement areas on buildings
      where more than ten percent of the building or  structure  is  used  for
      retail  purposes. Upon approval by the department of a final application
      for benefits, an applicant who  has  performed  industrial  construction
      work  in  any  area,  where  more  than  ten  percent of the building or
      structure on which such work has  been  performed  is  used  for  retail
      purposes,  or  commercial  construction  work  in  a  special commercial
      abatement area, as designated  pursuant  to  subdivision  b  of  section
      11-274  of  this  part,  where  more than ten percent of the building or
      structure on which such work has  been  performed  is  used  for  retail
      purposes,  shall  be eligible for an abatement of real property taxes on
      the non-retail portion of such building  or  structure  and  up  to  ten
      percent  of  such  building  or  structure  used for retail purposes, in
      accordance with paragraph (2) of this subdivision, and shall be eligible
    
      for an abatement of real property taxes on the remaining retail  portion
      of such building or structure, as follows:
        (a)  Amount of abatement. The first year of the abatement shall be the
      tax year with the first taxable status date that follows the  sooner  of
      (i)  completion  of  construction;  or (ii) four years from the date the
      first building permit was issued, or if  no  permit  was  required,  the
      commencement   of  construction.  For  years  one  through  eleven,  the
      abatement shall be the amount of the abatement base.  For  years  twelve
      through  fifteen,  the  abatement  shall decrease by twenty percent each
      year. The abatement  shall  be  adjusted  for  inflation  protection  as
      provided  in  subparagraph  (b)  of  this paragraph. The following table
      illustrates the abatement computation:
                Tax year during benefit period:    Amount of abatement:
                Years 1 through 11                 100% of abatement base
                12                                 80% of abatement base
                13                                 60% of abatement base
                14                                 40% of abatement base
                15                                 20% of abatement base
        (b) Inflation protection. (i) Industrial construction work. (A) Effect
      of assessed valuation increases. For years two through thirteen  of  the
      benefit  period, except as provided in item (B) of this clause, if there
      is any increase in tax in that year that is  based  on  an  increase  of
      taxable  assessed  valuation  since the immediately prior tax year, such
      excess tax liability shall be added to the amount of the abatement base.
      Such addition to the amount of the abatement shall be  determined  using
      the initial tax rate.
        (B)  Physical increases. Notwithstanding the provisions of item (A) of
      this clause, if in any of years two  through  thirteen  of  the  benefit
      period,  a physical change to the property results in an increase in the
      taxable assessed value of the property of more  than  five  percent  for
      that  year,  then any increase in taxes for that year shall not be added
      to the amount of the abatement base in any year.
        (C) If the taxable assessed value upon  which  an  adjustment  to  the
      abatement  under  this  paragraph  is  based is later reduced by a court
      order or  application  to  the  tax  commission,  then  the  appropriate
      adjustment  to  the  abatement base shall be made in accordance with the
      reduced taxable assessed value.
        (i) Commercial construction work in special commercial abatement areas
      on buildings where more than ten percent of the building or structure is
      used for retail purposes. (A) Effect of  assessed  valuation  increases.
      For years two through thirteen of the benefit period, except as provided
      in item (B) of this clause, if there is any increase in tax in that year
      that  is  based  on  an increase of taxable assessed valuation since the
      immediately prior tax year that exceeds five percent,  such  excess  tax
      liability  shall  be  added  to  the  amount of the abatement base. Such
      addition to the amount of the abatement base shall be  determined  using
      the initial tax rate.
        (B)  Physical increases. Notwithstanding the provisions of item (A) of
      this clause, if in any of years two  through  thirteen  of  the  benefit
      period,  a physical change to the property results in an increase in the
      taxable assessed value of the property of more  than  five  percent  for
      that  year,  then any increase in taxes for that year shall not be added
      to the amount of the abatement base in any year.
        (C) If the taxable assessed value upon  which  an  adjustment  to  the
      abatement  under  this  paragraph  is  based is later reduced by a court
      order or  application  to  the  tax  commission,  then  the  appropriate
      adjustment  to  the  abatement base shall be made in accordance with the
      reduced taxable assessed value.
    
        (ii) Mixed-use property. For a property as to which benefits are given
      for  both  industrial  and  commercial   construction,   the   inflation
      protection  provided  under  this  subparagraph  shall  be  based on the
      predominant use of the property as determined by the department.
        (c)  Minimum required expenditure. For industrial construction work or
      commercial construction work in a special commercial abatement area, the
      minimum required expenditure is thirty percent of the property's taxable
      assessed value in the tax year with a taxable  status  date  immediately
      preceding the issuance of the first building permit, or if no permit was
      required, the commencement of construction. Expenditures for residential
      construction  work  or  construction  work on portions of property to be
      used for restricted activities shall not  be  included  in  the  minimum
      required expenditure.
        (4)  Abatement  for  renovation construction work in renovation areas.
      Subject to the provisions of subparagraph (c) of  this  paragraph,  upon
      approval  by  the  department  of  a  final application for benefits, an
      applicant who has performed renovation construction work in a renovation
      area, as defined by subdivision c of section 11-274 of this part,  shall
      be eligible for an abatement of real property taxes, as follows:
        (a)   Amount  of  abatement.  For  the  renovation  areas  defined  in
      paragraphs (1) and (2) of subdivision c of section 11-274 of this  part,
      the  first  year  of  the abatement shall be the tax year with the first
      taxable status date  that  follows  the  sooner  of  (i)  completion  of
      construction; or (ii) four years from the date the first building permit
      was   issued,  or  if  no  permit  was  required,  the  commencement  of
      construction. For years one through eight, the abatement  shall  be  the
      amount  of  the  abatement  base.  For  years  nine  through twelve, the
      abatement shall decrease by twenty  percent  each  year.  The  following
      table illustrates the abatement computation:
                Tax year during benefit period:    Amount of abatement:
                Years 1 through 8                  100% of abatement base
                9                                  80% of abatement base
                10                                 60% of abatement base

                12                                 20% of abatement base
        (b)  Amount of abatement. For the renovation area defined in paragraph
      (3) of subdivision c of section 11-274 of this part, the first  year  of
      the  abatement  shall be the tax year with the first taxable status date
      that follows the sooner of (i) completion of construction; or (ii)  four
      years  from  the  date  the  first  building permit was issued, or if no
      permit was required, the commencement of  construction.  For  years  one
      through  five,  the abatement shall be the amount of the abatement base.
      For years six through nine,  the  abatement  shall  decrease  by  twenty
      percent each year. In year ten, the abatement shall be twenty percent of
      the  abatement  base.  The  following  table  illustrates  the abatement
      computation:
                Tax year during benefit period:    Amount of abatement:
                Years 1 through 5                  100% of abatement base
                6                                  80% of abatement base

                10                                 20% of abatement base
        (c) If more than five percent of any building or structure upon  which
      renovation  construction  work is performed is used for retail purposes,
      no abatement shall be granted for the retail portions of  such  building
      or  structure  in  excess  of  five  percent,  but  five percent of such
      building or structure used for retail purposes shall be eligible for  an
    
      abatement  of real property taxes in accordance with subparagraph (a) or
      subparagraph (b) of this paragraph, as  applicable;  provided,  however,
      that  notwithstanding  any other provision of this part, any building or
      structure  located  in  the  renovation area defined in paragraph (1) of
      subdivision c of section 11-274 of this part shall be  eligible  for  an
      abatement   in  accordance  with  subparagraph  (a)  of  this  paragraph
      regardless of the amount of the building or structure  used  for  retail
      purposes.

      permit,  or if no permit was required, the commencement of construction.
      Expenditures for construction work on portions of  the  property  to  be
      used  for  retail  purposes  that exceed five percent of the building or
      structure in renovation areas defined  in  paragraphs  (2)  and  (3)  of
      subdivision   c   of  section  11-274  of  this  part,  for  residential
      construction work, or for construction work on portions of the  property
      to  be  used  for  restricted  activities,  shall not be included in the
      minimum required expenditure.
        (5) Additional industrial abatement. In addition to the abatement  for
      industrial   construction   work  provided  in  paragraph  (2)  of  this
      subdivision, an applicant who performs industrial construction work that

      Expenditures  for  residential construction work or construction work on
      portions of property to be used for restricted activities shall  not  be
      included in the minimum required expenditure.
        (6)  Abatement for commercial construction work on new construction in
      certain areas of the borough of  Manhattan.  Notwithstanding  any  other
      provision of law, upon approval by the department of a final application

      this part, an applicant shall not file a preliminary application for new
      abatement benefits  under  this  part  for  an  additional  construction
      project  on the same portion of the property for which construction work
      is the subject of abatement benefits under this part until at least four
      years have elapsed since the first day of the first  tax  year  of  such
      abatement  benefits  under  the  prior abatement, and, in the event that
      such new benefits are granted, then notwithstanding any other  provision
      of  this  part  or  any  other  law,  the  initial  tax for any such new
      abatement will be determined without regard to the prior  abatement  and
      any other abatement or exemption granted to the property.
        (2)  Abatement  benefits granted under this part shall not in any year
      exceed the real property taxes imposed on such property.
        (3) Once an abatement is granted, no additional benefits  pursuant  to
      this part shall be granted for construction work that is substantively a
      part of eligible construction work for which benefits have been approved
      or granted.
        (4) No benefits shall be granted for residential construction work.
        (5)  Any  parcel partly located in an excluded area shall be deemed to
      be entirely located in such area.

      eligible  and  non-eligible  uses,  the initial tax shall be apportioned
      under  rules  promulgated  by  the  commissioner  and   only   the   tax
      attributable to the eligible portion of the property shall be abated.
        (7)(a)  No benefits under this part may be received by a property that
      is concurrently receiving exemption or abatement of real property  taxes
      under  any  other  law,  except  for an exemption under (i) section four
      hundred twenty-a, four hundred twenty-b or four hundred fifty-nine-b  of
      the  real property tax law; or (ii) any section of the real property tax
      law as to which the city has enacted  a  local  law  to  implement  such
      exemption  and  as to which exemption is granted only if the property is
      the primary or legal residence of one or  more  of  the  owners  of  the
      property,  including  such sections in which exemption may be granted if
      an owner is absent from the residence while receiving medical  benefits;
      or  (iii) title two-D of article four of the real property tax law for a
    
      separate project involving separate parts of the building  or  structure
      that was completed prior to the application for benefits.
        (b) For purposes of this paragraph, "property" means the real property
      contained by an individual tax lot.
        (c)  Notwithstanding  subparagraph  (b)  of  this  paragraph,  where a
      property is owned in condominium form, and an application  for  benefits
      under  this part includes more than one tax lot in the same condominium,
      then for purposes of this paragraph, "property" shall include any or all
      such tax lots that are included in the application.

      building permit, or if no  permit  was  required,  the  commencement  of
      construction.
        (2)  Mixed  use properties. Expenditures for construction work related
      to the common areas and systems of  such  property  shall  be  allocated
      under  rules  promulgated  by  the  department  between the residential,
      nonresidential and retail, if any, portions of the property.
        b.  Time  limit  for  completion  of  construction.  Construction   of
      buildings  or  structures for which benefits have been approved shall be
      completed no later than five years from the  date  of  issuance  of  the
      first building permit, or if no permit was required, the commencement of
      construction.    Failure  to  meet  this  requirement  shall  result  in
      termination of any inflation protection provided under subdivision c  of
      section  11-269  of this part for any tax year that begins following the
      date  by  which  completion  of  construction  is  required  under  this
      paragraph.
        c. Non-permissible uses. To be eligible for benefits, the property may
      not  be  used  for  a non-permissible purpose. Accordingly, no abatement
      benefits under this part shall be granted for work to  be  performed  on
      property to be used for the following purposes:
        (1)  Residential.  No  abatement  benefits  under  this  part shall be
      granted for construction work for residential purposes, or for work on a
      structure or building where twenty percent or more of the total rentable
      square footage of such property is or will be dedicated  to  residential
      purposes,  provided  however  that  where  less  than  five percent of a
      property's  rentable  square  footage  is  or  will  be   dedicated   to
      residential  purposes, that use shall be considered de minimus and shall
      not be considered in determining benefits under this part.
        (a) For purposes of this paragraph, "property" means the real property
      contained by an individual tax lot.
        (b) Notwithstanding  subparagraph  (a)  of  this  paragraph,  where  a
      building  or  structure is owned in condominium form, and an application
      for benefits under this part includes more than one property in the same
      condominium, then for purposes of this paragraph, the five  percent  and
      twenty  percent of the rentable square footage shall be determined based
      on the aggregate usage of all such properties.
        (c) Hotel uses, as described in subdivision d of this  section,  shall
      not be considered residential.
        (2)  Utility  property. No abatement benefits under this part shall be
      provided for utility property.
        (3) Restricted activity. No benefits pursuant to this  part  shall  be
      granted  for  construction  work  on property any part of which is to be
      used for a restricted activity.
        d. Hotel uses. Benefits shall be available for commercial construction
      work or renovation construction work on a building or structure for  the
      property's  square  footage used to provide lodging and support services
      for transient guests.
        e. Filing requirements. (1) Time to file. (a) Preliminary application.
      (i) Building permit. No benefits pursuant to this part shall be  granted
      for  any  construction  work  unless  the  applicant filed a preliminary
      application for such benefits on or before the date of issuance  of  the
      first  building  permit for such work. This requirement may be satisfied
      where the applicant's  architect,  contractor  or  other  representative
    
      authorized  to  file the application for such building permit files with
      the department on behalf of  the  applicant  a  preliminary  application
      containing such information as the department shall prescribe by rule.
        (ii)  No  building  permit  required. Where construction work does not
      require a  building  permit,  a  notarized  letter  from  the  project's
      architect  or  engineer  notifying  the department of this fact shall be
      filed within thirty calendar days of the commencement  of  construction.
      In  such circumstance, such letter shall also satisfy the requirement of
      a preliminary application if the letter contains all of the  information
      required  for  a  preliminary  application under rules prescribed by the
      department.
        (b) Final application. Applicants shall file a final  application  for
      benefits  no  later than one year from the date of issuance of the first
      building permit for construction work, or, where construction work  does
      not  require  a building permit, no later than one year from the date of
      commencement of construction.
        (2) Who may file for benefits. An applicant shall be:
        (a) obligated to pay real property tax  on  the  property,  either  by
      virtue of ownership or contract; or
        (b)  the  record  owner or lessee of property that is exempt from real
      property taxation who has entered into an agreement  to  sell  or  lease
      such  property to another person. Such applicant shall be a co-applicant
      with such owner or lessee.
        (3) Applicant affidavit. No benefits pursuant to this  part  shall  be
      granted  for  any  construction  work  unless  the  applicant  provides,
      together with the final application,  an  affidavit  setting  forth  the
      following information:
        (a)  a statement that within the seven years immediately preceding the
      date of the preliminary application for benefits, neither the applicant,
      nor any person owning a substantial interest in the property as  defined
      in  subparagraph  (c)  of  this  paragraph, nor any officer, director or
      general partner of the applicant or such person was finally  adjudicated
      by  a  court  of  competent  jurisdiction  to  have violated section two
      hundred thirty-five of the real property law or any section  of  article
      one  hundred  fifty of the penal law or any similar arson law of another
      state with respect to any building,  or  was  an  officer,  director  or
      general  partner  of  a  person  at  the  time  such  person was finally
      adjudicated to have violated such law; and
        (b) a statement setting forth any pending charges  alleging  violation
      of  section  two  hundred  thirty-five  of  the real property law or any
      section of article one hundred fifty of the penal  law  or  any  similar
      arson  law  of  another jurisdiction with respect to any building by the
      applicant or any person owning a substantial interest in the property as
      defined in subparagraph (c) of this paragraph, or any officer,  director
      or general partner of the applicant or such person.
        (c)  "Substantial  interest"  as  used  in this subdivision shall mean
      ownership and control of an  interest  of  ten  percent  or  more  in  a
      property or any person owning a property.
        (d)  If any person described in the statement required by subparagraph
      (b) of this paragraph is finally adjudicated by  a  court  of  competent
      jurisdiction  to  be  guilty of any charge listed in such statement, the
      recipient shall cease to be eligible for benefits pursuant to this  part
      and shall pay with interest any taxes for which an abatement was claimed
      pursuant to this part.
        f.  Requirement  to  file  income  and expense statements. No benefits
      pursuant to this part shall be granted for any  property  unless  income
      and  expense  statements  are filed for the property with respect to the
      tax year as to which the assessment roll described in paragraph  (2)  of
    
      subdivision b of section 11-269 of this part applies, and all subsequent
      tax  years up to and including the tax year on which the assessment roll
      described in paragraph (3) of subdivision b of section  11-269  of  this
      part applies.
        g.  Co-application  with  public  entity. A co-applicant with a public
      entity may be eligible for abatement benefits,  provided  that  for  any
      period  for  which the property is exempt from real property tax because
      it is owned or controlled by a  public  entity,  no  benefits  shall  be
      available  to such recipient under this part. Such recipient may receive
      benefits under this part when the property is no longer eligible for  an
      exemption  as follows: (1) No benefits under this part shall be provided
      during the period of exemption; (2) during such period of exemption, the
      years of the benefit  period  applicable  to  the  project  provided  in
      subdivision  c  of  section 11-269 of this part shall not be tolled, but
      shall run in accordance with the applicable schedule  provided  therein;
      and  (3)  the  recipient  shall,  starting  with  the date the exemption
      ceases, and continuing  until  the  abatement  benefit  period  expires,
      receive  the  abatement  benefits to which such recipient is entitled in
      the tax year that corresponds to the year of the benefit period provided
      in subdivision c of section 11-269 of this part.

      has been granted benefits for industrial construction work,  and  where,
      before the benefit period expires, less than seventy-five percent of the
      total  net  square footage is used or held out for use for manufacturing
      activities, no further benefits for industrial construction  work  shall
      be provided except as provided in this subdivision. Taxes, together with
      interest,  shall  become  due  and  owing after such date of the use for

      construction work.

      property and continuing until the expiration of the benefit  period  for
      commercial construction work, receive any abatement which such applicant
      would  have  received  in  the  corresponding  tax  year pursuant to the
      benefits granted for commercial construction work.
        (3) Any applicant whose property has been granted benefits under  this
      part  for  industrial construction work in any area of the city on whose
      property at least sixty-five percent of the net square footage continues
      to be used or held  out  for  use  for  manufacturing  activities  after

      rata share of tax for which an abatement was claimed during the tax year
      in which such conversion occurred.
        (4)  Where  the  property  is  receiving  the  additional   industrial
      abatement  pursuant  to paragraph (5) of subdivision c of section 11-269
      of this part, such additional industrial abatement shall cease from  the
      date of conversion to commercial property.

      work, and who uses such property for any restricted  activity  prior  to
      the  expiration  of  the  benefit period, shall cease to be eligible for

      cease to be eligible for further abatement for commercial, industrial or
      renovation construction work as of the date such property was first used
      as residential property, as follows:

      property is used as residential property,  then  that  portion  of  such
      property  used  as  residential  property shall cease to be eligible for
      further abatement;
        (c) notwithstanding subparagraph (b) of  this  paragraph,  where  less
      than  five  percent  of  a property's rentable square footage is used as
      residential property, that use will be considered de  minimus  and  will
      not be a basis for benefits to cease under this subdivision; and
        (d) such recipient of benefits that cease under this subdivision shall
      pay,  with  interest, any taxes for which an abatement was claimed after
      the conversion  of  the  property  as  described  in  this  subdivision,

      during  the  tax  year  in  which such use occurred. The abatement shall
      continue for the commercial, industrial or renovation construction  work
      for the portion of the property that continues to be used for commercial
      purposes.
        (2)  For  purposes  of  paragraph  (1) of this subdivision, "property"
      means the real property contained by an individual tax lot.

      building  or  structure is owned in condominium form, and an application
      for benefits under this part includes more than one property in the same
      condominium, then for purposes of this subdivision, the five percent and
      twenty percent of the rentable square footage shall be determined  based
      on the aggregate usage of all such properties.
        e.  Conversion  to  retail  use. (1) Where a property has been granted
      benefits for industrial  or  commercial  construction  work  in  special
      commercial  abatement areas on buildings where not more than ten percent
      of the building or structure is used  for  retail  purposes  and  where,
      before  the benefit period expires, the property or a portion thereof is
      converted so that ten percent or more of the building  or  structure  is
      used for retail purposes, the department shall recalculate the abatement
      upon conversion as provided in subdivision six of this section.
        (2)  Where  a  property  has  been  granted  benefits  for  renovation
      construction work in renovation areas  and  where,  before  the  benefit
      period  expires,  the property or a portion of the property is converted
      so that more than five percent of the building or structure is used  for
      retail  purposes,  the  department  shall recalculate the abatement upon
      conversion as provided in subdivision f of this section.
        e-1. Conversion of use by peaking units. Any applicant whose  property
      has  been  granted  benefits under this part for industrial construction
      work as a peaking unit and who converts such property in any tax year to
      a use that no longer qualifies it as a peaking unit, or  who  uses  such
      property in a manner inconsistent with the definition of a peaking unit,
      shall be ineligible for abatement benefits during any such tax year. Any
      such  recipient  of  benefits shall pay with interest taxes for which an
      abatement was claimed during any portion of such tax year.
        f. Recalculation of abatement upon conversion. If, during the  benefit
      period,  a  recipient  converts  square  footage  within any building or
      structure, the department may recalculate the benefit  granted  pursuant
      to  this  part  to  reflect  the  benefit  for  which the current use is
      eligible under this part and  rules  that  may  be  promulgated  by  the
      department.
        g. The burden shall at all times be on the recipient to demonstrate by
      clear  and  convincing  evidence that property subject to benefits under
    
      this part is used as stated in the preliminary  and  final  applications
      for benefits filed by the recipient with the department.

      commission shall meet in two thousand nine and at least once every  five
      years  thereafter  to  determine  the  boundaries  of special commercial
      abatement areas which it is authorized, but not required,  to  designate
      pursuant  to  this  section.  The  areas  designated  by  the commission
      established pursuant to title two-D of article four of the real property
      tax law in effect as of June thirtieth, two thousand eight shall  remain
      in  effect  until  the  first taxable status date after the city council
      approves  a  new  designation  pursuant  to  paragraph   (4)   of   this
      subdivision.
        (2)  In  years  when  special  commercial  abatement  areas  are to be
      designated, no later than October first, the  commission  shall  provide
      public  notice  of such designation by publishing a notice at least once
      in a  newspaper  of  general  circulation  setting  forth  the  proposed
      boundaries.  Notice  may  also  be  provided  electronically  or  in  an
      electronic medium, such  as  a  website,  in  a  manner  the  commission
      determines  to  be appropriate. Notice must be provided not earlier than
      five nor later than fifteen days before the  date  of  the  commission's
      public  hearing to hear all persons interested in the designation of the
      areas. The notice required by this paragraph shall be published  in  the
      City  Record  and  a  newspaper  of general circulation in the city, and
      copies thereof shall be forwarded to each council member  and  community
      board.
    
        (3)  The  commission  shall make such designation, and notify the city
      council of such designation, not later than November first of each  year
      when special commercial abatement areas are to be designated.
        (4)  Within  thirty  days  after  the first stated meeting of the city
      council following the receipt of notice of such  designation,  the  city
      council  may,  by majority vote, disapprove such designation. If, within
      such thirty-day period, the city council fails to act or fails to act by
      the required vote, the city council shall be  deemed  to  have  approved
      such  designation.  Such  designation  shall  take  effect  on the first
      taxable status date after the city council approves such designation and
      shall remain in effect until the first taxable  status  date  after  the
      city council approves such new designation.
        (5)  The  commission  may designate any area other than the area lying
      south of the center line of 96th Street in the borough of Manhattan,  to
      be  a  special  commercial  abatement  area if it determines that market
      conditions in the area are such  that  the  availability  of  a  special
      abatement is required in order to encourage commercial construction work
      in  such  area.  In  making  such  determination,  the  commission shall
      consider, among other factors, the existence in such area of  a  special
      need  for  commercial  and  job development, high unemployment, economic
      distress or unusually large numbers of vacant, underutilized, unsuitable
      or   substandard   structures,   or   other   substandard,   unsanitary,
      deteriorated  or  deteriorating  conditions,  with  or  without tangible
      blight.
        (6) If the commission fails to meet for more than five years, all  new
      applications  for  special commercial abatement area benefits postmarked
      after the fifth anniversary of the commission's last  meeting  shall  be
      deemed applications for regular area benefits.
        c.  Renovation  areas. The following areas in the borough of Manhattan
      shall be designated as renovation areas. Except as provided in paragraph
      (6) of subdivision c of section 11-269  of  this  part,  new  commercial
      construction  in  a  renovation area shall not be eligible for abatement
      benefits. Renovation areas shall be limited to:

      shall  be  a commercial exclusion area. Commercial construction projects
    
      in the commercial exclusion area shall not be eligible  to  receive  tax
      abatements pursuant to this part.
