Section 11-242 ::    
        
     
        ยง  11-242  Exemption  and  tax  abatement in regard to improvements of
      substandard dwellings. a. As used in this section, the  following  terms
      shall  have the following meanings: 1. "Alteration" and "improvement": a
      physical change in an existing dwelling other  than  painting,  ordinary
      repairs, normal replacements or maintenance items.
        2. "Existing dwelling": a class A multiple dwelling in existence prior
      to the commencement of alterations for which tax exemption and abatement
      is  claimed  under  the  terms of this section and for which a valuation
      appears on the annual record of assessed valuation of the city  for  the
      fiscal year nineteen hundred fifty-five--nineteen hundred fifty-six.
        3.  "Start" on alteration or improvement: begin any physical operation
      undertaken for the purpose of making alterations or improvements  to  an
      existing dwelling.
        4.  "Complete" an alteration or improvement: conclude or terminate any
      physical  operation  such  as  is   referred   to   in   the   preceding
      sub-paragraph,  to  an  extent  or  degree  which  renders such building
      capable of use for the purpose for which the improvements or alterations
      were intended.
        5. "Multiple dwelling": multiple dwellings as that term is defined  in
      section four of the multiple dwelling law.
        b.  Any  increase in assessed valuation resulting from alterations and
      improvements to  existing  dwellings  to  eliminate  presently  existing
      unhealthy or dangerous conditions in any existing dwelling or to replace
      inadequate and obsolete sanitary facilities in any such dwelling, any of
      which  represent  fire or health hazards, or to provide central or other
      appropriate and approved heating, except  insofar  as  the  gross  cubic
      content  of  the  building  is  increased  thereby, shall be exempt from
      taxation for local purposes for a  period  of  twelve  years  after  the
      taxable   status  date  immediately  following  the  completion  of  the
      alterations and improvements,  to  the  extent  that  such  increase  in
      assessed  valuation  result from the reasonable cost of such alterations
      and improvements, providing that construction  is  started  after  March
      first,   nineteen  hundred  fifty-five  and  completed  before  December
      thirty-first,  nineteen  hundred  fifty-nine.  The  asssessed  valuation
      allocated  to  such  dwelling  after  such  alterations and improvements
      during such period  of  twelve  years,  exclusive  of  the  increase  in
      valuation  which  is  exempted,  shall  not  exceed the valuation of the
      previously existing dwelling appearing on the assessment rolls after the
      taxable status date  immediately  preceding  the  commencement  of  such
      alterations  and  improvements.  The  assessed  valuation  of  the  land
      occupied by such dwelling and any increase in valuation  resulting  from
      alterations  and  improvements  other  than  those made pursuant to this
      section, shall not be affected by the provisions of this section.
        c. The taxes upon any such property,  including  the  land,  shall  be
      abated  and reduced by an amount equal to eight and one-third per centum
      of the reasonable cost of such alterations and  improvements  each  year
      for  a  period  of nine years commencing with the first tax bill for the
      first tax year in which the exemption herein provided is effective,  but
      such  abatement of taxes in any consecutive twelve-month period shall in
      no event exceed the amount of taxes payable in such period.
        d. The  department  of  buildings  shall  determine  and  certify  the
      reasonable  cost  of  any such alterations and improvements and for that
      purpose may adopt rules and regulations, administer oaths  to  and  take
      testimony  of any person, including but not limited to the owner of such
      property, may issue subpoenas requiring the attendance of  such  persons
      and  the  production  of  such  books,  papers or other documents as the
      department shall deem necessary, may make preliminary estimates  of  the
      maximum  reasonable  cost  of  such  alterations  and  improvements, may
    
      establish maximum allowable costs for specified units, fixtures or  work
      in  such  alterations or improvements, and may require the submission of
      plans and specifications of such alteration and improvements before  the
      start  thereof. Application forms for the benefits of this section shall
      be filed with the  tax  commission  between  February  first  and  March
      fifteenth and the tax commission shall certify to the city collector the
      amount  of taxes to be abated and reduced, pursuant to the certification
      of the commissioner of buildings as herein provided. No such application
      shall be accepted unless accompanied by copies of  certificates  of  the
      city  planning commission and the commissioner of buildings, as provided
      in this subdivision and in subdivision e of this section.
        e. To the end that alterations and improvements in such property shall
      interfere  as  little  as  practicable  with  urgently   needed   public
      improvements,  and  the  clearance  and  rebuilding  of  substandard and
      insanitary areas, and shall be confined to multiple dwellings which  are
      structurally  sound,  comply  with applicable provisions of law, and are
      provided with adequate central or other appropriate and approved heating
      exemption or abatement from taxation hereunder shall  be  restricted  to
      dwellings  which:  (1)  the  city  planning  commission certify will not
      unduly interfere with projected public improvements or the clearance and
      rebuilding of substandard and insanitary areas which certification shall
      be evidenced by a certificate describing the property involved and shall
      be issued upon application to such  city  planning  commission  in  such
      manner  and  in  such  form  as  may be prescribed by such city planning
      commission, and (2) which the department of buildings shall  certify  to
      be  structurally  sound,  comply  with  applicable provisions of law and
      provide  central  or  other  appropriate  and  approved  heating,  which
      certification  shall  be  evidenced  by  a  certificate  describing  the
      property involved and shall be issued upon application to the department
      of buildings in such manner and in such form as  may  be  prescribed  by
      such  department.  Where  the  improvements  and  alterations include or
      benefit that part of a building which is occupied by stores or used  for
      commercial  purposes, the cost shall be apportioned so that the benefits
      of this section shall not be provided for the cost of  the  improvements
      or alterations made for store or commercial purposes.
        f. Notwithstanding the provisions of the multiple dwelling law, or any
      local  law,  ordinance, provisions of this code, rule or regulation, any
      dwelling to which alterations and improvements are made pursuant to this
      section and which did not require a certificate of  occupancy  on  April
      second, nineteen hundred forty-five, may be occupied lawfully after such
      date  upon  the  completion of such alterations and improvements without
      such  a  certificate  being  obtained,  provided,  however,  that   such
      alterations and improvements shall have been made in conformity with law
      and  the  applicable provisions for fire protection required by articles
      six and seven of the multiple dwelling law.
        g. No owner of a dwelling to which the benefits of this section  shall
      be  applied  nor  any  agent, employee, manager or officer of such owner
      shall directly or indirectly deny to any person because of race,  color,
      creed,  or  religion any of the dwelling accommodations in such property
      or any of the privileges or services incident to occupancy therein.
        h. Each agency to which functions are assigned  by  this  section  may
      adopt rules and regulations for the effectuation of the purposes of this
      section,  and a copy, for each member of the city council, of such rules
      and regulations shall be filed with the clerk of the city council  prior
      to promulgation.
        i.  Any  person  who  shall  knowingly  and  wilfully  make  any false
      statement as to any material matter in any application for the  benefits
      of  this  section  shall be guilty of an offense punishable by a fine of
    
      not more than five hundred dollars or imprisonment  for  not  more  than
      ninety days, or both.
        j.  The  benefits  of  this  section  shall  not apply to any multiple
      dwelling which is not subject to the provisions of the emergency housing
      rent control law, provided that this subdivision shall  not  operate  to
      rescind  any  benefits  granted by the tax commission under this section
      prior to July first, nineteen hundred fifty-eight; and further  provided
      that  where  the benefits herein provided were or are granted by the tax
      commission on or after July first, nineteen hundred fifty-eight  to  any
      multiple  dwelling  which  is decontrolled subsequent to the granting of
      such  benefits,  the  tax  commission  shall  withdraw  such   benefits,
      effective  upon the commencement of the first tax year following the tax
      year in which such multiple dwelling is decontrolled.

      years and shall begin no sooner than the first  tax  period  immediately
      following  the  completion  of  such  alterations  or improvements. Such

      carried  out  in  a  property  transferred from the city of New York and
      where alterations and improvements  are  completed  within  seven  years
      after  the  date  of  transfer  may commence at the beginning of any tax
      period subsequent to the  start  of  such  conversions,  alterations  or
      improvements   and   prior   to  the  completion  of  such  conversions,
      alterations or improvements. The assessed valuation of the land occupied
      by such dwelling and any increase in assessed valuation  resulting  from
      conversions, alterations, or improvements other than those made pursuant

        (A)  in  the case of a conversion under paragraph one, two or three of
      subdivision b of this section, the increased cost is necessary to comply
      with applicable law; or
        (B) in the case of an alteration or improvement under paragraph  seven

        (ii) Notwithstanding any other provisions of this subparagraph, and in

      this  section  for  any  multiple dwellings, buildings or structures not
      owned as a condominium or cooperative, except for multiple dwellings  in
      which  units  have  been  newly created by substantial rehabilitation of
      vacant buildings or conversions of non-residential buildings,  shall  be
      conditioned  on  the  assessed  valuation  of  such  multiple  dwelling,
      building or structure, including  land,  not  exceeding  an  average  of
      thirty thousand dollars per dwelling unit at the time of commencement of
      the  alterations  or  improvements, provided, however, that such average
      shall not exceed $40,000 per dwelling unit at the time  of  commencement
      of  the  alteration  or  improvement  for  alterations  or  improvements
      commenced after the effective date of this local law, which  added  this
      amendment.
        (c)  Exemption  limitations. (i) The increase in assessed valuation of
      the  real  property  resulting  from  the  conversion,   alteration   or
      improvement  under  subdivision  b of this section, shall be exempt from
      taxation as provided in this section, only to  the  extent  provided  in
      this  subparagraph,  provided  that this subparagraph shall not apply to
      any conversions, alterations or improvements commenced on or after  June
      first, nineteen hundred eighty-six, unless such conversions, alterations
      or  improvements  are  carried out in buildings or structures located in
      the borough of Manhattan south of or adjacent to the south side  of  one
      hundred  tenth  street.  The  amount of the increased assessed valuation
      that is exempt from taxation shall depend on the  amount  of  the  total
      assessed  value  per  dwelling unit calculated by dividing the amount of
      the total assessed valuation of the property, as  determined  under  the
    
      real  property  tax law, by the number of dwelling units in the building
      after completion of  the  conversion,  alteration  or  improvement.  The
      amount of increased assessed valuation that will be exempt from taxation
      for  buildings  with  total assessed valuation per dwelling unit of less
      than thirty-eight thousand dollars shall be calculated pursuant  to  the
      following  formula:  (A)  any portion of total assessed valuation of the
      property attributable to the first eighteen thousand  dollars  of  total
      assessed  valuation  per  dwelling  unit,  to  the  extent it represents
      increased assessed valuation, shall be one hundred percent  exempt;  (B)
      any  portion  of  total assessed valuation attributable to the next four
      thousand dollars of total assessed valuation per dwelling unit,  to  the
      extent it represents increased assessed valuation, shall be seventy-five
      percent exempt; (C) any portion of total assessed valuation attributable
      to  the  next  four  thousand  dollars  of  total assessed valuation per
      dwelling unit, to the extent it represents increased assessed valuation,
      shall be fifty  percent  exempt;  (D)  any  portion  of  total  assessed
      valuation  attributable  to  the  next  four  thousand  dollars of total
      assessed valuation per  dwelling  unit,  to  the  extent  it  represents
      increased  assessed  valuation, shall be twenty-five percent exempt; (E)
      any portion of total assessed valuation attributable to the  next  eight
      thousand  dollars  of total assessed valuation per dwelling unit, to the
      extent it represents increased assessed  valuation  per  dwelling  unit,
      shall  be  fully  taxable.  Property with a total assessed valuation per
      dwelling unit of thirty-eight thousand dollars  or  more  shall  not  be
      eligible for a tax exemption under this section.
        (ii)  In  calculating  the amount of increased assessed valuation that
      will be exempt from taxation pursuant to the formula in  clause  (i)  of
      this subparagraph, the full amount of total assessed valuation that does
      not  represent  increased  assessed  valuation  shall be applied in such
      formula prior to the inclusion  of  any  amount  of  increased  assessed
      valuation.
        (iii)  Where  the  real  property  is occupied in part for residential
      purposes  and  in  part  for  non-residential  purposes,  the   assessed
      valuation  of  the property shall be appropriately allocated between the
      residential  and  non-residential  portions.  In  computing  the   total
      assessed  valuation  per dwelling unit under this subparagraph, only the
      amount of valuation so allocated to the  residential  portion  shall  be
      considered.
        (iv) Commencing with the assessment roll for the year nineteen hundred
      eighty-four,  where  there  has been a change in the level of assessment
      from the assessment roll of  the  prior  year  of  properties  receiving
      exemptions  under  this  section, the department of finance may petition
      the state board to  certify  the  percentage  of  such  change  for  the
      purposes  of  this  section. In such petition, the department of finance
      shall submit such information as the state board shall require in  order
      to  certify the percentage of such change. The state board may also make
      such  a  certification  on  its  own  motion.  Upon  receipt   of   such
      certification   from   the   state  board,  the  department  of  housing
      preservation and development may  modify  the  dollar  values  of  total
      assessed  valuation per dwelling unit in clause (i) of this subparagraph
      to reflect the percentage change in the level of assessment as shown  in
      such  certification.  As  used in this subparagraph, the term "change in
      the level of assessment" means the  net  increase  or  decrease  in  the
      assessed  valuation  of  properties  in the assessing unit that received
      exemptions under this section in the current year as compared  to  those
      that  received  exemptions  under  this  section  in the prior year as a
      result of assessing such properties at a higher or lower ratio  of  full
      value.
    
        (v)   (A)  Notwithstanding  the  provisions  of  clause  (i)  of  this
      subparagraph, the department of housing preservation and development may
      reduce or remove the limitations on the exemption from taxation provided
      in  such  clause  with  respect  to  a  particular  property  undergoing
      alteration  or improvement, upon application of the property owner and a
      determination  by  such  department  that  the  increased  benefit  will
      increase the number of dwelling units that will be affordable to persons
      of  low  and  moderate income, and the increased benefit is necessary to
      make economically viable units or improvement in the quality of dwelling
      units that will be affordable to persons of low or moderate income.
        (B) As used in this subparagraph, the term "persons of low or moderate
      income" shall mean persons  who  would  qualify  for  housing  subsidies
      pursuant to section two hundred thirty-five of the national housing act,
      as amended, at one hundred thirty-five percent of the income limitations
      provided therein.
        (C)  Upon  receiving  an application under this subparagraph in proper
      form, the department  of  housing  preservation  and  development  shall
      immediately  submit  it to the community board for the area in which the
      project is located, which may, within forty-five days  of  receiving  it
      and after a public hearing, make recommendations to the department as to
      the  application.  The  department  shall  act on the application within
      sixty days of receiving it from the property owner in proper  form,  but
      not  before  expiration  of the time for the community board to make its
      recommendations, unless the board has acted sooner.
        (d) The department of housing preservation  and  development  may  set
      forth  preliminarily the terms of a determination under subparagraph (b)
      or (c) of this paragraph prior to the commencement  of  the  conversion,
      alteration  or  improvement.  Any  such  determination shall take effect
      after completion of the  work  in  accordance  with  the  terms  of  the
      application made by the property owner.
        (e)  Any  determination  of the department of housing preservation and
      development to increase an abatement  under  subparagraph  (b)  of  this
      paragraph,  or  to  reduce  or  remove  the  exemption limitations under
      subparagraph (c) of  this  paragraph  shall  state  the  basis  for  the
      determination  and  the  data on which the determination was based. Such
      determination shall be published in the City Record for five consecutive
      days after the determination is rendered.
        d-1. (1) A group of  multiple  dwellings  which  was  developed  as  a
      planned  community  and  which  is  owned  as  two separate condominiums
      containing a total of ten thousand  or  more  dwelling  units  shall  be
      eligible   for   tax   exemption  and  abatement  as  provided  in  this
      subdivision.
        (2) any increase in assessed valuation resulting from  alterations  or
      improvements financed with substantial governmental assistance to one or
      more  multiple  dwellings  in a planned community described in paragraph
      one of  this  subdivision  shall  be  exempt  from  taxation  for  local
      purposes. Such exemption shall be equal to the increase in the valuation
      which  is  subject  to  exemption under this paragraph for thirty years.
      After such period of time, the amount of such  exempted  assessed  value
      shall  be  reduced  by  twenty percent in each succeeding year until the
      assessed value of the alterations or improvements is fully taxable. Such
      exemption may commence at the beginning of any tax quarter subsequent to
      the start of such alterations or improvements. In no  event  shall  such
      alterations   or  improvements  directly  or  indirectly  result  in  an
      equalization increase in the assessed valuation of any multiple dwelling
      forming  part  of  the  planned  community  where  such  alterations  or
      improvements are performed.
    
        (3)  the  taxes  on  a planned community described in paragraph one of
      this subdivision, including the land, may be abated by an amount not  to
      exceed  the greater of (i) one hundred fifty per centum of the certified
      reasonable cost of the alterations or improvements, as determined  under
      the rules of the department of housing preservation and development, and
      (ii) the construction cost of the alterations or improvements identified
      in  such  rules.  Such  abatement  shall  not be effective for more than
      twenty years and the  annual  abatement  of  taxes  in  any  consecutive
      twelve-month  period  shall  not  be  greater than ten per centum of the
      total abatement granted and shall not exceed the amount of taxes payable
      in such consecutive twelve-month period. Such abatement shall  begin  no
      sooner  than  the  first  quarterly  tax  bill immediately following the
      completion of such alterations  or  improvements.  The  limitations  set
      forth  in  the  second  paragraph of paragraph three of subdivision d of
      this section for multiple dwellings, buildings and structures  owned  as
      condominiums  shall be inapplicable to benefits granted pursuant to this
      subdivision. Abatement benefits granted  pursuant  to  this  subdivision
      shall  be  apportioned  among all of the condominium tax lots within the
      condominium in which the alterations or improvements are made,  although
      such alterations or improvements may have been made to one or fewer than
      all of the multiple dwellings therein.
        (4)  in  the  event  that  multiple  alterations  or  improvements are
      undertaken in a planned community described in  paragraph  one  of  this
      subdivision  and  separate  applications for benefits therefor are made,
      all requirements concerning physical condition of  and  compliance  with
      law by the multiple dwellings in such planned community shall apply only
      upon  completion  of all such alterations or improvements, provided that
      all such alterations or improvements are completed within six years.
        (5) except as provided in this subdivision, all  of  the  requirements
      imposed  by  this section on projects described in subdivision b of this
      section shall be  applicable  to  alterations  or  improvements  granted
      benefits pursuant to this subdivision.
        (6)  this  subdivision  shall  be  applicable  only  to alterations or
      improvements completed prior  to  December  thirty-first,  two  thousand
      five.
        (7)  Alterations  and  improvements  receiving tax benefits under this
      subdivision shall not be used as the basis of an application for a major
      capital improvement  rent  increase  under  state  laws  governing  rent
      control and rent stabilization, provided, however, that such alterations
      and  improvements  may  be  eligible  for  a  major  capital improvement
      increase in an amount not to exceed the amount of the decrease in  rents
      that  occurs  as  a  result of the installation of individual electrical
      metering for the  residential  units.  Such  major  capital  improvement
      increase shall be implemented on a per unit basis.
        e.  Notwithstanding any provision of this section or any other section
      of the code to the contrary, where such dwelling is in an area  where  a
      plan  of  redevelopment,  program  of  neighborhood improvement, housing
      maintenance,   demonstration   rehabilitation   or   concentrated   code
      enforcement  is  being  carried out, the rents subsequent to conversion,
      alteration or  improvement  may  exceed  the  maximum  amount  allowable
      pursuant to chapter four of title twenty-six of the code where necessity
      for  the  adjustment  of  such  rents  is certified by the department of
      housing preservation and development.
        f. Subject to the provisions of subdivision d  of  this  section,  the
      department  of  housing preservation and development shall determine and
      certify the reasonable cost of  any  such  conversions,  alterations  or
      improvements  and  eligibility  for the benefits of this section and for
      that purpose may adopt rules and regulations, administer  oaths  to  and
    
      take the testimony of any person, including but not limited to the owner
      of  such  property, may issue subpoenas requiring the attendance of such
      persons and the  production  of  such  bills,  books,  papers  or  other
      documents  as it shall deem necessary, may make preliminary estimates of
      the  maximum  reasonable  cost  of  such  conversions,  alterations   or
      improvements,  may establish maximum allowable costs of specified units,
      fixtures or work in such conversions, alterations or  improvements,  and
      may   require  the  submission  of  plans  and  specifications  of  such
      conversions, alterations or improvements, and may require the submission
      of  plans  and  specifications  of  such  conversions,  alterations   or
      improvements  before  the  start thereof. Applications for certification
      shall include  all  bills  and  other  documents  showing  the  cost  of
      construction   or   such  other  evidence  of  such  cost  as  shall  be
      satisfactory to the department of housing preservation and  development,
      including,  without  limitation,  certification  of  cost by a certified
      public accountant  in  accordance  with  generally  accepted  accounting
      principles.  Applications  for certification for a building eligible for
      benefits pursuant to paragraph three of subdivision d of  this  section,
      for  alterations  or  improvements completed more than three years after
      its conversion to cooperative or condominium  ownership,  shall  include
      such  documentation  of  the  sale  price  of  dwelling  units  or stock
      allocated to such dwelling units as may be required by the department of
      housing preservation and  development,  including  but  not  limited  to
      certification  of  sales  price  by  a  certified  public accountant. In
      addition, such applications shall contain the consent of  the  applicant
      to  allow  the department of housing preservation and development access
      to records, including but not limited  to  other  tax  records,  as  the
      department   may   deem   appropriate  to  enforce  such  conditions  of
      eligibility.  Applications  for  certification  filed  for  conversions,
      alterations  or  improvements completed after December thirty-first, two
      thousand eleven pursuant to paragraphs one through seven  and  paragraph
      nine of subdivision b of this section shall be made after completion and
      within  thirty-six  months  following  the  start of construction of the
      conversion, alteration or  improvement,  except  that  applications  for
      certification  for  alterations  or improvements undertaken by a housing
      development fund company organized pursuant to  article  eleven  of  the
      private  housing finance law, which are carried out with the substantial
      assistance of grants, loans or subsidies  from  any  federal,  state  or
      local governmental agency or instrumentality or which are carried out in
      a  property  transferred  from  the city of New York shall be made after
      completion and within seventy-two months  following  the  start  of  the
      construction  of  the  alteration or improvement. Provided, however, the
      department of housing preservation and development is empowered to grant
      an extension of the period for application for any project  carried  out
      with  the  substantial assistance of loans, grants or subsidies from any
      federal, state or local governmental agency or instrumentality, if  such
      application  is  made  within  seventy-two  months  from commencement of
      construction. Applications for certification pursuant to paragraph eight
      of subdivision b of this section shall be filed within twelve months  of
      the date of completion as provided by such subdivision.
        g.  To  the  end that conversions, alterations or improvements in such
      property shall interfere as little as practicable  with  the  clearance,
      rehabilitation  or  rebuilding  of sub-standard and insanitary areas and
      shall be confined to buildings and  structures  which  are  structurally
      sound  and comply with applicable provisions of law, eligibility for the
      benefits of this section shall  be  restricted  to  such  buildings  and
      structures  which the department of housing preservation and development
      shall certify:
    
        (1) to be structurally sound and to comply with applicable  provisions
      of   law,   as   determined   by  the  department  of  buildings,  which
      certification  shall  be  evidenced  by  a  certificate  describing  the
      property involved; and
        (2)  if  in  an  area for which a final plan of clearance, replanning,
      reconstruction,  rehabilitation,  or  redevelopment  has  been  approved
      pursuant  to  article  fifteen of the general municipal law, or if in an
      area for which an urban renewal plan or tests, studies or demonstrations
      have been approved pursuant to article fifteen of the general  municipal
      law,  to be improved in conformity with such replanning, reconstruction,
      rehabilitation, redevelopment, tests, studies, demonstrations  or  plan;
      and
        (3) if in an area where a program of local neighborhood improvement or
      housing  maintenance is being carried out, to be in conformity with such
      program.
        h. Application forms for the benefits of this section shall  be  filed
      with the department of finance within the time periods to be established
      by  rules  and  regulations  promulgated  by  the  department of housing
      preservation and development pursuant to subdivision m of this  section.
      The  department  of  finance  shall  certify  the  amount of taxes to be
      abated, pursuant to the  certification  of  the  department  of  housing
      preservation  and  development  as  herein provided. No such application
      shall be accepted unless accompanied by a copy of the certificate of the
      department of housing preservation and development both as to reasonable
      cost and as to eligibility as provided in subdivision f of this section.
        i. The benefits of this section shall not apply:
        (1) except as provided in  subdivision  d  of  this  section,  to  any
      existing  dwelling  which  is  not  subject  to  the  provisions  of the
      emergency  housing  rent  control  law  or  to   the   city   rent   and
      rehabilitation  law  or  to  the  city  rent stabilization law or to the
      private housing  finance  law  or  to  any  federal  law  providing  for
      supervision or regulation by the United States department of housing and
      urban development;
        (2)  to  any  private dwelling, notwithstanding any other provision of
      this section, unless it is in an area where a plan of  redevelopment  or
      program  of neighborhood improvement, housing maintenance, demonstration
      rehabilitation or concentrated code enforcement is being carried out and
      the department of housing preservation and development  finds  that  the
      conversion, alteration or improvement is in conformity with such plan of
      redevelopment,   or   program   of   neighborhood  improvement,  housing
      maintenance,   demonstration   rehabilitation   or   concentrated   code
      enforcement;  provided  that,  notwithstanding  the  foregoing,  for the
      purposes of this section, a class A multiple dwelling may be  deemed  to
      include  any  garden-type  maisonette  dwelling  project consisting of a
      series of dwelling units which together  and  in  their  aggregate  were
      arranged  or  designed  to  provide  three  or  more  apartments and are
      provided as a group collectively with all essential  services  such  as,
      but  not  limited to, water supply, house sewers and heat, and which are
      in existence and operated as a unit under single ownership on  the  date
      upon  which  an application for the benefits of this section is received
      by the department of housing preservation and development,  even  though
      certificates  of  occupancy  were issued for portions thereof as private
      dwellings;
        (3) to any property receiving tax exemption or abatement  concurrently
      for  rehabilitation or new construction under any other provision of New
      York state or New York city law with the exception of any alteration  or
      improvement  to property receiving such tax exemption or abatement under
      the provisions of the private housing finance  law,  provided,  however,
    
      that  the benefits of this section shall not apply to any alterations or
      improvements done  in  connection  with  the  refinancing,  pursuant  to
      section  223f  of  the  national  housing  act, as amended, of a housing
      project  organized  pursuant  to  article  two  and  article four of the
      private housing finance law;
        (4)  to  any  multiple  dwelling  for  ordinary  repairs  and   normal
      replacement  of  maintenance  items,  as  provided  in  paragraph one of
      subdivision a,  hereof  in  the  event  that  the  dwelling  thereof  is
      receiving  the  benefits  of this section for other ordinary repairs and
      normal replacement of maintenance items as of the December  thirty-first
      preceding the date of application;
        (5)  to  the  conversion  of  any  building  or  structure, or portion
      thereof:

      where a floor area  ratio,  as  that  term  is  defined  in  the  zoning
      resolution  of  the city of New York, of fifteen or greater is permitted
      by said resolution, or (b)  located  in  the  city  of  New  York  where
      residential  conversion  as  of  right  is  not  permitted by the zoning
      resolution, provided, however,  that  notwithstanding  anything  to  the
      contrary  contained  in  this subparagraph, the benefits of this section
      shall apply to any building or structure or portion  thereof  which  was
      purchased  from the city of New York on or after January first, nineteen
      hundred and eighty and prior to December thirty-first, nineteen  hundred
      and  eighty-four  and  which  was granted a variance for a conversion to

        (ii)   where  such  benefits  are  eliminated  by  regulations  to  be
      promulgated by the department of housing  preservation  and  development
      pursuant  to  subdivision  m  of  this section, unless, in the case of a
      building or structure in the county of New York,  construction  actually
      commenced  prior to January first, nineteen hundred eighty-two, pursuant
      to an alteration permit, or, in the case of a building or  structure  in
      the counties of Bronx, Kings, Queens and Richmond, construction actually

      less than sixty days prior  to  its  publication  in  the  City  Record,
      pursuant to section eleven hundred five of the charter, and

      dwelling or class A multiple dwelling used  in  whole  or  in  part  for
      single  room  occupancy, regardless of the status or use of the building
      after the conversion, alteration or improvement unless such  conversion,
      alteration or improvement is carried out with the substantial assistance
      of grants, loans or subsidies from any federal, state or local agency or
      instrumentality.
        (7) to any conversion of or alteration or improvement, commenced on or

      the  conversion,  alteration  or  improvement  unless  such  conversion,
    
      alteration or improvement is carried out with the substantial assistance
      of grants, loans or subsidies from any federal, state or local agency or

      corporation  and  the department of housing preservation and development

        (b) With respect to conversions, alterations or improvements completed
      on or after December thirty-first, two thousand eleven:
        (i)  except  as  otherwise  provided  in  this section with respect to
      multiple dwellings, buildings and structures owned and  operated  either
      by  limited-profit housing companies established pursuant to article two
      of  the  private  housing  finance  law   or   redevelopment   companies

      condominium that has  an  average  assessed  value  of  thirty  thousand
      dollars  or  more  per  dwelling  unit  shall  only be eligible for such

      and
        (ii) no benefits pursuant to this section shall  be  granted  for  the

        (c)  If  the  conversions,  alterations or improvements for which such
      multiple dwelling,  building  or  structure  has  applied  for  benefits
      pursuant  to  this section are not completed on the date upon which such

      such conversion, alteration or improvement.
        (d) The revocation of  benefits  granted  to  any  multiple  dwelling,

      electronically if the department of housing preservation and development
      makes electronic filing available.
        j. Notwithstanding the provisions of the multiple dwelling law, or any
      local law, ordinance, provisions of this code, rule or  regulation,  any
      dwelling to which alterations and improvements are made pursuant to this
      section  and  which  did not require a certificate of occupancy on April
    
      second, nineteen hundred forty-five, may be occupied lawfully after such
      date upon the completion of such alterations  and  improvements  without
      such   a  certificate  being  obtained,  provided,  however,  that  such
      alterations and improvements shall have been made in conformity with law
      and  the  applicable provisions for fire protection required by articles
      six and seven of the multiple dwelling law.
        k. No owner of a dwelling to which the benefits of this section  shall

      shall directly or indirectly deny to any person because of race,  color,
      creed,  national origin, gender, sexual orientation, disability, marital

      pursuant  to  either  chapter  seven of title twenty-six of this code or
      section 26-509 of such code, any of the dwelling accommodations in  such
      property  or  any  of  the  privileges or services incident to occupancy
      therein. The term "disability" as used in this  subdivision  shall  have
      the  meaning  set  forth  in  section 8-102 of the code. Nothing in this
      subdivision shall restrict such  consideration  in  the  development  of
      housing  accommodations  for  the  purpose  of providing for the special
      needs of a particular group.
        l. Any person  who  shall  knowingly  and  willfully  make  any  false
      statement  as to any material matter in any application for the benefits
      of this section shall be guilty of an offense punishable by  a  fine  of
      not  more  than  five  hundred dollars or imprisonment for not more than
      ninety days, or both. The commissioner  of  the  department  of  housing
      preservation  and  development  may  reduce  or  revoke  past and future
      exemption or tax abatement authorized pursuant to this  section  if  the
      application  for  tax  exemption  or  tax  abatement  contains  a  false
      statement or false information as  to  a  material  matter  or  omits  a
      material matter.
        m.  Each  agency or department to which functions are assigned by this
      section  may  adopt  and  promulgate  rules  and  regulations  for   the
      effectuation of the purpose of this section.
        n.  The department of housing preservation and development may require
      a filing fee in an amount as  provided  by  the  rules  and  regulations
      promulgated  by  the  department of housing preservation and development
      pursuant to subdivision m of this section.
        o. Any tax abatement granted for a period of nine years to a  multiple
      dwelling  aided  by  a  loan  provided  by the city of New York prior to
      January first, nineteen  hundred  seventy-one,  shall  upon  application
      therefor  be  adjusted  to  extend  for  a period of up to twenty years,
      provided that the total abatement before and after such adjustment shall
      not exceed the total abatement to  which  such  property  was  initially
      entitled under this section.
        p.  This section is enacted pursuant to the provisions of section four
      hundred eighty-nine of the real property tax law and subdivision two  of
      section four hundred five of the private housing finance law.
        q.  No  application for the benefits of this section shall be accepted
      by the department of finance if there are outstanding real estate  taxes
      or  water  and sewer charges or payments in lieu of taxes which were due
      and owing as of the last day of the tax period  preceding  the  date  of
      such  filing  with the department of finance, provided that an applicant
      aided by article eight or article fifteen of the private housing finance
      law shall have such application accepted by the department of finance if
      there are no outstanding real estate taxes or water  and  sewer  charges
    
      due  and  owing  as  of  the  last  day  of  the  tax  period  preceding
      commencement of construction.
        r.  In the event that any building or structure receiving the benefits
      of this section shall become operated exclusively for commercial,  hotel
      or  transient  hotel  use,  the  tax  commission shall withdraw benefits
      granted herein prospectively.
        s. The benefits of this section shall  not  apply  to  alterations  or
      improvements   to   existing   dwellings   in   existence   on  December
      thirty-first, nineteen hundred seventy-five where (i)  such  alterations
      or  improvements  were  completed  on  or  before December thirty-first,
      nineteen hundred seventy-five, and (ii) no  dwelling  units  thereof  on
      December  thirty-first,  nineteen hundred seventy-five had rentals which
      were subject to control by the city rent agency pursuant to chapter four
      of title twenty-six of the code. This subdivision  shall  not  apply  to
      alterations  or  improvements  to  any  building  or  structure which is
      benefitted  by  mortgage  insurance  pursuant  to  section  two  hundred
      thirteen  of  the  national  housing act for applications filed prior to
      January first, nineteen hundred seventy-nine.
        t. Notwithstanding any law to the contrary, the owner of any  building
      or  structure  eligible for any of the benefits of this section which is
      converted to a class A multiple dwelling,  completed,  or  substantially
      rehabilitated  on  or  after January one, nineteen hundred seventy-four,
      shall register the initial rent for each dwelling unit in such  building
      or  structure  with the New York state division of housing and community
      renewal. After such registration, the rents of such dwelling units shall
      be fully subject to regulations under chapter four of  title  twenty-six
      of the code so long as the benefits of this section are in effect or for
      such longer period as may be provided by law.
        u.  Any  tax  exemption  or  tax abatement authorized pursuant to this
      section may be revoked retroactively by the commissioner  of  department
      of  housing preservation and development or the department of finance of
      the city of New York at any time during the authorized term of such  tax
      exemption  or  tax  abatement  if  real  estate taxes or water and sewer
      charges due to the city of New York remain unpaid for one year after the
      same are due and payable. In no  event  shall  revocation  be  effective
      prior to the date such taxes or charges were first due and payable.
        v.  Where alterations, improvements, or conversions include or benefit
      that part of a building which is not occupied for dwelling purposes  but
      is  occupied  by  stores  or  otherwise  used for commercial purposes or
      community facilities, the increase in assessed valuation and the cost of
      the alteration shall be apportioned so that the benefits of  this  title
      shall  not be provided for alterations, improvements or conversions made
      for other than dwelling purposes.
        w. If any provision of this section or its application to  any  person
      shall   be   held  invalid,  the  remainder  of  this  section  and  the
      applicability of its provisions to other persons or circumstances  shall
      not be affected thereby.
        x.  Notwithstanding any provision of this section, no benefit pursuant
      to paragraph five of subdivision b of this section shall be granted  for
      work  commenced after January first, nineteen hundred eighty, unless the
      applicant establishes that the department of  housing  preservation  and
      development  and  tenants  of  such class A multiple dwelling were given
      notice of (i) the proposed work prior to commencement of such work, (ii)
      the identity of the  owner's  representative,  and  (iii)  the  tenants'
      rights under applicable law with respect to such work, provided that, in
      the  case of a loan program supervised by such department, notice to the
      department  shall  be  unnecessary,  and  further  provided   that   the
      department may itself provide the required notice to the tenants.
    
        y.  Applicants for benefits under the provisions of this section shall
      file with the department of finance a form supplied by  said  department
      which  (i) states an intention to file for benefits under the provisions
      of this section, (ii) describes the work for which tax benefits will  be
      claimed and (iii) estimates the cost of such work which will be eligible
      for benefits. Such form shall be filed prior to the commencement of such
      work.  If  the  scope of such work or the estimated cost thereof changes
      materially, applicant shall file a  revised  statement.  Applicants  who
      fail  to  comply  with  the  requirements  of  this subdivision shall be
      subject to a penalty not to exceed one hundred percent of the filing fee
      otherwise payable pursuant to subdivision n of this section.
        z.  A  former  tenant  or  former   subtenant   of   premises   in   a
      non-residential  building  which is the subject of an application for an
      alteration permit for conversion to a class A multiple  dwelling,  prior
      to  the application for any tax exemption or abatement benefits for such
      building pursuant to this section, and  as  a  condition  to  the  grant
      thereof,  shall  be  entitled  to a relocation award under the terms and
      conditions set forth below:
        (1) As used in this subdivision, the term "eligible tenant" shall mean
      any former tenant or former subtenant who:
        (i) leased and used the vacated premises to conduct  a  manufacturing,
      warehousing,  or  wholesaling business for not less than two consecutive
      years immediately prior to vacating;
        (ii) vacated such premises on or after April first,  nineteen  hundred
      eighty-one for any reason other than eviction for non-payment of rent;
        (iii)  vacated  such  premises  (a) no earlier than twenty-four months
      prior to the filing date of an application for  such  alteration  permit
      and  (b)  no later than the completion of the conversion as evidenced by
      the issuance of a permanent certificate  of  occupancy  for  a  class  A
      multiple dwelling;
        (iv)  either  purchased or leased for a term of not less than eighteen
      months other premises within the city of New York with a floor area  not
      less than one-third of the floor area of the vacated premises;
        (v) relocated their business to such other premises within one year of
      vacating the vacated premises; and
        (vi)  paid  all  commercial  rent  or  occupancy  tax  for the vacated
      premises.  A subtenant shall be eligible to receive a  relocation  award
      notwithstanding any lack of eligibility of its prime tenant;
        (2)  the  relocation  award  shall  not  exceed the greater of (i) the
      aggregate base rent which accrued and was paid by  the  eligible  tenant
      during  the  final  twenty-four  months  of its occupancy of the vacated
      premises or (ii) four dollars for each square  foot  that  the  eligible
      tenant  occupied  in  the  vacated premises during the final twenty-four
      months of its occupancy  of  the  vacated  premises.  As  used  in  this
      subdivision,  base  rent  shall be calculated in the same manner as base
      rent is calculated for purposes of commercial rent or occupancy  tax  in
      the  city  of  New York. However, the aggregate award payable to a prime
      tenant and/or any subtenants of such prime tenant shall not  exceed  the
      amount  which  would have been payable to the prime tenant had the prime
      tenant been eligible for an award based on  the  entire  floor  area  it
      leased  from the owner; and if such limitation applies, the awards shall
      be prorated based upon the total floor area used and  occupied  by  each
      eligible tenant;
        (3)  the  relocation award shall become due and payable to an eligible
      tenant at the time the eligible tenant (i) either  purchases  or  leases
      other premises in accordance with paragraph one of this subdivision, and
      (ii)  certifies  eligibility  to, and demands payment of, the award from
      the owner of the vacated building. If the relocation award is  not  paid
    
      within  thirty  days  of  such  certification and demand, interest shall
      accrue on the relocation award from the date of  the  certification  and
      demand at the rate of twenty-four percent per annum;
        (4)  at  any time after such certification and demand and prior to the
      date of the filing of an application for tax exemption or abatement  for
      the  vacated  building  pursuant to this section, an eligible tenant who
      has not received a relocation award shall have a right to file a  notice
      of  claim.  Such notice of claim shall be filed with the county clerk of
      the county in which the vacated building is located and shall verify the
      claimant's name,  its  compliance  with  eligibility  requirements,  the
      address of the vacated premises, the floor area it occupied, the name of
      the  prime  tenant if the claimant is a subtenant, and all the base rent
      that accrued and was paid by the claimant during the  final  twenty-four
      months of its occupancy;
        (5) a notice of claim, filed in accordance with paragraph four of this
      subdivision,  may be discharged by the filing of an undertaking with the
      clerk of the county in which the premises are located in an amount equal
      to the amount claimed and in accordance with the procedures set forth in
      subdivision four of section nineteen of the lien law, or by the  payment
      into court of such amount in accordance with the procedures set forth in
      section fifty-five of such law;
        (6)  no  tax  exemption or abatement shall be granted pursuant to this
      section unless the department of housing  preservation  and  development
      receives  an  affidavit  from the applicant for benefits of this section
      which verifies that:
        (i) the applicant has caused to be published a notice in  a  newspaper
      of  general circulation within the city of New York, no later than sixty
      days prior to filing of an application for tax  exemption  or  abatement
      pursuant to this section, which advises former tenants and subtenants of
      their rights pursuant to this subdivision; and
        (ii)  no  notice  of  claim  has  been  filed  or all claims have been
      released by the claimants, or secured in accordance with the  provisions
      of  paragraph  five  of  this  subdivision, or discharged as an improper
      claim by court order;
        (7) the affidavit required pursuant to the provisions of paragraph six
      of this subdivision shall be considered  part  of  the  application  for
      benefits pursuant to this section;
        (8) if an eligible tenant has duly filed a notice of claim pursuant to
      paragraph  four  of  this  subdivision  and did not receive a relocation
      award as  provided  herein,  it  may  commence  an  action  against  any
      applicant  who filed a false affidavit pursuant to paragraph six of this
      subdivision or  any  security  posted  by  such  applicant  pursuant  to
      paragraph  five  of this subdivision, within three years of such filing.
      In any action to enforce a claim pursuant to this  subdivision,  if  the
      court finds that the claimant has wilfully exaggerated the amount of the
      claim,  the  claimant may be held liable in damages for an amount not to
      exceed the proper relocation award. An eligible tenant in whose favor  a
      judgment is entered shall be entitled to costs and reasonable legal fees
      and disbursements provided that such judgment is in excess of the amount
      which the applicant or owner offered to pay the eligible tenant;
        (9)  any lease or other rental agreement provision exempting, waiving,
      releasing or discharging  the  obligation  to  pay  a  relocation  award
      pursuant  to this subdivision shall be void as against public policy and
      wholly unenforceable;
        (10) the provisions of this  subdivision  shall  not  apply  south  of
      fifty-ninth street in the county of New York if the zoning resolution of
      the  city  of  New  York  expressly provides for relocation loans and/or
      grants in lieu of the benefits of this subdivision.
    
        aa. Harassment. (1) The provisions of this subdivision  apply  to  and
      are additional requirements for claiming or receiving:
        (a) any tax exemption under this section; or
        (b)   any  tax  abatement  under  this  section  where  the  certified
      reasonable cost per dwelling  unit  of  the  conversion,  alteration  or
      improvement  (including  the  cost  of  any  conversion,  alteration  or
      improvement for which an abatement was approved within four years  prior
      to  commencement  of  the conversion, alteration or improvement) exceeds
      seven thousand five hundred dollars.
        (2) The owner of the  property  shall  file  with  the  department  of
      housing  preservation  and development, not less than thirty days before
      the  commencement  of  the   conversion,   alteration   or   improvement
      (hereinafter referred to as the "cut-off date"), an affidavit, or, where
      any information referred to in paragraph one of this subdivision changes
      prior  to  applying  for  or claiming any benefit under this section, an
      amending affidavit, setting forth the following information:
        (a) every owner of record and owner of a substantial interest  in  the
      property  or  entity  owning  the property or sponsoring the conversion,
      alteration or improvement;
        (b) a statement that none of such persons had, within the  five  years
      prior  to  the  cut-off  date, been found to have harassed or unlawfully
      evicted tenants by judgment  or  determination  of  a  court  or  agency
      (including   a   non-governmental   agency   having   appropriate  legal
      jurisdiction) under the penal law, any state  or  local  law  regulating
      rents  or  any  state  or local law relating to harassment of tenants or
      unlawful eviction; and
        (c) any change in the information required to be set forth.
        (3)  No  conversion,  alteration  or  improvement  subject   to   this
      subdivision  shall  be eligible for tax exemption or tax abatement under
      this section where:
        (a) any affidavit required under this subdivision has not been  filed;
      or
        (b)  any  such  affidavit  contains  a  willful  misrepresentation  or
      omission of any material fact; or
        (c) any person referred to in subparagraph (a)  of  paragraph  two  of
      this  subdivision  has been found to have harassed or unlawfully evicted
      tenants as described in that paragraph, until and unless the finding  is
      reversed  on  appeal,  provided  that any such finding after the cut-off
      date shall not apply to or affect any tax abatement or exemption for the
      conversion, alteration or improvement covered by the affidavit.
        (4) The department of housing preservation  and  development  and  the
      department  of  finance shall maintain a list of affidavits as described
      in paragraph two of this subdivision. Each agency shall review that list
      with respect to each application or claim for benefits subject  to  this
      subdivision.
        (5)  "Substantial  interest"  as used in subparagraph (a) of paragraph
      two of this subdivision shall mean ownership of an interest of  ten  per
      centum  or  more  in  the  property  or  entity  owning  the property or
      sponsoring the conversion, alteration or improvement.
        (6) Where the  conversion,  alteration  or  improvement  is  commenced
      before  August  first,  nineteen  hundred eighty-three, the cut-off date
      shall be as set forth in this subdivision, but  no  affidavit  shall  be
      required  to be filed until thirty days after the effective date of this
      subdivision.
        bb. Notwithstanding any contrary  provision  of  the  private  housing
      finance  law,  the  benefits  of this section shall apply to any limited
      profit housing company  as  provided  in  this  section.  Such  multiple
      dwelling,  building or structure shall be eligible for benefits where at
    
      least one  building-wide  improvement  or  alteration  is  part  of  the
      application   for   benefits.  Furthermore,  to  the  extent  that  such
      alterations or improvements are financed with grants, loans or subsidies
      from  any  federal,  state,  or  local  agency  or instrumentality, such
      multiple dwelling, building or structure shall be eligible for  benefits
      only  if  the  limited profit housing company has entered into a binding
      and irrevocable agreement with the commissioner of housing of the  state
      of  New York, the supervising agency, as such term is defined in section
      two of the private housing  finance  law,  the  New  York  city  housing
      development  corporation,  or  the New York state housing finance agency
      prohibiting the dissolution or reconstitution  of  such  limited  profit
      housing  company  pursuant to section thirty-five of the private housing
      finance law for not less than fifteen years  from  the  commencement  of
      benefits.  The  abatement of taxes on such property, including the land,
      shall not be an amount greater than ninety per centum of  the  certified
      reasonable cost of such alterations or improvements, as determined under
      regulations  of  the department of housing preservation and development,
      nor  greater  than  eight  and  one-third  percent  of  such   certified
      reasonable  cost  in  any twelve month period, nor be effective for more
      than twenty years. The annual abatement of taxes  in  any  twelve  month
      period  shall  in  no  event exceed fifty percent of the amount of taxes
      payable in such twelve month period pursuant to the applicable exemption
      granted pursuant to article two of the private housing  finance  law  or
      other  applicable  laws or fifty percent of payments required to be made
      in lieu of taxes  in  such  twelve  month  period.  Notwithstanding  the
      foregoing, the annual abatement of taxes for alterations or improvements
      commenced  prior  to  June first, nineteen hundred eighty-six may not be
      applied to reduce the amount of taxes payable or the amount of  payments
      required  to  be  made in lieu of taxes in any twelve month period to an
      amount less than the  minimum  amount  of  taxes  required  to  be  paid
      pursuant to section thirty-three of the private housing finance law.
        cc.  The  commissioner  of  the department of housing preservation and
      development and the commissioner of  the  department  of  finance  shall
      prepare  an  annual report which shall be submitted to the Mayor and the
      council on or before the first day of July next succeeding the  year  to
      which  the  report  pertains,  regarding  the  exemptions and abatements
      granted pursuant to this section and shall include, but not  be  limited
      to  the  following information: (i) the amount of real property tax that
      would have been paid in the aggregate by the  owners  of  real  property
      granted an exemption or abatement if the property were fully taxable and
      the  amount  of  tax actually paid in the aggregate by such owners, (ii)
      the  geographic  distribution  of  exemptions  and  abatements   granted
      pursuant  to  this section, and (iii) a distribution by type of eligible
      categories as delineated in paragraphs one through nine of subdivision b
      of this section.
        dd. Partial waiver of rent adjustments attributable to  major  capital
      improvements.  (1)  The  provisions of this subdivision apply to and are
      additional requirements for claiming  or  receiving  any  tax  abatement
      under  this  section, except as provided in paragraphs three and four of
      this subdivision.
        (2) The owner of the  property  shall  file  with  the  department  of
      housing  preservation  and  development, on the date any application for
      benefits is made, a declaration stating that in consideration of any tax
      abatement benefits which may be received pursuant  to  such  application
      for   alterations   or   improvements   constituting   a  major  capital
      improvement, such owner agrees to waive the collection of a  portion  of
      the  total  annual  amount  of  any rent adjustment attributable to such
      major capital improvement which may be granted by  the  New  York  state
    
      division   of  housing  and  community  renewal  pursuant  to  the  rent
      stabilization code equal to one-half of the total annual amount  of  the
      tax  abatement  benefits  which  the  property receives pursuant to such
      application  with  respect  to  such  alterations  or improvements. Such
      waiver shall commence on the date of the first collection of  such  rent
      adjustment, provided that, in the event that such tax abatement benefits
      were received prior to such first collection, the amount waived shall be
      increased  to  account  for  such  tax  abatement  benefits so received.
      Following  the  expiration  of  a  tax  abatement  for  alterations   or
      improvements  constituting  a major capital improvement for which a rent
      adjustment has been granted by such division, the owner may collect  the
      full amount of annual rent permitted pursuant to such rent adjustment. A
      copy of such declaration shall be filed simultaneously with the New York
      state  division of housing and community renewal. Such declaration shall
      be binding upon such owner, and his or her successors and assigns.
        (3) The provisions of this subdivision shall not apply to  substantial
      rehabilitation  of buildings vacant when alterations or improvements are
      commenced or to buildings rehabilitated with the substantial  assistance
      of city, state or federal subsidies.
        (4) The provisions of this subdivision shall apply only to alterations
      and improvements commenced after its effective date.
        ee.  The department of housing preservation and development shall make
      information relating to the provisions of this section available on  the
      department's  website, and shall provide a contact phone number allowing
      tenants to determine benefits available pursuant to  this  section.  The
      department  shall  convene a task force that shall examine and report on
      methods to improve the transparency of the program established  pursuant
      to this section.

Section 11-244 ::    
        
     
        ยง  11-244  Tax exemption and abatement for rehabilitated buildings. a.
      As used in this section, the following terms shall  have  the  following
      meanings:
        1. "Eligible real property" shall mean:
        (i) any class B multiple dwelling;
        (ii)  any  class  A  multiple  dwelling used for single room occupancy
      pursuant to section two hundred forty-eight of the multiple dwelling law
      which contains no more than twenty-five percent class A  dwelling  units
      which contain lawful sanitary and kitchen facilities within the dwelling
      unit,  provided  that  in the case of a multiple dwelling containing ten
      dwelling units or less, up to forty percent of the dwelling units may be
      class A units;
        (iii) not-for-profit institutions with sleeping accommodations.
        Notwithstanding  the  foregoing,  eligible  real  property  shall  not
      include college and school dormitories, club houses, or residences whose
      occupancy is restricted to an institutional use such as housing intended
      for use primarily or exclusively by the employees of a single company or
      institution.  A  building  is  an  eligible  real  property  only  if it
      qualifies as such after completion of  the  eligible  improvements,  but
      need  not  have  been  an  eligible  real property prior to the eligible
      improvements.
        2.  "Eligible  improvements"  shall  be  limited  to   the   following

Section 11-245.3 ::    
        
     
        ยง  11-245.3 Exemption for persons sixty-five years of age or over.  1.
      Real property owned by one or more persons, each of whom  is  sixty-five
      years  of  age or over, or real property owned by husband and wife or by
      siblings, one of whom is sixty-five  years  of  age  or  over,  or  real
      property  owned  by one or more persons, some of whom qualify under this
      section and section 11-245.4 of this part shall be exempt from taxes  on
      real  estate to the extent of fifty per centum of the assessed valuation
      thereof. For the purposes of this section, siblings shall mean a brother
      or a sister, whether related through halfblood, whole blood or adoption.
        2. Exemption from taxation for school purposes shall not be granted in
      the case of real property where a child resides if such child attends  a
      public school of elementary or secondary education.
        3. No exemption shall be granted:
        (a) if the income of the owner or the combined income of the owners of
      the  property  exceeds  the sum of twenty-six thousand dollars beginning
      July first, two thousand six, twenty-seven  thousand  dollars  beginning
      July  first, two thousand seven, twenty-eight thousand dollars beginning
      July  first,  two  thousand  eight,  and  twenty-nine  thousand  dollars
      beginning  July  first,  two  thousand  nine  for  the  income  tax year
      immediately preceding the date  of  making  application  for  exemption.
      Income  tax  year shall mean the twelve month period for which the owner
      or owners filed a federal personal income tax  return,  or  if  no  such
      return  is filed, the calendar year. Where title is vested in either the
      husband or the wife, their combined income  may  not  exceed  such  sum,
      except  where  the  husband  or wife, or ex-husband or ex-wife is absent
      from the property as provided in subparagraph (ii) of paragraph  (d)  of
      this  subdivision,  then  only  the  income  of  the spouse or ex-spouse
      residing on the property shall be considered and  may  not  exceed  such
      sum.  Such income shall include social security and retirement benefits,
      interest, dividends, total gain from the sale or exchange of  a  capital
      asset  which  may  be  offset  by  a loss from the sale or exchange of a
      capital asset in the same income tax year, net rental income, salary  or
      earnings,  and  net  income  from self-employment, but shall not include
      gifts, inheritances, a return of capital, payments made  to  individuals
      because  of  their  status  as victims of Nazi persecution as defined in
      P.L. 103-286, monies earned through employment  in  the  federal  foster
      grandparent  program, and veterans disability compensation as defined in
      title 38 of the United States Code, and any such income shall be  offset
      by  all  medical and prescription drug expenses actually paid which were
      not reimbursed or paid for by insurance. In computing net rental  income
      and  net  income from self-employment no depreciation deduction shall be
      allowed for the exhaustion, wear and tear of real or  personal  property
      held for the production of income.
        (b)  unless  the  title  of the property shall have been vested in the
      owner or one  of  the  owners  of  the  property  for  at  least  twelve
      consecutive   months  prior  to  the  date  of  making  application  for
      exemption, provided, however, that in the event of the death  of  either
      husband  or  wife  in  whose  name title of the property shall have been
      vested at the time of death  and  then  becomes  vested  solely  in  the
      survivor  by virtue of devise by or descent from the deceased husband or
      wife, the time of ownership of the property by the deceased  husband  or
      wife  shall  be deemed also a time of ownership by the survivor and such
      ownership shall be deemed continuous for the purposes of computing  such
      period  of  twelve consecutive months, and provided further, that in the
      event of a transfer by either husband or wife to the other spouse of all
      or part of the title to the property,  the  time  of  ownership  of  the
      property  by  the  transferer  spouse  shall  be  deemed  also a time of
      ownership by the transferee spouse and such ownership  shall  be  deemed
    
      continuous   for  the  purposes  of  computing  such  period  of  twelve
      consecutive months, and provided further, that  where  property  of  the
      owner  or owners has been acquired to replace property formerly owned by
      such  owner  or  owners and taken by eminent domain or other involuntary
      proceeding, except a tax  sale,  and  where  a  residence  is  sold  and
      replaced with another within one year and both are within the state, the
      period  of  ownership  of the former property shall be combined with the
      period of ownership of the property for which application  is  made  for
      exemption   and  such  periods  of  ownership  shall  be  deemed  to  be
      consecutive for purposes of this section.  Where  the  owner  or  owners
      transfer  title  to property which as of the date of transfer was exempt
      from taxation under the provisions of this section, the reacquisition of
      title by such owner or owners within nine months of the date of transfer
      shall be deemed to satisfy the requirement of this  paragraph  that  the
      title  of the property shall have been vested in the owner or one of the
      owners for such period of twelve  consecutive  months.  Where,  upon  or
      subsequent  to  the death of an owner or owners, title to property which
      as of the date of  such  death  was  exempt  from  taxation  under  such
      provisions,  becomes  vested,  by  virtue  of devise or descent from the
      deceased owner or owners, or by transfer by any other means within  nine
      months  after such death, solely in a person or persons who, at the time
      of such death, maintained such property  as  a  primary  residence,  the
      requirement  of this paragraph that the title of the property shall have
      been vested in the owner or one of the owners for such period of  twelve
      consecutive months shall be deemed satisfied;
        (c)  unless the property is used exclusively for residential purposes,
      provided, however, that in the event any portion of such property is not
      so used exclusively for residential  purposes  but  is  used  for  other
      purposes,  such  portion  shall be subject to taxation and the remaining
      portion only shall  be  entitled  to  the  exemption  provided  by  this
      section;
        (d)  unless  the property is the legal residence of and is occupied in
      whole or in part by the owner or by all of the owners of  the  property;
      except  where, (i) an owner is absent from the residence while receiving
      health-related care  as  an  inpatient  of  a  residential  health  care
      facility,  as  defined in section twenty-eight hundred one of the public
      health law, provided that any income accruing to that  person  shall  be
      income only to the extent that it exceeds the amount paid by such owner,
      spouse, or co-owner for care in the facility, and provided further, that
      during  such confinement such property is not occupied by other than the
      spouse or co-owner of such owner; or, (ii) the real property is owned by
      a husband and/or wife, or an ex-husband and/or an ex-wife, and either is
      absent  from  the  residence  due  to  divorce,  legal   separation   or
      abandonment  and  all  other provisions of this section are met provided
      that where an exemption was previously granted when both resided on  the
      property,  then  the  person  remaining  on  the  real property shall be
      sixty-two years of age or over.
        4. Application for such exemption must be made by the owner, or all of
      the owners of the property, on forms prescribed by the state board to be
      furnished by the department of finance and shall furnish the information
      and must be executed in the manner required or prescribed in  such  form
      and  shall be filed in the department of finance in the borough in which
      the real property is located between the fifteenth day  of  January  and
      the  fifteenth day of March. Notwithstanding any other provision of law,
      any person otherwise qualifying under this section shall not  be  denied
      the  exemption  under this section if he or she becomes sixty-five years
      of age  after  the  taxable  status  date  and  on  or  before  December
      thirty-first of the same year.
    
        5.  At  least  sixty  days  prior  to the fifteenth day of January the
      department of  finance  shall  mail  to  each  person  who  was  granted
      exemption  pursuant  to  this section on the latest completed assessment
      roll an application form and a notice  that  such  application  must  be
      filed  between  the  fifteenth  day  of January and the fifteenth day of
      March every two years from the year in which such exemption was  granted
      and be approved in order for the exemption to be granted. The department
      of  finance shall, within three days of the completion and filing of the
      tentative assessment roll, notify by mail any applicant who has included
      with his application at least one self-addressed, prepaid  envelope,  of
      the  approval  or denial of the application; provided, however, where an
      applicant has included two such envelopes,  the  department  of  finance
      shall,  upon  the  filing  of  the  application, send by mail, notice of
      receipt of that application. Where an applicant is entitled to notice of
      denial provided herein, such notice shall state  the  reasons  for  such
      denial  and shall further state that such determination is reviewable in
      a manner provided by law. Failure to mail any such application  form  or
      notices  or the failure of such person to receive any or all of the same
      shall not prevent the levy, collection and enforcement of the payment of
      the taxes on property owned by such person.
        6. Any conviction of having made any willful false  statement  in  the
      application for such exemption shall be punishable by a fine of not more
      than   one  hundred  dollars  and  shall  disqualify  the  applicant  or
      applicants from further exemption for a period of five years.
        7. Notwithstanding the  maximum  income  exemption  eligibility  level
      provided  in subdivision three of this section, an exemption, subject to
      all other provisions of this section, shall be granted as  indicated  in
      the following schedule:

      property owned by husband and wife, one of whom is sixty-five  years  of

      death  of  the  older spouse so long as the surviving spouse is at least
      sixty-two years of age.
        10. a. For the purposes of this section, title to that portion of real
      property owned  by  a  cooperative  apartment  corporation  in  which  a
      tenant-stockholder  of such corporation resides and which is represented
      by his or her share or shares of stock in such corporation as determined
      by its or their proportional relationship to the total outstanding stock
      of the corporation, including that owned by the  corporation,  shall  be
      deemed  to  be vested in such tenant-stockholder. That proportion of the
      assessment  of  real  property  owned   by   a   cooperative   apartment
      corporation, determined by the relationship of such real property vested
      in  such  tenant-stockholder  to  such  entire  parcel and the buildings
      thereon owned by such cooperative apartment corporation  in  which  such
      tenant-stockholder  resides, shall be subject to exemption from taxation
      pursuant to this section and any exemption so granted shall be  credited
      by the department of finance against the assessed valuation of such real
      property; the reduction in real property taxes realized thereby shall be
      credited  by the cooperative apartment corporation against the amount of
      such   taxes   otherwise   payable   by   or    chargeable    to    such
      tenant-stockholder.  Each cooperative apartment corporation shall notify
      each tenant-stockholder in residence thereof of such provisions  as  are
      set forth in this section.
        b.  Notwithstanding  any  other provision of law, a tenant-stockholder
      who resides in a dwelling which is subject to the provisions  of  either
      article  II,  IV,  V or XI of the private housing finance law and who is
      eligible for a rent increase exemption  pursuant  to  chapter  seven  of
    
      title  twenty-six  of  this  code shall not be eligible for an exemption
      pursuant to this subdivision. Notwithstanding  any  other  provision  of
      law,  a tenant-stockholder who resides in a dwelling which is subject to
      the  provisions of either article II, IV, V or XI of the private housing
      finance law and who is  not  eligible  for  a  rent  increase  exemption
      pursuant to chapter seven of title twenty-six of this code but who meets
      the  requirements  for  eligibility  for  an  exemption pursuant to this
      section  shall  be  eligible  for  such  exemption  provided  that  such
      exemption  shall be in an amount determined by multiplying the exemption
      otherwise allowable pursuant to this section  by  a  fraction  having  a
      numerator equal to the amount of real property taxes or payments in lieu
      of  taxes that were paid with respect to such dwelling and a denominator
      equal to the full amount of real property taxes  that  would  have  been
      owed  with respect to such dwelling had it not been granted an exemption
      or abatement of real property taxes pursuant to any  provision  of  law,
      provided,  however,  that  any reduction in real property taxes received
      with respect to  such  dwelling  pursuant  to  chapter  seven  of  title
      twenty-six  of  this  code  or  pursuant  to  this  section shall not be
      considered in calculating such  numerator.  Any  tenant-stockholder  who
      resides in a dwelling which was or continues to be subject to a mortgage
      insured  or  initially  insured  by  the  federal government pursuant to
      section two hundred thirteen of the national housing  act,  as  amended,
      and  who  is  eligible  for  both  a rent increase exemption pursuant to
      chapter seven of title twenty-six of this code and an exemption pursuant
      to this subdivision, may apply for and receive either  a  rent  increase
      exemption  pursuant  to  such  chapter  or an exemption pursuant to this
      subdivision, but not both.
        11. Exemption Option. Notwithstanding any provision of  this  part  to
      the  contrary,  real  property owned by one or more persons where one of
      such owners qualifies for a real property tax exemption pursuant to this
      section or section 11-245.4 of this part, and  another  of  such  owners
      qualifies  for  a  different  tax exemption pursuant to such sections of
      this part as authorized by state law, such owners shall have the  option
      of  choosing  the one exemption which is most beneficial to such owners.
      Such owners shall not be  prohibited  from  taking  one  such  exemption
      solely on the basis that such owners qualify for more than one exemption
      and therefore are not eligible for any exemptions.

        (a) if the income of the owner or the combined income of the owners of
      the property for the income tax year immediately preceding the  date  of
      making  application for exemption exceeds the sum of twenty-six thousand
      dollars beginning July first, two thousand  six,  twenty-seven  thousand
      dollars  beginning July first, two thousand seven, twenty-eight thousand
      dollars beginning  July  first,  two  thousand  eight,  and  twenty-nine
      thousand  dollars  beginning  July  first, two thousand nine. Income tax
      year shall mean the twelve month period for which the  owner  or  owners
      filed  a  federal  personal  income  tax return, or if no such return is
      filed, the calendar year. Where title is vested in either the husband or
      the wife, their combined income may not exceed such  sum,  except  where
      the  husband  or  wife,  or  ex-husband  or  ex-wife  is absent from the
      property due to divorce, legal separation or abandonment, then only  the
      income  of  the  spouse  or  ex-spouse residing on the property shall be
      considered and may not exceed such sum. Such income shall include social
      security and retirement benefits, interest, dividends, total  gain  from
      the  sale  or  exchange of a capital asset which may be offset by a loss
      from the sale or exchange of a capital asset  in  the  same  income  tax
      year,  net  rental  income,  salary  or  earnings,  and  net income from
      self-employment, but shall not  include  a  return  of  capital,  gifts,
      inheritances  or  monies earned through employment in the federal foster
      grandparent program and any such income shall be offset by  all  medical
      and  prescription  drug expenses actually paid which were not reimbursed
      or paid for by insurance. In computing net rental income and net  income
      from  self-employment no depreciation deduction shall be allowed for the
    
      exhaustion, wear and tear of real or  personal  property  held  for  the
      production of income;
        (b)  unless the property is used exclusively for residential purposes,
      provided, however, that in the event any portion of such property is not
      so used exclusively for residential  purposes  but  is  used  for  other
      purposes,  such  portion  shall be subject to taxation and the remaining
      portion only shall  be  entitled  to  the  exemption  provided  by  this
      section;
        (c) unless the real property is the legal residence of and is occupied
      in  whole  or  in part by the disabled person; except where the disabled
      person is absent from the residence while receiving health-related  care
      as  an  inpatient  of  a residential health care facility, as defined in
      section twenty-eight hundred one of the public health law, provided that
      any income accruing to  that  person  shall  be  considered  income  for
      purposes  of  this section only to the extent that it exceeds the amount
      paid by such person or spouse or sibling of such person for care in  the
      facility.
        4.  Application for such exemption must be made annually by the owner,
      or all of the owners of the property, on forms prescribed by  the  state
      board,  and  shall  be filed with the department of finance on or before
      the fifteenth day of March of the appropriate year;  provided,  however,
      proof  of  a  permanent  disability  need  be submitted only in the year
      exemption pursuant to this section is first sought or the disability  is
      first determined to be permanent.
        5.  At  least  sixty  days  prior to the fifteenth day of March of the
      appropriate year, the department of finance shall mail  to  each  person
      who  was  granted  exemption  pursuant  to  this  section  on the latest
      completed assessment roll an application form and  a  notice  that  such
      application must be filed on or before the fifteenth day of March and be
      approved  in  order for the exemption to continue to be granted. Failure
      to mail such application form or the failure of such person  to  receive
      the  same  shall not prevent the levy, collection and enforcement of the
      payment of the taxes on property owned by such person.
        6. Notwithstanding the  maximum  income  exemption  eligibility  level
      provided  in subdivision three of this section, an exemption, subject to

        8. (a) For purposes of this section, title to  that  portion  of  real
      property  owned  by  a  cooperative  apartment  corporation  in  which a
      tenant-stockholder of such corporation resides, and which is represented
      by his or her share or shares of stock in such corporation as determined
      by its or their proportional relationship to the total outstanding stock
      of the corporation, including that owned by the  corporation,  shall  be
      deemed  to  be vested in such tenant-stockholder. That proportion of the
      assessment of such  real  property  owned  by  a  cooperative  apartment
      corporation  determined by the relationship of such real property vested
      in such tenant-stockholder to  such  entire  parcel  and  the  buildings
      thereon  owned  by  such cooperative apartment corporation in which such
      tenant-stockholder resides shall be subject to exemption  from  taxation
      pursuant  to this section and any exemption so granted shall be credited
      by the department of finance against the assessed valuation of such real
      property; the reduction in real property taxes realized thereby shall be
      credited by the cooperative apartment corporation against the amount  of
      such    taxes    otherwise    payable   by   or   chargeable   to   such
      tenant-stockholder.
        (b) Notwithstanding any other provision of law,  a  tenant-stockholder
      who  resides  in a dwelling which is subject to the provisions of either
      article II, IV, V or XI of the private housing finance law shall not  be
      eligible for an exemption pursuant to this subdivision.
    
        9.  Notwithstanding  any  other  provision of law to the contrary, the
      provisions of this section shall apply to real property  held  in  trust
      solely  for  the  benefit  of a person or persons who would otherwise be
      eligible for a real property tax exemption, pursuant to subdivision  one
      of this section, were such person or persons the owner or owners of such
      real property.
        10.  Exemption  Option.  Notwithstanding any provision of this part to
      the contrary, real property owned by one or more persons  where  one  of
      such owners qualifies for a real property tax exemption pursuant to this
      section  or  section  11-245.3  of this part, and another of such owners
      qualifies for a different tax exemption pursuant  to  such  sections  of
      this  part as authorized by state law, such owners shall have the option
      of choosing the one exemption which is most beneficial to  such  owners.
      Such  owners  shall  not  be  prohibited  from taking one such exemption
      solely on the basis that such owners qualify for more than one exemption
      and therefore are not eligible for any exemptions.

Section 11-245.9 ::    
        
     
        ยง  11-245.9  Alternative exemption for veterans; transfer of title. 1.
      Pursuant to subdivision eight of section four hundred  fifty-eight-a  of
      the real property tax law, where a veteran, the spouse of the veteran or
      unremarried  surviving spouse already receiving an exemption pursuant to
      such section sells the property receiving such exemption  and  purchases
      property  within  the city, the department of finance shall transfer and
      prorate, for the remainder of the fiscal year, the  exemption  received.
      The  prorated  exemption  shall  be based upon the date the veteran, the
      spouse of the veteran or unremarried surviving spouse obtains  title  to
      the new property and shall be calculated by multiplying the tax rate for
      which taxes were levied, on the appropriate tax roll used for the fiscal
      year  during  which  the transfer occurred, multiplied by the previously
      granted exempt amount, multiplied by the fraction of  each  fiscal  year
      remaining subsequent to the transfer of title.
        2.   Nothing  in  this  section  shall  be  construed  to  remove  the
      requirement that  any  such  veteran,  the  spouse  of  the  veteran  or
      unremarried  surviving  spouse  transferring  an  exemption  pursuant to
      subdivision  one  of  this  section  shall  reapply  for  the  exemption
      authorized  pursuant  to  section four hundred fifty-eight-a of the real
      property tax law on or before the following taxable status date, in  the
      event  such  veteran, the spouse of the veteran or unremarried surviving
      spouse wishes to receive the exemption in future fiscal years.
