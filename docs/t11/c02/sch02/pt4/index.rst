        (3)(a)  A  recipient  who  filed  an  application for a certificate of
      eligibility for industrial construction work in any area of such city on
      or after July 1, 1995, and who, following the  effective  date  of  such
      certificate  of  eligibility,  both  commenced  and completed such work,
      shall  be  eligible  for an abatement of real property taxes as follows:
      for the first tax year immediately following completion  of  such  work,
      and  for  the second, third and fourth tax years following completion of
      such work, the abatement shall  equal  fifty  per  centum  of  the  real
      property  tax  that  was imposed on the property which is the subject of
      the certificate of eligibility for the tax  year  immediately  preceding
      the  effective  date  of  such  certificate  of  eligibility,  provided,
      however, that if such property was fully or partially exempt  from  real
      property  taxes  during  such  tax  year, then the abatement shall equal
      fifty per centum of the real property tax that would have  been  imposed
      on  such  property but for such full or partial exemption. For the fifth
      and sixth tax years, the abatement shall equal forty per centum of  such
      amount;  for the seventh and eighth tax years, the abatement shall equal
      thirty per centum of such amount; for the ninth and tenth tax years, the
      abatement shall equal twenty per centum of  such  amount;  and  for  the
      eleventh and twelfth tax years, the abatement shall equal ten per centum
      of  such  amount.  Notwithstanding  any  inconsistent  provision of this
      paragraph, a recipient shall not be eligible for an  abatement  for  the
      first  tax  year following completion of such work, unless the recipient
      submits proof satisfactory to the department of finance that  such  work
      was  completed  on  or before the taxable status date for such first tax
      year no later than thirty days after such taxable status date. Where the
      recipient fails to submit such proof in accordance  with  the  foregoing
      sentence,  a  recipient shall not be eligible for an abatement until the
      second tax year following completion of  such  work.  In  such  case,  a
      recipient  shall  submit proof satisfactory to the department of finance
      that such work was completed on or before the taxable  status  date  for
      such  first  tax year no later than thirty days after the taxable status
      date for such second tax year. A recipient whose abatement begins in the
      second tax year following completion of such work shall not thereby have
      his or her twelve-year benefit period shortened.
        The following table shall illustrate the computation of the  abatement
      for industrial construction work pursuant to this paragraph:
     
              Tax year following completion
              of industrial construction
              work:                               Amount of abatement:
              1 ...................................................50%
              2 ...................................................50%
              3 ...................................................50%
              4 ...................................................50%
              5 ...................................................40%
              6 ...................................................40%

              9 ...................................................20%
              10 ..................................................20%
              11 ..................................................10%
              12 ..................................................10%
     
        (b)  If,  due  to  a determination of the department of finance or tax
      commission of such city or a court, the real  property  tax  imposed  on
      such  property for the tax year immediately preceding the effective date
      of such certificate of eligibility is changed, then any  abatement  that
    
      was  granted  in  accordance with this paragraph prior to such reduction
      shall be recalculated and any abatement to be granted in accordance with
      this paragraph shall be based on the real property tax imposed  on  such
      property  for  the  tax year immediately preceding the effective date of
      such certificate of eligibility, as changed by such  determination.  The
      amount  equal  to the difference between the abatement orginally granted
      and the abatement as so recalculated shall be deducted from  any  refund
      otherwise payable or remission otherwise due as a result of a change due
      to  such  determination, and any balance of such amount remaining unpaid
      after making any such deduction shall  be  paid  to  the  department  of
      finance within thirty days from the date of mailing by the department of
      finance  of  a  notice  of the amount payable. Such amount payable shall
      constitute a tax lien on such property as of the  date  of  such  notice
      and,  if not paid within such thirty-day period, penalty and interest at
      the rate applicable to  delinquent  taxes  on  such  property  shall  be
      charged and collected on such amount from the date of such notice to the
      date of payment.
        (c)  No  property which is the subject of a certificate of eligibility
      pursuant to this part shall receive more than one abatement pursuant  to
      this  part  and  no  abatement  shall exceed one consecutive twelve-year
      period as specified in subparagraph (a) of this paragraph.
        (d) In no event shall an  abatement  granted  pursuant  to  this  part
      exceed  in  any tax year the real property taxes imposed on the property
      which is the subject of a certificate of eligibility  pursuant  to  this
      part.
        (e) For the purpose of calculating an abatement of real property taxes
      pursuant  to  this part, where a tax lot contains more than one building
      or structure and not all of the buildings or structures comprising  such
      tax  lot  are the subject of a certificate of eligibility for industrial
      construction work pursuant to this part, the real property taxes imposed
      on such tax lot for the year immediately preceding the effective date of
      such  certificate  of  eligibility  shall  be  apportioned   among   the
      buildings,  structures  and  land  comprising such tax lot and only such
      real property taxes as are  allocable  to  the  property  which  is  the
      subject of the certificate of eligibility pursuant to this part shall be
      abated in accordance with this paragraph. Such apportionment shall be in
      accordance with rules promulgated by the department of finance.
        (f)  A  recipient  who  filed  an  application  for  a  certificate of
      eligibility  for  industrial  construction  work   in   the   commercial

      following the effective date of such certificate  of  eligibility,  both
      commenced and completed such work, shall be eligible for an abatement of
      real  property  taxes  in  accordance  with  subparagraph  (a)  of  this
      paragraph, provided, however, that where the total net square footage of
      the industrial property used or immediately available and held  out  for
      use  for manufacturing activities involving the assembly of goods or the
      fabrication or processing of raw materials is less than seventy-five per
      centum of the total net square footage of the industrial  property,  the
      abatement  of real property taxes shall be determined in accordance with
      rules promulgated by the  department  of  finance.  Notwithstanding  the
      foregoing  sentence,  no such abatement shall be allowed where the total
      net square footage  of  the  industrial  property  used  or  immediately
      available  and  held out for use for such manufacturing activities after
      completion of industrial construction work is less than  the  total  net
      square  footage  used  or immediately available and held out for use for
      such  manufacturing  activities  before   the   commencement   of   such
      construction  work.  For  purposes  of  this subparagraph only, the term
      "industrial   construction   work"   shall   mean   the   modernization,
    
      rehabilitation,  expansion  or  improvement  of  an existing building or
      structure for use  as  industrial  property  and  the  term  "industrial
      property"  shall  mean nonresidential property on which will exist after
      completion  of  industrial  construction  work  a  building or structure
      wherein at least twenty-five per centum of the total net square  footage
      is  used or immediately available and held out for use for manufacturing
      activities involving  the  assembly  of  goods  or  the  fabrication  or
      processing of raw materials.

      provided, however, that the total compensation paid to any  such  member
      shall  not  exceed  twelve  hundred  dollars  for  any  calendar year. A
      majority of members of such commission entitled  to  vote  on  a  matter
      shall  constitute  a  quorum  for such issue. Decisions shall be made by
      majority vote of those present entitled to vote on a matter.
        b. (1) The commission  shall  meet  in  nineteen  hundred  ninety-two,
      nineteen   hundred  ninety-five  and  nineteen  hundred  ninety-nine  to
      determine the boundaries of the various areas which it is authorized  to
      designate  pursuant  to  this  section.  The  areas  designated  by  the
      commission in effect  as  of  December  thirty-first,  nineteen  hundred
      ninety-one  shall  remain  in effect until the first taxable status date
      after the city council approves a new designation pursuant to  paragraph
      (4) of this subdivision.
        (2)  Not  later  than  October first of each year when areas are to be
      designated, the commission shall publish notice of  proposed  boundaries
      of areas to be designated, and the date, not earlier than five nor later
      than fifteen days following the publication of such notice, on which the
      commission  will hold a public hearing to hear all persons interested in
      the designation of areas. The notice required by this paragraph shall be
      published in the City Record and a newspaper of general  circulation  in
      the  city,  and copies thereof shall be forwarded to each council member
      and community board.
        (3) The commission shall make such designation, and  notify  the  city
      council  of such designation, not later than November first of each year
      when areas are to be designated. The designation shall be  effective  as
      provided in paragraph (4) of this subdivision.
        (4)  Within  thirty  days  after  the first stated meeting of the city
      council following the receipt of notice of such  designation,  the  city
      council  may,  by majority vote, disapprove such designation. If, within
      such thirty-day period, the city council fails to act or fails to act by
      the required vote, the city council shall be  deemed  to  have  approved
      such  designation.  Such  designation shall be effective as of the first
      taxable status date after the city council approves such designation and
      shall remain in effect until the first taxable  status  date  after  the
      city council approves a new designation pursuant to this paragraph.
        c. (1) The commission may designate any area other than the area lying
      south  of  the  center  line  of  ninety-sixth  street in the borough of
      Manhattan to be a special exemption area if it  determines  that  market
      conditions  in  the  area  are  such  that the availability of a special
    
      exemption is required in order to encourage commercial construction work
      in such  area.  In  making  such  determination,  the  commission  shall
      consider,  among  other factors, the existence in such area of a special
      need  for  commercial  and  job development, high unemployment, economic
      distress or unusually large numbers of vacant, underutilized, unsuitable
      or   substandard   structures,   or   other   substandard,   unsanitary,
      deteriorated  or  deteriorating  conditions,  with  or  without tangible
      blight.
        (2) Any area in the city, other than  the  area  lying  south  of  the
      center  line  of  ninety-sixth  street,  which  the  commission  has not
      designated as a special exemption area  shall  be  a  regular  exemption
      area.
        (3)  On  or  after January 1, 1992, the commission shall not designate
      any area to be either a deferral area or an excluded area, nor shall the
      commission make any new designation in any urban renewal area designated
      pursuant to Article 15 of the General Municipal Law so as to reduce  the
      level of benefits available pursuant to this title in such area.
        (4)  Notwithstanding any other provision of this part, any area in the
      city of New York designated as an empire zone in accordance with article
      eighteen-b of the general municipal law, which the  commission  has  not
      designated  as  a  special  exemption area, shall be a special exemption
      area as of July 1, 1995 or as of the date of  the  designation  of  such
      area as an empire zone, whichever is later.

      exemption  area specified in subparagraph (a) or (c) of paragraph (4) of

      minimum  required  expenditure  applicable  to  any   recipient   of   a
      certificate  of  eligibility for construction work on a condominium unit
      shall be equal to  the  minimum  expenditure  which  would  apply  if  a
      certificate  of  eligibility  were  issued  for construction work on the
      entire property where such unit is located. Nothing in this  subdivision
      shall  be  construed  to prevent owners of condominium units in the same
      property from forming an association to be a recipient. This subdivision
    
      shall not apply to any applicant whose property would be,  or  recipient
      whose  property  is, the subject of a certificate of eligibility with an

      applicant's architect, contractor or other representative authorized  to
      file  the application for such building permit files with the department
      of  finance  on  behalf  of  the  applicant  a  preliminary  application
      containing such information as the department of finance shall prescribe

      permit for such work was  issued  before  such  application  was  filed,
      provided that such permit was not issued before January 1, 1990 or after
      June  30,  1992,  and provided further that a final application is filed

      eligibility to such an applicant upon  determining  that  the  applicant
      satisfies  all  other  requirements  of this part. The effective date of
      such certificate shall be the date of acceptance by  the  department  of
      finance of a final application containing such information as prescribed
      by  rule of the department of finance. No benefits pursuant to this part
      shall be granted for construction work performed  before  the  effective

      of  whether  a  building  permit  for  such  work was issued before such
      application was filed, provided that such permit was not  issued  before
      February 1, 1995, and provided further that a final application is filed

      such certificate shall be the date of acceptance by  the  department  of
      finance of a final application containing such information as prescribed
      by  rule of the department of finance. No benefits pursuant to this part
      shall be granted for construction work performed  before  the  effective

      expiration  of  the  benefit  period,  uses  such property as commercial
      property, shall cease to be eligible for further exemption or  abatement
      for  industrial  construction  work  as  of  the last date to which such
      recipient proves by clear and convincing evidence that such property was
      used as industrial property, and shall pay with interest any  taxes  for
      which  an  exemption  or  abatement  was claimed after such date, except
      that:
        (1) a  recipient  of  a  certificate  of  eligibility  for  industrial
      construction  work  in  a  special  exemption  area  who would have been
      eligible  to  receive  a  certificate  of  eligibility  for   commercial
      construction  work at the time such recipient applied for benefits shall
      continue to receive an exemption for industrial construction; and
        (2) a  recipient  of  a  certificate  of  eligibility  for  industrial
      construction  work  in  a  regular  exemption  area  who would have been
      eligible  to  receive  a  certificate  of  eligibility  for   commercial
      construction work at the time such recipient applied for benefits shall,
      commencing  with  the  date  of  conversion  to  commercial property and
      continuing until the expiration of the  benefit  period  for  commercial
      construction work, receive any exemption which such recipient would have
      received  in  the  corresponding  tax  year pursuant to a certificate of
      eligibility for commercial construction work; and
        (3) a  recipient  of  a  certificate  of  eligibility  for  industrial
      construction  work  in  any  area of the city on whose property at least
      sixty-five per centum of the net square footage continues to be used  or
      held  out  for  use  for  manufacturing  activities  after conversion to
      commercial property, shall not be required to pay the pro rata share  of
      tax for which an exemption was claimed during the tax year in which such
      conversion occurred.
        c.  Except as provided in subdivision d of this section, any recipient
      whose property is the  subject  of  a  certificate  of  eligibility  for
      commercial,  industrial  or  renovation  construction work, and who uses
      such property as residential property or  for  any  restricted  activity
      prior  to  the  expiration  of  the  benefit  period,  shall cease to be
      eligible for further exemption, abatement or deferral  as  of  the  date
      such  property  was  first  used  as  residential  property  or  for any
      restricted activity. In the  case  of  property  in  an  area  that  was
      designated  as  an  exemption  area  at  the  time  the  certificate  of
      eligibility was issued, such recipient shall pay with interest any taxes
      for which an exemption was claimed after such date,  including  the  pro
      rata  share  of  tax  for which any exemption was claimed during the tax
      year in which such use occurred. In the  case  of  industrial  property,
      such  recipient shall pay with interest any taxes for which an exemption
      or abatement was claimed after such date, including the pro  rata  share
      of  tax  for which any exemption or abatement was claimed during the tax
      year in which such use occurred. In the case of property in an area that
      was designated as a  deferral  area  at  the  time  the  certificate  of
      eligibility  was issued, all deferred tax payments on the property shall
      become due and payable immediately.
        d. Notwithstanding subdivision c of this section, any recipient  whose
      property  is  the subject of a certificate of eligibility for commercial
    
      or renovation construction work with an effective date of July  1,  1992
      or after, and who, prior to the expiration of the benefit period, uses a
      portion  of  such  property  as  residential property, shall cease to be
      eligible for further exemption for commercial or renovation construction
      work  for  that portion of such property used as residential property as
      of the date such portion of the property was first used  as  residential
      property.  Such  recipient shall pay, with interest, any taxes for which
      an exemption was claimed after such date attributable to that portion of
      the property used as residential property, including the pro rata  share
      of tax for which such exemption was claimed during the tax year in which
      such use occurred. Such recipient shall continue to receive an exemption
      for  commercial  or renovation construction work for that portion of the
      property which continues to be used as commercial property.

      a.  The  department  of  finance  may  deny,  reduce, suspend, revoke or
      terminate any exemption from or abatement or deferral  of  tax  payments
      pursuant to this part whenever:
        (1)  a recipient fails to comply with the requirements of this part or
      the rules and regulations  promulgated  by  the  department  of  finance
      pursuant thereto; or
        (2) an application, certificate, report or other document delivered by
      an  applicant  or  recipient  hereunder  contains  a false or misleading
      statement as to a material fact or omits  to  state  any  material  fact
      necessary  in  order  to  make  the  statements  therein  not  false  or
      misleading, and may declare any applicant or recipient  who  makes  such
      false  or  misleading  statement or omission to be ineligible for future
      exemption, abatement or deferral pursuant to this part for the  same  or
      other property.
        b. Notwithstanding any other law to the contrary, a recipient shall be
      personally liable for any taxes owed pursuant to this part whenever such
      recipient fails to comply with such law and rules or makes such false or
      misleading   statement  or  omission,  and  the  department  of  finance
      determines that such act was due to the recipient's willful neglect,  or
      that  under  the  circumstances  such  act  constituted  a  fraud on the
      department of finance or a buyer or prospective buyer of  the  property.
      The  remedy  provided  herein  for  an  action  in  personam shall be in
      addition to any  other  remedy  or  procedure  for  the  enforcement  of

      otherwise relieve or indemnify the recipient from any personal liability
      arising hereunder, shall be void as against public policy  except  where
      the  imposition  of  such taxes or liability is occasioned by actions of
      the tenant in violation of the lease.

      the environmental control board  with  respect  to  matters  within  its
      jurisdiction,  finds  that  at  the  property  which is the subject of a
      certificate of eligibility there has been a  violation  of  any  of  the
      provisions  of  the  building,  fire and air pollution control codes set
      forth in subdivision b of this section, all benefits  pursuant  to  such
      certificate  shall  be  suspended  unless within one hundred eighty days
      after the department of finance has sent notice of such finding  to  the
      recipient,  and  all  other  persons  having a financial interest in the
      property who have filed a timely request for such notice in such form as
      may be prescribed by the department of finance, the recipient submits to

      continue until the recipient submits to the department  of  finance  the
      required certification that the violation has been cured.
        If the original finding of violation or the denial of certification is
      appealed   and  a  court  or  appropriate  governmental  agency  finally
      determines that the finding of violation or denial of certification  was
      invalid,  any  benefits  lost  pursuant  to  this  section  to which the
      recipient was entitled shall be restored retroactively.
        As applied to a recipient who is eligible for deferral of tax payments
      pursuant to subdivision d of section 11-257 of this part, suspension  of
      benefits  shall be deferred by operation of such section and interest at
      the rate charged by the department of finance for overdue taxes shall be
      charged on the amount of any tax payments already deferred by  operation
      of such section. The interest charged shall accrue from the beginning of
      the period of suspension.
        b.  The  provisions  of  subdivision  a of this section shall apply to
      violations of the following provision of the code:
        (1) section 27-4260;
