Section 11-203 ::    
        
     
        §  11-203 Maps and records; tax maps. a. As used in the charter and in
      the code, the term "tax maps" shall mean and include the  block  map  of
      taxes  and  assessments to the extent that the territory within the city
      of New York is or shall be embraced in such map, such ward or land  maps
      as  embrace  the  remainder  of  such city, and also such maps as may be
      prepared under and pursuant to subdivision d of this section.
        b. Each separately assessed parcel shall be indicated on the tax  maps
      by   a  parcel  number  or  by  an  identification  number.  A  separate
      identification number shall be entered upon the tax maps in such  manner
      as  clearly to indicate each separately assessed parcel of real property
      not indicated by parcel numbering. Real property indicated by  a  single
      identification  number  shall  be  deemed  to  be  a separately assessed
      parcel.
        In the case of a newly created parcel with any  building  thereon,  no
      tax lot number or identification number shall be assigned to such parcel
      unless  the  commissioner  of  the department of buildings has certified
      that the newly created parcel complies with all applicable zoning laws.
        c. Parcel numbers shall designate each parcel by the use of  three  or
      more  numbers, of which one shall be a section or ward number, another a
      block, district or plat number, and another a lot number. The department
      of finance may from time to time change the  form  of  the  section  and
      blocks,  and  also  the  numbers  thereof,  on the tax maps filed in its
      office whenever such change of form has been caused pursuant to  section
      one  hundred  ninety-nine  of the charter, and there shall thereafter be
      delineated and entered upon such maps such new additional  sections  and
      blocks  and  their numbers as necessity may require. Such administration
      may from time to time change the form of the lots or  parcels  comprised
      within any block, and also the numbers thereof, and cause to be shown on
      such  maps  the  separate  lots  or parcels of land contained in any new
      block added thereto and also the lots numbers thereof, according to  the
      general plan employed in the making of such maps.
        d.  Each  separately  assessed  parcel  indicated by an identification
      number shall be shown by a description, or by inscription of such number
      on the block  map  of  taxes  and  assessments,  or  by  other  map  and
      description.  Such numbers may be altered in the same manner as provided
      in the preceding subdivision for the alteration of parcel numbers.
        e.  New  tax  maps shall be certified by the department of finance and
      filed in its main office, and substituted for use in its offices and  in
      those of the department of environmental protection with respect to maps
      affecting the boroughs of Manhattan, Bronx, Brooklyn and Queens, instead
      of the maps theretofore in use therein. All changes and alterations made
      in  the  tax  maps  shall  be  transmitted within thirty days after such
      change or alteration to such offices.
        f.  On  or  before  July  first,  nineteen  hundred  sixty-four,   the
      department of finance:
        (i)  Shall  certify  and file a map showing the boundaries of each and
      every tax block and its tax block number in the boroughs  of  Manhattan,
      Bronx,  Brooklyn and Queens, with the city register, and with the clerks
      of the counties of New York, Bronx, Kings and Queens,
        (ii) Shall certify and file a copy  of  the  tax  maps  for  the  year
      nineteen   hundred   sixty-four--nineteen  hundred  sixty-five  for  the
      boroughs  of  Manhattan,  Bronx,  Brooklyn  and  Queens  with  the  city
      register, and
        (iii)  Shall, not later than July first, nineteen hundred sixty-seven,
      certify and file a copy of the tax maps for the  year  nineteen  hundred
      sixty-seven--nineteen hundred sixty-eight for the boroughs of Manhattan,
      Bronx,  Brooklyn and Queens respectively with the clerks of the counties
      of New York, Bronx, Kings and Queens. All changes and  alterations  made
    
      in  the  block  boundary  maps  and in the tax maps shall be transmitted
      within thirty days after such change or alteration to such county clerks
      and city register.

Section 11-204 ::    
        
     
        §  11-204  Tax maps; block references; alterations and corrections. a.
      On and after July first, nineteen hundred sixty-four,  the  use  of  the
      land  maps in the offices of the city register and in the offices of the
      clerks of the counties of New York, Bronx, Kings and  Queens,  shall  be
      discontinued,  and on and after July first, nineteen hundred sixty-four,
      reference shall be had to the tax maps for the  boroughs  of  Manhattan,
      Bronx,  Brooklyn  and Queens and to block numbers designated thereon for
      the purpose of indexing, recording or filing  of  instruments  affecting
      title or relating to real property in such counties and the tax maps for
      said boroughs shall be conclusive as to the location of block boundaries
      and  block  numbers.  The tax map for each borough may be referred to as
      the land map for the particular county which it affects.
        b. Whenever any block boundaries  shall  be  changed  or  any  new  or
      additional  blocks  of  land  shall  be  formed  in such counties by the
      opening or closing of any street, avenue, road, boulevard or parkway  or
      otherwise, the department of finance shall cause such maps to be altered
      to  show  the  changes in the boundaries of a block and the formation of
      such new or additional blocks, and to cause such blocks, the  boundaries
      of  which  have  been  altered, and such new or additional blocks, to be
      numbered on such maps with such block numbers  as  such  department  may
      determine. The commissioner of finance, or an officer or employee of the
      department  designated  by  the  commissioner,  shall  certify  and file
      annually with the register and county clerk in each of such  counties  a
      list  of  the  numbers  of the blocks, the boundaries of which have been
      altered, and a list of the numbers of new  or  additional  blocks  which
      have been formed.
        c.  For  the  purpose of notice under any of the provisions of law for
      the recording of instruments affecting  or  relating  to  land  in  such
      counties,  each  block  shall be deemed to extend to the middle lines of
      the streets, avenue, roads and boulevards laid out  on  such  land  maps
      fronting and adjoining such block, and shall also be deemed to extend to
      the  exterior  bulkhead  line  or to the exterior line of grants of land
      under water where water forms one of the boundaries of a block.
        d. The word "block", as used in this  section  designates  a  plot  or
      parcel  of  land  such  as is commonly so designated in the city, wholly
      embraced  within  the  continuous  lines  of  streets,  or  streets  and
      waterfront  taken  together where water forms one of the boundaries of a
      block, and such other parcels of land or land  under  water  as  may  be
      indicated  by  the  department  of  finance  upon such tax maps by block
      numbers as constituting blocks.

      finance  as  may  be  most  convenient  to the taxpayers of the city and
      suitable to the proper discharge of the business of  the  department  of
      finance.  They shall be public records and shall at all reasonable times
      be open to public inspection.
        b. Copies of all such records and transcripts  thereof,  certified  by
      the  commissioner of finance or an assessor or by an officer or employee
      of the department of finance designated by the commissioner of  finance,
      and  under the seal of the department of finance, shall be admissible in
      evidence in all courts and places in the same manner and  for  the  same
      purposes  as  books,  papers or documents similarly authenticated by the
      clerk of a county.

Section 11-206 ::    
        
     
        §  11-206  Power of the commissioner of finance to correct errors. The
      commissioner of finance may correct  any  assessment  or  tax  which  is
      erroneous  due  to  a  clerical  error  or  to  an  error of description
      contained in the several books of annual record of assessed  valuations,
      or  in  the  assessments-rolls.  If the taxes computed on such erroneous
      assessment have been paid, the commissioner of finance is authorized  to
      refund  or  credit  the  difference  between  the  taxes computed on the
      erroneous and corrected assessments.

Section 11-207 ::    
        
     
        §  11-207  Duties of assessors in assessing property. a. In performing
      their assessment duties, the assessors  shall  personally  examine  each
      parcel  of  taxable  real  estate during at least every third assessment
      cycle, and shall personally examine each parcel of real estate  that  is
      not  taxable  during  at least every fifth assessment cycle, as measured
      from the last preceding assessment cycle during which  such  parcel  was
      personally  examined. Notwithstanding anything in the preceding sentence
      to the contrary, the assessors shall revalue,  reassess  or  update  the
      assessment  of  each  parcel of taxable or nontaxable real estate during
      each  assessment  cycle,  irrespective  of  whether  such   parcel   was
      personally examined during each assessment cycle.
        b.  The  persons having charge of the borough assessment offices shall
      furnish to the commissioner of finance, under oath, a detailed statement
      of all taxable real estate in the city. Such statement shall contain the
      street, the section or ward, the block and lot and map or identification
      numbers of such real estate embraced within such district; the  sum  for
      which, in their judgment, each separately assessed parcel of real estate
      would  sell  under  ordinary  circumstances if it were wholly unimproved
      and, separately stated, the sum for which the  same  parcel  would  sell
      under  ordinary  circumstances  with  the improvements, if any, thereon,
      such sums to be determined with regard to the limitations  contained  in
      the state real property tax law. Such statement shall include such other
      information  as  the  commissioner  of  finance  may, from time to time,
      require.

Section 11-208.1
----------------

Section 11-208.1 ::    
        
     
        §  11-208.1  Income and expense statements.  a. Where real property is
      income-producing  property,  the  owner  shall  be  required  to  submit
      annually  to  the  department  not  later  than the first day of June, a
      statement of all income derived from and all  expenses  attributable  to
      the operation of such property as follows:
        (1)  Where  the  owner's books and records reflecting the operation of
      the property are maintained on a  calendar  year  basis,  the  statement
      shall be for the calendar year preceding the date the statement shall be
      filed.
        (2)  Where  the  owner's books and records reflecting the operation of
      the property are maintained on a fiscal year basis  for  federal  income
      tax  purposes, the statement shall be for the last fiscal year concluded
      as of the first day of May preceding the date  the  statement  shall  be
      filed.
        (3)  Notwithstanding  the provisions of paragraphs one and two of this
      subdivision, where the owner  of  the  property  has  not  operated  the
      property  and  is  without  knowledge  of the income and expenses of the
      operation of the property for the entire year for which the  income  and
      expense  statement  is  required pursuant to the provisions of paragraph
      one or paragraph two of this subdivision, then  an  income  and  expense
      statement  shall  not be required for such year. Such owner is, however,
      subject to the requirements of paragraph four of subdivision d  of  this
      section.
        (4)  The  commissioner  may  for  good cause shown extend the time for
      filing an income and expense statement by a period not to exceed  thirty
      days,  or  in  the  case of residential class two properties held in the
      cooperative or condominium form of ownership, by a period not to  exceed
      sixty  days.  The  filing of the income and expense statement within the
      time prescribed by this paragraph shall be considered timely filed.
        b. Such statements shall contain the following declaration: "I certify
      that all information contained in this statement is true and correct  to
      the  best  of  my  knowledge  and  belief. I understand that the willful
      making of any false statement of material fact herein will subject me to
      the provisions of law  relevant  to  the  making  and  filing  of  false
      instruments and will render this statement null and void."
        c.  The  form  on  which  such  statement  shall be submitted shall be
      prepared by the commissioner and copies  of  such  form  shall  be  made
      available  at  the  offices of the department in the county in which the
      property is  located.  The  commissioner  may,  by  rule,  require  such
      statement to be submitted electronically in such form and such manner as
      the  commissioner  may  determine.  For good cause, the commissioner may
      waive any rule requiring electronic filing and may permit a statement to
      be filed in such other manner as the commissioner may designate.
        d. (1) In the event that an owner of income-producing  property  fails
      to  file  an  income and expense statement within the time prescribed in
      subdivision a of this section (determined with regard to  any  extension
      of  time  for  filing),  such  owner shall be subject to a penalty in an
      amount not to exceed  three  percent  of  the  assessed  value  of  such
      income-producing  property  determined  for  the  current fiscal year in
      accordance with section fifteen hundred six  of  the  charter  provided,
      however,  that if such statement is not filed by the thirty-first day of
      December, the penalty shall be in an amount not to exceed  four  percent
      of  such  assessed value. If, in the year immediately following the year
      in which an owner fails to file by the  thirty-first  of  December,  the
      owner  again  fails  to  file an income and expense statement within the
      time prescribed in subdivision a of this section (determined with regard
      to any extension of time for filing), such owner shall be subject  to  a
      penalty in an amount not to exceed five percent of the assessed value of
    
      such  property  determined for the current fiscal year. Such owner shall
      also be subject to a penalty of up to  five  percent  of  such  assessed
      value in any year immediately succeeding a year in which a penalty of up
      to  five percent could have been imposed, if in such succeeding year the
      owner fails to file an income and  expense  statement  within  the  time
      prescribed  in  subdivision a of this section (determined with regard to
      any extension of time for filing).  The  penalties  prescribed  in  this
      paragraph  shall  be  imposed  by  the  commissioner after notice and an
      opportunity to be heard, and an opportunity to cure the failure to file.
      The penalties prescribed in this paragraph  shall  be  a  lien  on  such
      income-producing  property  when  entered  by  the  commissioner  in the
      records in which charges against the property are  to  be  entered,  and
      shall  continue  to  be,  until paid, a lien on such property. Such lien
      shall be a tax lien within the meaning of sections 11-319 and 11-401  of
      this  code  and  may  be  collected, sold, enforced or foreclosed in the
      manner provided in chapters two, three and four of title eleven of  this
      code  or  may  be satisfied in accordance with the provisions of section
      thirteen hundred fifty-four of the real property actions and proceedings
      law. If any such penalties are not paid within thirty days from the date
      of entry, it shall be the duty of the commissioner to  receive  interest
      thereon  at  the  rate  of  interest  applicable  to such property for a
      delinquent tax on real property, to be calculated to the date of payment
      from the date of entry. The penalties prescribed in this  paragraph  may
      also  be  collected  in  an  action  brought  against  the  owner of the
      income-producing property in a  court  of  competent  jurisdiction.  The
      institution  of  any  such  action shall not suspend or bar the right to
      pursue any other remedy  provided  by  law  for  the  recovery  of  such
      penalties.
        (2)  The  tax  commission shall deny a hearing on any objection to the
      assessment of property for which an  income  and  expense  statement  is
      required and has not been timely filed.
        (3)   Where  an  income  and  expense  statement  required  under  the
      provisions of this section has not been timely filed,  the  commissioner
      may  compel  by  subpoena the production of the books and records of the
      owner relevant to the income and expenses of the property, and may  also
      make  application  to  any  court of competent jurisdiction for an order
      compelling  the  owner  to  furnish  the  required  income  and  expense
      statement.
        (4)  An owner of real property who is not required to submit an income
      and expense statement pursuant to paragraph three of  subdivision  a  of
      this  section  or  the  rules promulgated by the commissioner of finance
      pursuant  to  subdivision  g  of  this  section  shall  submit  to   the
      department,  annually  on  or  before  the first day of June, or on such
      other schedule as determined by rule of the  commissioner,  a  claim  of
      exclusion  from  the  filing  requirement  in  a  form  approved  by the
      commissioner. The commissioner may for good cause shown extend the  time
      for  submitting  a  claim  of exclusion by a period not to exceed thirty
      days, or in the case of residential class two  properties  held  in  the
      cooperative  or condominium form of ownership, by a period not to exceed
      sixty days. The filing  of  the  claim  of  exclusion  within  the  time
      prescribed  by  this  paragraph shall be considered timely filed. In the
      event that an owner who is required to submit a claim of exclusion fails
      to submit such claim within the time prescribed by this paragraph or  by
      the rules of the commissioner, such owner shall be subject to a penalty.
      Such  penalty  shall  be imposed by the commissioner after notice and an
      opportunity to be heard, and an  opportunity  to  cure  the  failure  to
      submit  a  claim  of  exclusion,  and  shall  be collected and enforced,
      including the imposition of interest  for  late  payment,  in  the  same
    
      manner  as  the  penalties  for  failure  to  file an income and expense
      statement as provided in paragraph one of this subdivision. Such penalty
      shall not exceed the following amounts:
        (i)  one hundred dollars for failure to submit a claim of exclusion in
      one year;
        (ii) five hundred dollars for failure to submit a claim  of  exclusion
      in two consecutive years;
        (iii)  one thousand dollars for failure to submit a claim of exclusion
      in three consecutive years or more.
        (5) Notwithstanding paragraph four of this subdivision,  an  owner  of
      real  property  described  in  the  categories  below is not required to
      submit a claim of exclusion:
        (i) property that has an assessed valuation of forty thousand  dollars
      or less;
        (ii) residential property containing ten or fewer dwelling units;
        (iii)  property  classified  in class one or two as defined in article
      eighteen of the real property tax law containing six or  fewer  dwelling
      units and one retail store; or
        (iv)  special  franchise property that is assessed pursuant to article
      six of the real property tax law.
        (6) The department shall inform owners of income  producing  property,
      other  than  owners  of the property described in paragraph five of this
      subdivision, of the requirement to file an income and expense statement,
      or, if applicable, a claim of exclusion, on the property  tax  bill  for
      payment  of the installment of real property tax that is due and payable
      on the first day of January and on the notice of  property  value.  Such
      notification shall also inform the owner of such property that a penalty
      and  interest  may  be  imposed on such owner for failure to submit such
      claim, and that any penalties or interest imposed on  such  owner  shall
      constitute a lien on such property.
        (7)  No  later  than  thirty days prior to the imposition of a penalty
      prescribed  in  paragraphs  one  and  four  of  this  subdivision,   the
      commissioner  shall  publish  on the website of the department a list of
      all  property  for  which  an  income  and  expense  statement,  or,  if
      applicable,  a  claim of exclusion, required to be filed pursuant to the
      provisions of this section was not timely filed. Such list shall contain
      the borough, block, lot,  address,  zip  code,  and  tax  class  of  the
      property. No later than the first day of February of each calendar year,
      the  commissioner  shall publish on the website of the department a list
      of all property for  which  an  income  and  expense  statement  or,  if
      applicable,  a  claim of exclusion, required to be filed pursuant to the
      provisions of this section was not timely filed. Such list shall contain
      the borough, block, lot,  address,  zip  code,  and  tax  class  of  the
      property,  the  penalty  amount imposed by the department for failure to
      comply  with  the  provisions  of  this  section,  and,  to  the  extent
      practicable,  the  number  of  consecutive  years the property owner has
      failed to file an income and expense statement,  or,  if  applicable,  a
      claim of exclusion.
        (8)  In  cases  where  the  closing  or finalizing of the sale of real
      property precedes the publication of the lists  described  in  paragraph
      seven  of  this  subdivision or the first property tax bill to reflect a
      penalty imposed on such property for the failure to file an  income  and
      expense  statement  or, if applicable, a claim of exclusion, required to
      be filed pursuant to this  section,  the  commissioner  may  waive  such
      penalty  and cancel any lien imposed as a result of such penalty, as may
      be described in guidelines prescribed by the commissioner, upon  request
      of the owner of such property.
    
        e. As used in this section, the term "income-producing property" means
      property  owned  for the purpose of securing an income from the property
      itself, but shall not include property with an assessed value  of  forty
      thousand  dollars  or  less,  or  residential property containing ten or
      fewer  dwelling  units  or  property  classified  in class one or two as
      defined in article eighteen of the real property tax law containing  six
      or fewer dwelling units and one retail store.
        f.  Except  in  accordance  with proper judicial order or as otherwise
      provided by law, it shall be unlawful for the commissioner, any  officer
      or  employee  of  the  department,  the  president  or a commissioner or
      employee of the tax commission, any person engaged or  retained  by  the
      department  or  the  tax commission on an independent contract basis, or
      any person, who, pursuant to this section, is permitted to  inspect  any
      income and expense statement or to whom a copy, an abstract or a portion
      of  any  such  statement  is  furnished, to divulge or make known in any
      manner except as provided in this  subdivision,  the  amount  of  income
      and/or  expense  or  any  particulars set forth or disclosed in any such
      statement required under this section. The commissioner,  the  president
      of the tax commission, or any commissioner or officer or employee of the
      department  or  the  tax  commission  charged  with  the custody of such
      statements shall not be required  to  produce  any  income  and  expense
      statement  or  evidence  of  anything contained in them in any action or
      proceeding in any court, except on behalf of the department or  the  tax
      commission.  Nothing  herein shall be construed to prohibit the delivery
      to an owner or his or her duly authorized representative of a  certified
      copy of any statement filed by such owner pursuant to this section or to
      prohibit  the  publication of statistics so classified as to prevent the
      identification of particular statements and the items thereof, or making
      known aggregate income and expense information disclosed with respect to
      property classified as class four as defined in article eighteen of  the
      real  property  tax law without identifying information about individual
      leases, or making known a range as determined by the commissioner within
      which the income and expenses of a  property  classified  as  class  two
      falls,  or the inspection by the legal representatives of the department
      or of the tax commission of the statement of any owner who  shall  bring
      an  action to correct the assessment. Any violation of the provisions of
      this subdivision shall be punished by a fine not exceeding one  thousand
      dollars  or  by  imprisonment  not  exceeding  one year, or both, at the
      discretion of the court, and if the offender be an officer  or  employee
      of the department or the tax commission, the offender shall be dismissed
      from office.
        g.  The  commissioner  shall  be  authorized  to  promulgate rules and
      regulations necessary to effectuate the purposes of this section.
        h. Subdivision f of this section shall be deemed a state  statute  for
      purposes  of paragraph (a) of subdivision two of section eighty-seven of

      date of payment at the rate of ten per centum per annum from the date on
      which such tax or such part thereof became due and payable to May first,
      nineteen  hundred  thirty-seven,  or at the rate of seven per centum per
      annum for such  period  if  the  comptroller  and  the  commissioner  of
      finance, in their discretion, both determine that the payment of any tax
      arrears  at  such  reduced  rate  of  interest  may  operate to save the
      property upon which such  taxes  are  in  arrears  from  foreclosure  or
      encourage its development or is otherwise in the public interest, at the
      rate  of  seven  per  centum  per annum from May first, nineteen hundred
      thirty-seven to August first, nineteen hundred sixty-nine,  from  August
      first,  nineteen  hundred  sixty-nine to December thirty-first, nineteen
      hundred seventy-six, at the rate of seven per centum per  annum  if  the
      annual  tax on a parcel is two thousand dollars or less, and at the rate
      of one per centum per month if the annual tax on a parcel is  more  than
      two  thousand  dollars  or,  irrespective of the annual tax, if a parcel
      consists of vacant or unimproved land, and from January first,  nineteen
      hundred  seventy-seven, at the rate of seven per centum per annum if the
      annual tax on a parcel is two thousand dollars or less, and at the  rate
      of  fifteen  per  centum per annum if the annual tax on a parcel is more
      than two thousand dollars or, irrespective  of  the  annual  tax,  if  a
      parcel consists of vacant or unimproved land.
        c.  If  any tax on real estate which shall have become due and payable
      on or after April first, nineteen  hundred  thirty-seven  and  prior  to
      August first, nineteen hundred sixty-nine is unpaid in whole or in part,
      the  commissioner  of finance shall charge, receive and collect interest
    
      upon the amount of such tax or such part thereof, to  be  calculated  to
      the  date  of payment at the rate of seven per centum per annum from the
      day on which such tax or such part thereof became  due  and  payable  to
      August  first,  nineteen hundred sixty-nine, from August first, nineteen
      hundred  sixty-nine   to   December   thirty-first,   nineteen   hundred
      seventy-six, at the rate of seven per centum per annum if the annual tax
      on  a parcel is two thousand dollars or less, and at the rate of one per
      centum per month if the annual tax on a parcel is more than two thousand
      dollars or, irrespective of the annual tax,  if  a  parcel  consists  of
      vacant  or  unimproved  land,  and  from January first, nineteen hundred
      seventy-seven at the rate of seven per centum per annum  if  the  annual
      tax  on  a  parcel  is  two thousand dollars or less, and at the rate of
      fifteen per centum per annum if the annual tax on a parcel is more  than
      two  thousand  dollars  or,  irrespective of the annual tax, if a parcel
      consists of vacant or unimproved land.
        d. If any tax on real estate which shall have become due  and  payable
      on  or  after  August  first,  nineteen  hundred sixty-nine and prior to
      December thirty-first, nineteen hundred seventy-six, is unpaid in  whole
      or  in  part,  the  commissioner  of  finance  shall charge, receive and
      collect interest upon the amount of such tax or such part thereof, to be
      calculated from the date on which such tax or such part  thereof  became
      due  and payable to December thirty-first, nineteen hundred seventy-six,
      at the rate of seven per centum per annum if the annual tax on a  parcel
      is  two  thousand dollars or less, and at the rate of one per centum per
      month if the annual tax on a parcel is more than  two  thousand  dollars
      or,  irrespective  of  the annual tax, if a parcel consists of vacant or
      unimproved land, and from January first, nineteen hundred  seventy-seven
      at  the rate of seven per centum per annum if the annual tax on a parcel
      is two thousand dollars or less, and at the rate of fifteen  per  centum
      per  annum  if  the  annual  tax  on  a parcel is more than two thousand
      dollars or, irrespective of the annual tax,  if  a  parcel  consists  of
      vacant or unimproved land.
        e. If any tax on real estate which shall become due and payable at any
      time  on  or  after January first, nineteen hundred seventy-seven, shall
      remain unpaid in whole or in part on the  fifteenth  day  following  the
      date on which the same shall become due and payable, the commissioner of
      finance  shall  charge,  receive and collect interest upon the amount of
      such tax or such part thereof remaining  unpaid  on  that  date,  to  be
      calculated  from  the  day on which such tax or such part thereof became
      due and payable to the date of payment at the rate of seven  per  centum
      per annum if the annual tax on a parcel is two thousand dollars or less,
      and  at  the rate of fifteen per centum per annum if the annual tax on a
      parcel is more than two thousand dollars or, irrespective of the  annual
      tax, if a parcel consists of vacant or unimproved land.
        f. If any tax on real estate which shall become due and payable at any
      time on or after July first, nineteen hundred seventy-nine, shall remain
      unpaid  in  whole  or in part on the fifteenth day following the date on
      which the same shall become due and payable,  or  if  any  tax  on  real
      estate  which  became  due  and  payable  prior  to July first, nineteen
      hundred seventy-nine shall remain unpaid on that date, the  commissioner
      of finance shall charge, receive and collect interest upon the amount of
      such tax or such part thereof remaining unpaid, to be calculated, in the
      case  of  any  tax  which  shall become due and payable on or after July
      first, nineteen hundred seventy-nine, from the day on which such tax  or
      such  part  thereof  became  due and payable, and in the case of any tax
      which became due and payable  prior  to  July  first,  nineteen  hundred
      seventy-nine,  from  July  first,  nineteen hundred seventy-nine, to the
      date of payment at the rate of seven per centum per annum if the  annual
    
      tax on a parcel is two thousand seven hundred fifty dollars or less, and
      at  the  rate  of  fifteen  per  centum per annum if the annual tax on a
      parcel is more  than  two  thousand  seven  hundred  fifty  dollars  or,
      irrespective  of  the  annual  tax,  if  a  parcel consists of vacant or
      unimproved land. Any interest accrued  prior  to  July  first,  nineteen
      hundred  seventy-nine,  pursuant  to  the preceding subdivisions of this
      section shall be unaffected by the provisions of this subdivision.
        g. No later than the twenty-fifth day of May of each year, the banking
      commission shall transmit a written recommendation to the council  of  a
      proposed  interest  rate  to  be charged for nonpayment of taxes on real
      estate in those cases where the annual tax on a parcel is more than  two
      thousand  seven  hundred  fifty  dollars  or  where, irrespective of the
      annual tax, a parcel consists of vacant or unimproved  land.  In  making
      such  recommendations  the  commission  shall  consider  the  prevailing
      interest rates charged for commercial loans extended to prime  borrowers
      by commercial banks operating in the city and shall propose a rate of at
      least  six per centum per annum greater than such rates. The council may
      by  resolution  adopt  an  interest  rate  to  be  applicable   to   the
      aforementioned  parcels  and  may specify in such resolution the date on
      which such interest rate is to take effect. This subdivision  shall  not
      apply  to any fiscal year beginning on or after July first, two thousand
      five.
        h.  Notwithstanding  anything  to  the  contrary  contained   in   the
      recommendation transmitted by the banking commission to the city council
      relative  to  the  proposed  rate  of  interest to be charged during the
      fiscal  year  of  the  city  commencing  July  first,  nineteen  hundred
      seventy-nine  in  the  case  of  nonpayment  of  real  estate  taxes, or
      contained in the resolution adopted by the council  in  accordance  with
      such  recommendation,  the  council  hereby sets the interest rate to be
      charged during the fiscal  year  of  the  city  commencing  July  first,
      nineteen  hundred  seventy-nine  for  nonpayment of real estate taxes at
      eighteen per centum per annum where the annual tax on a parcel  is  more
      than  two  thousand  seven  hundred  fifty  dollars  or where the parcel
      consists of vacant or unimproved land.
        i. The interest  mentioned  in  the  foregoing  subdivisions  of  this
      section  shall  be paid over and accounted for from time to time by such
      commissioner of finance as a part of the tax collected by him or her.
        j. When an installment agreement has been entered into pursuant to any
      of the provisions of chapter four  of  this  title,  during  the  period
      beginning  on  the  date  this subdivision takes effect and ending April
      thirtieth, nineteen hundred  eighty-two,  the  commissioner  of  finance
      shall,  notwithstanding  any higher rate of interest prescribed pursuant
      to applicable law, and unless a lower rate of interest is applicable  to
      a  parcel  covered  by  such  an  agreement, charge, collect and receive
      interest on the arrears due and payable  under  such  agreement,  to  be
      calculated at the rate of ten percent per annum from May first, nineteen
      hundred  eighty-two  to  the  date  of  payment of each installment. Any
      interest accrued or  accruing  prior  to  May  first,  nineteen  hundred
      eighty-two  shall  not be affected by the provisions of this subdivision
      but shall be charged, collected and received in the manner  and  at  the
      rates  prescribed  pursuant  to applicable law. Such ten percent rate of
      interest shall be applicable only if, as of May first, nineteen  hundred
      eighty-two,  (i)  there  has been no default in such agreement, and (ii)
      all current taxes, assessments or other legal charges are paid  as  they
      become  due  or  within  the  period  of grace provided by law. Where an
      installment agreement has been entered into prior to May fifth, nineteen
      hundred eighty-two pursuant to the provisions of either paragraph  three
      of  subdivision  a of section 11-413 prior to March fourteenth, nineteen
    
      hundred  seventy-nine  or  of  subdivision  a  of  section   11-405   or
      subdivision  h  of section 11-409 of chapter four of this title and said
      agreement is current as to both installment payments and current  taxes,
      assessments  and  other  legal  charges, the commissioner of finance, on
      application of the party who entered into  such  agreement,  may  cancel
      said  agreement  and  enter  into  a  new agreement containing the terms
      provided on May fifth, nineteen hundred eighty-two. If  any  such  prior
      agreement  is not cancelled as herein provided, any installments due and
      payable under such agreement on or after  May  first,  nineteen  hundred
      eighty-two  shall  be  subject  to  interest  at  the rate and under the
      conditions set forth above. In the event of any  subsequent  default  or
      failure  to  make  timely  payment of any installment payment or current
      tax, assessment or other legal charge, the ten percent rate of  interest
      specified in this subdivision shall thereupon cease to be applicable and
      the commissioner of finance shall thereafter charge, collect and receive
      interest  in  the  manner  and  at  the  rates  prescribed  pursuant  to
      applicable law.
        k. 1. Notwithstanding any other  provision  of  this  section  to  the
      contrary,  but  subject  to  the exception contained in paragraph two of
      this subdivision, in the case of an installment of tax on real  property
      described  in paragraph b of subdivision four of section fifteen hundred
      nineteen of the city charter, interest shall be  charged,  received  and
      collected  at  the  rate  established  pursuant  to this section if such
      installment shall remain unpaid in whole or in part on the date on which
      it shall become due and payable. This paragraph shall not apply  to  any
      installment  of tax that becomes due and payable on or after July first,
      two thousand five.
        2. If the tax rate for any fiscal year of the city has not been set by
      the fifteenth day of June preceding  the  start  of  such  fiscal  year,
      interest  shall  not  be charged, received and collected with respect to
      the first installment of tax which is due and payable on the  first  day
      of July in such fiscal year if such installment is paid on or before the
      extended  payment  date.  For  this  purpose, the term "extended payment
      date" means the date which falls the same number of days after the first
      day of July in such fiscal year as the number of days the date such  tax
      rate is set falls after such fifteenth day of June. This paragraph shall
      not  apply  to any installment of tax that becomes due and payable on or
      after July first, two thousand five.
        l. No later than the fifth day following the date of enactment of this
      subdivision in the year nineteen hundred ninety and no  later  than  May
      twenty-fifth  of  each  succeeding  year,  the  banking commission shall
      transmit a written recommendation to the council  of  proposed  interest
      rates  to  be  charged for nonpayment of taxes on real property in those
      cases in which the annual tax on a parcel, other  than  a  parcel  which
      consists  of  vacant  or  unimproved land, is not more than two thousand
      seven hundred fifty dollars. In making such recommendations, the banking
      commission shall consider the  prevailing  interest  rates  charged  for
      commercial  loans  extended  to  prime  borrowers  by  commercial  banks
      operating in the city. In the case of any such parcel  with  respect  to
      which  the  real  property  taxes  are  held  in  escrow and paid to the
      commissioner of finance by a "mortgage escrow agent," as  that  term  is
      defined  in  section  fifteen  hundred nineteen of the city charter, the
      proposed rate shall be at least six percent per annum greater than  such
      prevailing  prime  rate,  and in the case of all other such parcels, the
      proposed rate shall be at least equal to such prevailing prime rate. The
      council may by resolution adopt interest rates to be applicable  to  the
      aforementioned  parcels  and may specify in such resolution the dates on
      which such interest rates are to take effect. In the event  the  council
    
      does  not  adopt  interest  rates  as  provided in this subdivision, the
      interest rates otherwise specified in this section shall be  applicable.
      This  subdivision  shall  not  apply  to any fiscal year beginning on or
      after July first, two thousand five.

Section 11-224.1 ::    
        
     
        § 11-224.1 Interest on unpaid real property tax.
        (a)  For  real  property  with  an assessed value of two hundred fifty
      thousand dollars or less, if an installment of tax due  and  payable  is
      not  paid  by  July  fifteenth,  October fifteenth, January fifteenth or
      April fifteenth, interest shall be imposed on such unpaid amounts.
        (b) For real property with an assessed value of over two hundred fifty
      thousand dollars, if an installment of tax due and payable is  not  paid
      by July first or January first, interest shall be imposed on such unpaid
      amounts.
        (c)  Interest rates on tax due and payable on or after July first, two
      thousand five.
        If the council does not adopt interest rates, the rates shall  be  (a)
      for  real  property with an assessed value of two hundred fifty thousand
      dollars or less, seven percent per annum; and (b) for real property with
      an assessed value of over two hundred fifty  thousand  dollars,  fifteen
      percent per annum.
        (d)  (i)  Any  tax or part of a tax that became due before July first,
      two thousand five and remains unpaid after June thirtieth, two  thousand
      five,  shall  continue  to  accrue  interest  until  paid  at  the  rate
      applicable under this section.
        (ii) This section shall not apply  to  interest  accrued  before  July
      first, two thousand five.
        (e)  Council  adopted  rates.  By  May  twenty-fifth of each year, the
      banking commission shall send a written recommendation to the council of
      a proposed interest rate to be charged for nonpayment of taxes  on  real
      property.  The  commission  shall consider the prevailing interest rates
      charged for commercial loans extended to prime borrowers  by  commercial
      banks operating in the city and:
        (i)  for  real  property  with  an assessed value of two hundred fifty
      thousand dollars or less, shall propose a rate at least  equal  to  such
      prevailing prime rate;
        (ii)  for  real  property  with  an assessed value of over two hundred
      fifty thousand dollars, shall propose a rate of at least six percent per
      annum greater than such prevailing prime rate.
        The council may by resolution adopt interest rates to be applicable to
      the aforementioned properties and may specify  in  such  resolution  the
      date that such rates will take effect.
        (f)  If the tax rate for any fiscal year of the city is not set by the
      fifteenth of June preceding the start  of  such  fiscal  year,  interest
      shall  not  be  charged for the first installment of tax which is due on
      the first day of July in such fiscal year if such installment is paid on
      or before  the  extended  payment  date.  For  this  purpose,  the  term
      "extended  payment  date"  means the date which falls the same number of
      days after the first day of July in such fiscal year as  the  number  of
      days  the  date  such  tax rate is set falls after such fifteenth day of
      June.
        (g) For purposes of this section, property  held  in  the  cooperative
      form  of ownership shall not be deemed to have an assessed value of over
      two hundred fifty thousand dollars  if  the  property's  assessed  value
      divided by the number of residential dwelling units is two hundred fifty
      thousand dollars or less per unit.

Section 11-225 ::    
        
     
        §  11-225  Power  of  tax commission to remit or reduce taxes. The tax
      commission shall have power to remit or reduce a tax imposed  upon  real
      property where lawful cause therefor is shown or where such tax is found
      to  be excessive or otherwise erroneous, but such remission or reduction
      shall  be  made  only  with  respect  to  an  assessment  for  which  an
      application for correction has been made pursuant to section one hundred
      sixty-three  of the charter, and no such remission or reduction shall be
      made when a claim to correct the assessment or recover the tax would  be
      barred  by  passage  of  time or other adequate defense, or when, at the
      time that the determination is rendered, applications for correction  or
      other  proceedings are pending to review the assessment of such property
      for more than one subsequent fiscal year. Notwithstanding the  foregoing
      provisions  of  this  section, the tax commission shall have no power to
      remit or reduce a tax pursuant to this  section  more  than  five  years
      after  the  last  day  on which an application for correction could have
      been filed to appeal the unlawful or  erroneous  assessment  upon  which
      such tax was based. If such tax shall have been paid the commissioner of
      finance  is  authorized  to  refund  or  credit  the  amount of any such
      remission or reduction  granted  pursuant  to  this  section.  When  the
      correction  results from an application for correction made by the board
      of managers of a condominium, a refund may  be  paid  to  the  board  of
      managers for distribution to the individual unit owners with the consent
      of  such  board  and  on  such  conditions  as  the  commissioner  deems
      appropriate.

        §  11-238  Real  property  tax  surcharge  on  absentee  landlords. a.
      Imposition of surcharge. A real property tax surcharge is hereby imposed
      on class one property, as defined in section eighteen hundred two of the
      real property tax law,  excluding  vacant  land,  that  provides  rental
      income  and  is not the primary residence of the owner or owners of such
      class one property, or the primary residence of the parent or  child  of
      such owner or owners, in an amount equal to zero percent of the net real
      property  taxes  for  fiscal years beginning on or after July first, two
      thousand six. As used in this section, "net real property tax" means the
      real property tax assessed on class one property after deduction for any
      exemption or abatement received pursuant to the real property tax law or
      this title.
        b. Rental income, primary residence and/or relationship  to  owner  or
      owners.  The property shall be deemed to be the primary residence of the
      owner or owners thereof, if such property would be eligible  to  receive
      the  real  property  tax  exemption  pursuant  to  section  four hundred
      twenty-five of the real property tax law,  regardless  of  whether  such
      owner  or  owners  has  filed  an  application  for,  or the property is
      currently receiving, such exemption. Proof of primary residence and  the
      resident's  or  residents'  relationship  to the owner or owners and the
      absence of rental income shall be in the  form  of  a  certification  as
      required by the rules of the commissioner.
        c.  Rules.  The  department  of finance shall have, in addition to any
      other functions, powers and duties which have been or may  be  conferred
      on  it  by  law, the power to make and promulgate rules to carry out the
      purposes of this section, including, but not limited to,  rules  related
      to  the  timing,  form  and  manner  of any certification required to be
      submitted under this section.
        d. Penalties. 1. Notwithstanding any provision of any general, special
      or local law to the contrary, an owner or  owners  shall  be  personally
      liable  for  any taxes owed pursuant to this section whenever such owner
      or owners fail to comply with this  section  or  the  rules  promulgated
      hereunder,  or makes a false or misleading statement or omission and the
      commissioner determines that such act was due to the  owner  or  owners'
      willful neglect, or that under such circumstances such act constituted a
      fraud  on  the  department.  The remedy provided herein for an action in
      personam shall be in addition to any other remedy or procedure  for  the
      enforcement  of  collection  of  delinquent  taxes  provided by general,
      special or local law.
        2. If the commissioner should determine, within three years  from  the
      filing of an application or certification pursuant to this section, that
      there  was a material misstatement on such application or certification,
      he or she shall impose a  penalty  tax  against  the  property  of  five
      hundred dollars, in accordance with the rules promulgated hereunder.
        e. Cessation of use. In the event that a property granted an exemption
      from  taxation pursuant to this section ceases to be used as the primary
      residence of such owner or owners or his, her or their parent or  child,
      or  produces  rental  income,  such  owner or owners shall so notify the
      commissioner.

Section 11-239. ::    
        
     
        §  11-239.  Real property tax rebate for certain residential property.
      1.  For fiscal years beginning the first of July, two thousand three and
      ending the thirtieth of June, two thousand nine, a rebate in the  amount
      of  the  lesser  of  four  hundred  dollars  or the annual tax liability
      imposed on the property shall be paid to an owner or  tenant-stockholder
      who,  as of the date the application provided for in subdivision four of
      this section is due, owns a one, two or  three  family  residence  or  a
      dwelling  unit  in  residential  property  held  in  the  condominium or
      cooperative form of ownership that is the owner or  tenant-stockholder's
      primary  residence  and meets all other eligibility requirements of this
      section. If, with respect to the fiscal year beginning on the  first  of
      July,  two  thousand  eight  and  ending  on  the thirtieth of June, two
      thousand nine, an increase in average  real  property  tax  rates  would
      otherwise be necessary in the resolution of the city council fixing real
      property  tax  rates  for such fiscal year pursuant to the charter, then
      the rebate to  be  paid  for  such  fiscal  year  shall  be  reduced  or
      eliminated  as  follows:  where the sum to be raised by such increase is
      less than seven hundred fifty million dollars, then such rebate shall be
      reduced by fifty cents for each dollar of increase, and where the sum to
      be raised by such increase is seven hundred  fifty  million  dollars  or
      more,  then such rebate shall be eliminated. Notwithstanding anything to
      the  contrary  in  sections  four  hundred  twenty-one-a,  four  hundred
      twenty-one-b  or four hundred twenty-one-g of the real property tax law,
      an owner or tenant-stockholder  whose  property  is  receiving  benefits
      pursuant  to  such  sections  shall  not  be prohibited from receiving a
      rebate pursuant to this section if such owner or  tenant-stockholder  is
      otherwise  eligible  to  receive  such  rebate.  Tenant-stockholders  of
      dwelling units in a cooperative apartment corporation incorporated as  a
      mutual  company  pursuant  to  article  two, four, five or eleven of the
      private housing  finance  law  shall  not  be  entitled  to  the  rebate
      authorized   by   this  section.  Such  rebate  shall  be  paid  by  the
      commissioner of finance to eligible  owners  or  tenant-stockholders  in
      accordance with rules promulgated by the commissioner of finance.
        2.  Eligibility requirements. a. To qualify for the rebate pursuant to
      this section (1) the property  must  be  a  one,  two  or  three  family
      residence or residential property held in the condominium or cooperative
      form of ownership;
        (2) the property must serve as the primary residence of one or more of
      the owners or tenant-stockholders thereof; and
        (3)  the  owner must not be in arrears in the payment of real property
      taxes in an amount in excess of twenty-five dollars for the fiscal  year
      for  which  the  rebate  is  claimed and all prior fiscal years, and for
      residential property held in the cooperative form  of  ownership,  there
      must be no arrears in the payment of real property taxes in an amount in
      excess  of  an  average of twenty-five dollars per dwelling unit in such
      cooperative apartment corporation for the  fiscal  year  for  which  the
      rebate is claimed and all prior fiscal years.
        b. If legal title to the property is held by one or more trustees, the
      beneficial  owner  or  owners  shall  be  deemed to own the property for
      purposes of this subdivision.
        3. Definitions. As used in this section:
        a. "Applicant" means the owner  or  owners  or  tenant-stockholder  or
      tenant-stockholders of the property.
        b. "Property" means a one, two or three family residence or a dwelling
      unit in residential property held in the condominium or cooperative form
      of ownership.
        4.  Application  procedure.  a. Generally. An application for a rebate
      pursuant to this section for the fiscal  year  beginning  the  first  of
    
      July, two thousand three, shall be made no later than the date published
      by  the  commissioner  of  finance  in  the  city  record  and  in other
      appropriate general notices pursuant to  this  subdivision,  which  date
      shall  be  no  earlier  than  thirty days after enactment of a state law
      authorizing such rebate. An application for a rebate  pursuant  to  this
      section  for  fiscal  years beginning on or after the first of July, two
      thousand four and ending on the thirtieth of  June,  two  thousand  six,
      shall  be  made  no later than the fifteenth of March of the fiscal year
      for which the rebate is claimed. An application for a rebate pursuant to
      this section for fiscal years beginning on or after the first  of  July,
      two  thousand  six,  shall  be made no later than the first of September
      following the fiscal year for which the rebate is claimed. All owners or
      tenant-stockholders  of  property  who  primarily  reside  thereon  must
      jointly  file an application for the rebate on or before the application
      deadline, unless such owners or tenant-stockholders currently receive  a
      real   property   tax   exemption   pursuant  to  section  four  hundred
      twenty-five, four hundred fifty-eight, four hundred fifty-eight-a,  four
      hundred  fifty  nine-c  or four hundred sixty-seven of the real property
      tax law, in which case no separate application for a rebate pursuant  to
      this section shall be required. Such application may be filed by mail if
      it  is  enclosed  in  a  postpaid  envelope  properly  addressed  to the
      commissioner  of  finance,  deposited  in  a  post  office  or  official
      depository under the exclusive care of the United States postal service,
      and  postmarked  by  the  United  States postal service on or before the
      application deadline. Each such application shall  be  made  on  a  form
      prescribed  by  the  commissioner  of  finance,  which shall require the
      applicant to agree to notify the commissioner of finance if his, her  or
      their  primary  residence changes after receiving the rebate pursuant to
      this section, or after filing an application for such  rebate,  if  his,
      her  or  their  primary residence changes after filing such application,
      but before receiving  such  rebate.  The  commissioner  of  finance  may
      request   that   proof  of  primary  residence  be  submitted  with  the
      application. No rebate pursuant to this section shall be granted  unless
      the  applicant,  if  required  to  do  so  by this subdivision, files an
      application within the time periods prescribed in this subdivision.
        b. Approval or denial of application. If the commissioner  of  finance
      determines that the applicant is entitled to the rebate pursuant to this
      section,  the  commissioner of finance shall approve the application and
      such owner or tenant-stockholder shall thereafter  be  entitled  to  the
      rebate  as  provided  in  this  section.  If the commissioner of finance
      determines that the applicant is not entitled to the rebate pursuant  to
      this  section,  the commissioner of finance shall mail to each applicant
      not entitled to the rebate a notice of denial of  that  application  for
      the  rebate  for  that  year  in  accordance  with  rules  for denial of
      applications to be promulgated  by  the  commissioner  of  finance.  The
      notice  of  denial shall specify the reason for such denial and shall be
      sent on a form prescribed by the commissioner  of  finance.  Failure  to
      mail  any  such  notice  of  denial  or  the failure of any applicant to
      receive  such  notice  shall  not  prevent  the  levy,  collection   and
      enforcement of taxes on such applicant's property.
        c.   Proof  of  residency.  (1)  Requests.  From  time  to  time,  the
      commissioner of finance may request proof of residency from the owner or
      tenant-stockholder receiving a rebate pursuant to this section.
        (2) Timing. A request for proof of residency shall be mailed at  least
      sixty  days  prior  to  the  ensuing  application deadline. The owner or
      tenant-stockholder shall submit proof of his, her or their residency  in
      an  application  to  the  commissioner  of  finance  on  or  before  the
      application deadline.
    
        d. Review of submission. The burden  shall  be  on  the  applicant  to
      establish  that  the property is his, her or their primary residence and
      that any other requirements to obtain the rebate are satisfied.  If  the
      applicant  submits  proof  of  residency  on  or  before the application
      deadline,  and  the  submission  demonstrates  to  the  commissioner  of
      finance's satisfaction that the property is the primary residence of the
      applicant, and  if  the  requirements  of  this  section  are  otherwise
      satisfied,  the  rebate  shall  be  paid. Otherwise, the commissioner of
      finance shall discontinue  the  rebate  and,  where  appropriate,  shall
      proceed as further provided herein.
        e.  Oath.  The  commissioner  of  finance  shall have the authority to
      require that statements made in connection with  any  application  filed
      pursuant  to  this  section  be  made under oath. Such application shall
      contain the following  declaration:  "I  certify  that  all  information
      contained  in  this  application  is  true and correct to the best of my
      knowledge and belief.  I understand that willful  making  of  any  false
      statement  of  material fact herein will subject me to the provisions of
      law relevant to the making and filing  of  false  instruments  and  will
      render  this  application  null  and  void." Such application shall also
      state that the applicant agrees to comply with and  be  subject  to  the
      rules  promulgated  from  time  to  time  by the commissioner of finance
      pursuant to this section.
        5. Discontinuance of rebate. a. Generally. The commissioner of finance
      shall discontinue any rebate paid or granted pursuant to this section if
      it appears that: (1) the property may not be the  primary  residence  of
      the  owner or tenant-stockholder who received or applied for the rebate,
      (2) title to the property  has  been  transferred  to  a  new  owner  or
      tenant-stockholder,  or (3) the property is otherwise no longer eligible
      for the rebate. For the purposes of this section, title to that  portion
      of real property owned by a cooperative apartment corporation in which a
      tenant-stockholder of such corporation resides, and which is represented
      by his or her share or shares of stock in such corporation as determined
      by its or their proportional relationship to the total outstanding stock
      of  the  corporation,  including that owned by the corporation, shall be
      deemed to be vested in such tenant-stockholder.
        b. Rights of owners and tenant-stockholders. Upon determining  that  a
      rebate  paid or granted pursuant to this section should be discontinued,
      the commissioner of finance shall  mail  a  notice  so  stating  to  the
      affected owner or tenant-stockholder at the time and in the manner to be
      provided in rules promulgated by the commissioner of finance. Such owner
      or  tenant-stockholder  shall  be  entitled  to  seek administrative and
      judicial review of such action in the manner provided by law,  provided,
      that the burden shall be on the owner or tenant-stockholder to establish
      eligibility for the rebate.
        6. Recovery of prior rebate. If the commissioner of finance determines
      that  the  owner  or tenant-stockholder was (a) not entitled to a rebate
      under this section, or (b) that a rebate was paid or calculated in error
      under this section, then the commissioner of finance  shall  recover  or
      recalculate  such rebate and the amount of the rebate or an amount equal
      to the difference between the rebate originally paid and the  amount  to
      which  the  owner  or  tenant-stockholder was entitled shall be deducted
      from any refund otherwise  payable,  and  any  balance  of  such  amount
      remaining  unpaid  shall  be  paid to the commissioner of finance within
      thirty days from the date of mailing by the commissioner of finance of a
      notice of the amount payable. Such amount payable shall constitute a tax
      lien on the property as of the date of such  notice  and,  if  not  paid
      within  such  thirty-day  period,  penalty  and  interest  at  the  rate
      applicable to delinquent taxes on such property  shall  be  charged  and
    
      collected  on  such  amount  from  the date of such notice to the day of
      payment, and such amount payable shall be enforceable as a tax  lien  in
      accordance  with  provisions  of  law relating to the enforcement of tax
      liens in any such city.
        7.   Penalty   for   material  misstatements.  a.  Generally.  If  the
      commissioner of finance determines, within three years from the  payment
      of  a  rebate  pursuant  to  this  section,  that  there  was a material
      misstatement in an application filed pursuant to this section or  in  an
      application  filed  pursuant  to section four hundred twenty-five of the
      real property tax law and that such misstatement provided the basis  for
      the  payment of a rebate under this section, the commissioner of finance
      shall proceed to impose a  penalty  tax  against  the  property  of  one
      thousand  dollars  in  addition  to  recovering  the amount of any prior
      rebate under subdivision six of this section. An  application  shall  be
      deemed to contain a material misstatement for this purpose when either:
        (1)  the  applicant claimed the property was his, her or their primary
      residence, when it was not;
        (2) the applicant claimed the  property  was  eligible  for  a  rebate
      pursuant to this section, when it was not; or
        (3)  the applicant claimed that the applicant owned the property, when
      the applicant did not.
        b. Procedure. When the  commissioner  of  finance  determines  that  a
      penalty  tax  should be imposed, the penalty tax shall be entered on the
      next  ensuing  tentative  or  final  assessment  roll.  Each  owner   or
      tenant-stockholder shall be given notice of the possible imposition of a
      penalty  tax,  and shall be entitled to seek administrative and judicial
      review of such action in the manner provided by law.
        c. Additional consequences. A penalty tax may be imposed  pursuant  to
      this  subdivision whether or not the improper rebate has been revoked in
      the manner provided for by this section.
        8. Rulemaking. The commissioner of  finance  shall  be  authorized  to
      promulgate rules necessary to effectuate the purposes of this section.
        9.  Non-disclosure.  The  information  contained  in  applications  or
      statements in  connection  therewith  filed  with  the  commissioner  of
      finance  pursuant  to  subdivision  four  of  this  section shall not be
      subject to disclosure under article six of the public officers law.

      due and payable date provided on such notice, and, if not paid  by  such
      due and payable date, interest at the rate applicable to delinquent real
    
      property  taxes  on such property shall be charged and collected on such
      amount from the due and payable date provided on such notice to the date
      of payment, and such amount payable shall be enforceable as a  tax  lien
      in  accordance with provisions of law relating to the enforcement of tax
      liens in any such city.
        8. Rebate not deemed a refund. Any rebate authorized by  this  section
      to  be  paid  by the commissioner of finance shall not be deemed to be a
      refund of a real property tax payment.
        9. Overpayment. If, in any  proceeding  brought  pursuant  to  article
      seven  of  the real property tax law, the assessed valuation of eligible
      real property is reduced for the fiscal year beginning on the  first  of
      July,  two  thousand  twelve,  and such reduction results in a return of
      overpayment of real property taxes paid  with  respect  to  such  fiscal
      year,  the  amount of such overpayment shall be reduced by the amount of
      any rebate paid  pursuant  to  this  section.  If  such  overpayment  is
      returned before a rebate is paid pursuant to this section, the amount of
      any  rebate paid pursuant to this section shall be reduced by the amount
      of such overpayment.
