Section 11-1610
---------------

Section 11-1610 ::    
        
     
        §  11-1610  Determination of tax. If a return required by this chapter
      is not filed, or if a return when filed is  incorrect  or  insufficient,
      the amount of tax due shall be determined by the commissioner of finance
      from  such  information  as may be obtainable and, if necessary, the tax
      may be estimated on the basis of external indices,  such  as  volume  of
      sales,  inventories,  purchases  of  containers,  or  of  raw materials,
      production figures, and/or other factors. Notice of  such  determination
      shall be given to the person liable for the collection and/or payment of
      the  tax.  Such  determination shall finally and irrevocably fix the tax
      unless the person against whom it is assessed, within thirty days  after
      giving  notice of such determination, shall apply to the commissioner of
      finance for a hearing, or unless the commissioner of finance of  his  or
      her  own  motion  shall  redetermine  the  same.  After such hearing the
      commissioner of finance shall give notice of his or her determination to
      the person against whom the tax is assessed. The  determination  of  the
      commissioner  of  finance  shall  be reviewable for error, illegality or
      unconstitutionality or any other reason whatsoever by a proceeding under
      article seventy-eight of the civil practice law and rules if application
      therefor is made to the supreme  court  within  four  months  after  the
      giving  of  the notice of such determination. A proceeding under article
      seventy-eight  of  the  civil  practice  law  and  rules  shall  not  be
      instituted unless: (a) the amount of any tax sought to be reviewed, with
      penalties  and  interest  thereon, if any, shall be first deposited with
      the  commissioner  of  finance  and  there  shall  be  filed  with   the
      commissioner  of  finance  an  undertaking,  issued  by a surety company
      authorized to transact business  in  this  state  and  approved  by  the
      superintendent   of   insurance   of  this  state  as  to  solvency  and
      responsibility, in such amount as a justice of the supreme  court  shall
      approve  to  the  effect that if such proceeding be dismissed or the tax
      confirmed, the petitioner will pay  all  costs  and  charges  which  may
      accrue in the prosecution of the proceeding; or (b) at the option of the
      applicant such undertaking filed with the commissioner of finance may be
      in  a  sum sufficient to cover the taxes, penalties and interest thereon
      stated in such determination plus the costs and charges which may accrue
      against it in the prosecution of the  proceeding,  in  which  event  the
      applicant  shall  not  be  required to deposit such taxes, penalties and
      interest as a condition precedent to the application.
    
    
    
    
    
    
    

Section 11-1611
---------------

Section 11-1611 ::    
        
     
        §  11-1611  Refunds.  a.  In  the  manner provided in this section the
      commissioner of finance shall refund or credit,  without  interest,  any
      tax,  penalty  or  interest  erroneously,  illegally or unconstitionally
      collected or paid if application to the commissioner of finance for such
      refund shall be made within one year from the payment thereof.  Whenever
      a  refund is made by the commissioner of finance, the commissioner shall
      state his or her reasons therefor in writing. Such  application  may  be
      made  by  the seller or supplier or the retailer or other person who has
      actually paid the tax. The commissioner of finance may, in lieu  of  any
      refund  required  to be made, allow credit therefor on payments due from
      the applicant.
        b. An application for a refund or credit made as herein provided shall
      be deemed an application for revision of any tax,  penalty  or  interest
      complained  of.  If  the  commissioner  of finance, prior to any hearing
      held, initially denies the  application  for  refund,  the  commissioner
      shall give notice of such determination of denial to the applicant. Such
      determination  shall  be  final  and  irrevocable  unless the applicant,
      within thirty days after the giving of  notice  of  such  determination,
      shall  apply to the commissioner of finance for a hearing, or unless the
      commissioner of finance of his or her own motion shall  redetermine  the
      same.  After  such hearing the commissioner of finance shall give notice
      of his or her determination to the applicant, who shall be  entitled  to
      review   such   determination   by  a  proceeding  pursuant  to  article
      seventy-eight of  the  civil  practice  law  and  rules,  provided  such
      proceeding  is  instituted  within  four  months after the giving of the
      notice of such determination, and provided that a final determination of
      tax was not previously made. Such a proceeding shall not  be  instituted
      unless  an undertaking is filed with the commissioner of finance in such
      amount and with such sureties as a justice of the  supreme  court  shall
      approve  to  the  effect that if such proceeding be dismissed or the tax
      confirmed, the petitioner shall pay all  costs  and  charges  which  may
      accrue in the prosecution of such proceeding.
        c.  A  person  shall  not  be entitled to a revision, refund or credit
      under this section  of  a  tax,  interest  or  penalty  which  had  been
      determined  to  be  due pursuant to the provisions of section 11-1610 of
      this chapter where such person has had a hearing or an opportunity for a
      hearing, as provided in said section, or has failed to avail himself  or
      herself  of  the remedies therein provided. No refund or credit shall be
      made of a tax, interest or penalty paid after  a  determination  by  the
      commissioner of finance made pursuant to section 11-1609 of this chapter
      unless  it  be  found  that such determination was erroneous, illegal or
      unconstitutional or otherwise improper, by the commissioner  of  finance
      after  a hearing or of the commissioner's own motion, or in a proceeding
      under article  seventy-eight  of  the  civil  practice  law  and  rules,
      pursuant  to  the  provisions  of said section, in which event refund or
      credit without interest shall be made of the tax,  interest  or  penalty
      found to have been overpaid.
    
    
    
    
    
    
    

Section 11-1612
---------------

Section 11-1612 ::    
        
     
        §  11-1612  Reserves.  In  cases  where  the seller or supplier or the
      retailer has applied for a fund and has instituted  a  proceeding  under
      article  seventy-eight  of  the civil practice law and rules to review a
      determination adverse to him or  her  on  his  or  her  application  for
      refund,  the  comptroller  shall set up appropriate reserves to meet any
      decision adverse to the city.
    
    
    
    
    
    
    

Section 11-1613
---------------

Section 11-1613 ::    
        
     
        §  11-1613  Remedies  exclusive.  The  remedies  provided  by sections
      11-1610 and 11-1611 of this chapter  shall  be  the  exclusive  remedies
      available  to any person for the review of tax liability imposed by this
      chapter; and no  determination  or  proposed  determination  of  tax  or
      determination  on  any  application  for  refund  shall  be  enjoined or
      reviewed by an action for declaratory judgment, an action for money  had
      and  received  or by any action or proceeding other than a proceeding in
      the nature of a certiorari proceeding under article seventy-eight of the
      civil practice law and rules; provided, however,  that  a  taxpayer  may
      proceed  by declaratory judgment if such taxpayer institutes suit within
      thirty days after a deficiency assessment is made and pays the amount of
      the deficiency assessment to the commissioner of finance  prior  to  the
      institution  of  such  suit  and  posts  a bond for costs as provided in
      section 11-1610 of this chapter.
    
    
    
    
    
    
    

Section 11-1614
---------------

Section 11-1614 ::    
        
     
        §  11-1614  Proceedings  to  recover  tax.  a.  Whenever any seller or
      supplier or retailer or other person shall fail to pay any tax,  penalty
      or interest imposed by this chapter as therein provided, the corporation
      counsel  shall, upon the request of the commissioner of finance bring or
      cause to be brought an action to enforce the  payment  of  the  same  on
      behalf  of the city of New York in any court of the state of New York or
      of  any  other  state  or  of  the  United  States.  If,  however,   the
      commissioner  of finance in his or her discretion believes that any such
      seller or supplier or  retailer  or  other  person  is  about  to  cease
      business, leave the state or remove or dissipate the assets out of which
      the  tax,  penalties  or  interest might be satisfied, and that any such
      tax, penalty or interest will not be paid when due, the commissioner  of
      finance  may declare such tax, penalty or interest to be immediately due
      and payable and may issue a warrant immediately.
        b. As an additional or alternate remedy, the commissioner  of  finance
      may  issue  a  warrant, directed to the city sheriff commanding the city
      sheriff to levy upon and sell the real  and  personal  property  of  the
      seller or supplier or retailer or other person liable for the tax, which
      may  be  found  within  the city, for the payment of the amount thereof,
      with any penalties and interest, and the cost of executing the  warrant,
      and  to return such warrant to the commissioner of finance and to pay to
      the commissioner of finance the money collected by virtue thereof within
      sixty days after the receipt of such warrant.  The  city  sheriff  shall
      within  five  days after the receipt of the warrant file with the county
      clerk a copy thereof, and  thereupon  such  clerk  shall  enter  in  the
      judgment  docket the name of the person mentioned in the warrant and the
      amount of the tax, penalties and  interest  for  which  the  warrant  is
      issued  and  the  date  when such copy is filed. Thereupon the amount of
      such warrant so docketed shall become a  lien  upon  the  title  to  and
      interest  in  real  and personal property of the person against whom the
      warrant is issued. The city sheriff shall then proceed upon the warrant,
      in the same manner, and with like effect, as that  provided  by  law  in
      respect  to executions issued against property upon judgments of a court
      of record, and for services in executing the warrant  the  city  sheriff
      shall  be  entitled to the same fees, which he or she may collect in the
      same manner. In the discretion of the commissioner of finance a  warrant
      of  like  terms,  force  and  effect  may  be issued and directed to any
      officer or employee of the department of finance, and in  the  execution
      thereof  such officer or employee shall have all the powers conferred by
      law upon sheriffs, but shall be entitled to no fee  or  compensation  in
      excess of the actual expenses paid in the performance of such duty. If a
      warrant  is  returned not satisfied in full, the commissioner of finance
      may from time to time issue new warrants and shall also  have  the  same
      remedies  to  enforce  the  amount  due  thereunder  as  if the city had
      recovered judgment therefor and  execution  thereon  had  been  returned
      unsatisfied.
        c.  Whenever  a  seller or supplier or the retailer shall make a sale,
      transfer, or assignment in bulk of any part of the whole of his  or  her
      fixtures,  or  of  his  or  her  stock  of  merchandise,  or of stock or
      merchandise and of fixtures pertaining to the conduct  or  operation  of
      business  of  the  seller or supplier or the retailer, otherwise than in
      the ordinary course of trade and regular prosecution  of  business,  the
      purchaser,  transferee or assignee shall at least ten days before taking
      possession of the subject of  said  sale,  transfer  or  assignment,  or
      paying  therefor,  notify the commissioner of finance by registered mail
      of the proposed sale and of the  price,  terms  and  conditions  thereof
      whether  or  not the seller, transferor or assignor, has represented to,
      or informed the purchaser, transferee or assignee that it owes  any  tax
    
      pursuant  to  this chapter, and whether or not the purchaser, transferee
      or assignee has knowledge that such taxes are  owing,  and  whether  any
      such taxes are in fact owing.
        Whenever  the  purchaser,  transferee  or  assignee shall fail to give
      notice to the commissioner of finance  as  required  by  the  proceeding
      paragraph,  or  whenever  the  commissioner  of finance shall inform the
      purchaser, transferee or assignee that a possible claim for such tax  or
      taxes  exists, any sums of money, property or choses in action, or other
      consideration, which the purchaser, transferee or assignee  is  required
      to  transfer over to the seller, transferor or assignor shall be subject
      to a first priority right and lien for any  such  taxes  theretofore  or
      thereafter  determined to be due from the seller, transferor or assignor
      to the city, and the purchaser, transferee or assignee is  forbidden  to
      transfer  to  the seller, transferor or assignor any such sums of money,
      property or choses in action to the extent of the amount of  the  city's
      claim.  For  failure  to comply with the provisions of this subdivision,
      the purchaser, transferee or assignee, in addition to being  subject  to
      the liabilities and remedies imposed under the provisions of article six
      of  the  uniform  commercial  code,  shall  be personally liable for the
      payment to  the  city  of  any  such  taxes  theretofore  or  thereafter
      determined  to  be  due  to  the  city  from  the  seller, transferor or
      assignor, and such liability may be assessed and enforced  in  the  same
      manner as the liability for tax under this chapter.
        d.  The commissioner of finance, if he or she finds that the interests
      of the city will not thereby be jeopardized, and upon such conditions as
      the commissioner of finance may require, may release any  property  from
      the  lien  of  any  warrant  or  vacate  such  warrant for unpaid taxes,
      additions to tax, penalties and interest filed pursuant to subdivision b
      of this section, and such release or vacating  of  the  warrant  may  be
      recorded  in  the  office of any recording officer in which such warrant
      has been filed. The clerk shall thereupon cancel and discharge as of the
      original date of docketing the vacated warrant.

Section 11-1615 ::    
        
     
        §  11-1615  Penalties  and  interest.  a. Any person failing to file a
      return or to pay any tax to the commissioner of finance within the  time
      required  by  this chapter shall be subject to a penalty of five percent
      of the amount of tax due; plus interest at the rate of  one  percent  of
      such  tax  for  each month of delay excepting the first month after such
      return was required to  be  filed  or  such  tax  became  due;  but  the
      commissioner  of  finance if satisfied that the delay was excusable, may
      remit all or any part of such penalty, but not interest at the  rate  of
      six  percent  per  year.  Such  penalties and interest shall be paid and
      disposed of in the same manner as  other  revenues  from  this  chapter.
      Unpaid  penalties and interest may be enforced in the same manner as the
      tax imposed by this chapter.
        b. Any seller or  supplier  or  any  retailer  or  any  officer  of  a
      corporate  seller  or  supplier or retailer, failing to file a return as
      required by this chapter, or filing or causing to be filed or making  or
      causing  to  be  made  or  given  or  causing  to  be  given any return,
      certificate,  affidavit,  representation,  information,   testimony   or
      statement  required  or  authorized  by  this chapter which is willfully
      false, and any seller or supplier or any retailer or any  officer  of  a
      corporate  seller  or  supplier  or retailer failing to keep the records
      required by subdivision six of section 11-1602 of this  chapter,  shall,
      in  addition  to the penalties herein or elsewhere prescribed, be guilty
      of a misdemeanor, punishment for which shall be a fine of not more  than
      one thousand dollars or imprisonment for not more than one year, or both
      such fine and imprisonment. It shall not be any defense to a prosecution
      under  this  subdivision  that  the failure to file a return or that the
      actions  or  failures  to  act  mentioned  in   this   subdivision   was
      unintentional or not willful.
        c. The certificate of the commissioner of finance to the effect that a
      tax  has  not  been  paid,  that  a  return  has not been filed, or that
      information has not been supplied pursuant to  the  provisions  of  this
      chapter, shall be presumptive evidence thereof.

Section 11-1616 ::    
        
     
        §  11-1616  Return  to  be secret. a. Except in accordance with proper
      judicial order, or as otherwise provided by law, it  shall  be  unlawful
      for  the  commissioner  of  finance,  any  officer  or  employee  of the
      department of finance, any person engaged or retained on an  independent
      contract  basis or any person who, pursuant to this section is permitted
      to inspect any return or to whom a copy, an abstract or a portion of any
      return is furnished, or to whom any information contained in any  return
      is  furnished,  to  divulge  or make known in any manner any information
      contained in or relating to any return required under this chapter.  The
      officers  charged with the custody of such returns shall not be required
      to produce any of them or evidence of anything contained in them in  any
      action  or proceeding in any court, except on behalf of the commissioner
      of finance in an action or  proceeding  under  the  provisions  of  this
      chapter, or on behalf of any party to any action or proceeding under the
      provisions  of this chapter, when the returns or facts shown thereby are
      directly involved in such action  or  proceeding,  in  either  of  which
      events  the  court  may  require  the  production  of,  and may admit in
      evidence, so much of said returns or of the facts shown thereby, as  are
      pertinent  to the action or proceeding and no more. Nothing herein shall
      be construed to prohibit the delivery to a taxpayer or  such  taxpayer's
      duly  authorized  representative of a certified copy of any return filed
      in connection with such taxpayer's tax; nor to prohibit the delivery  of
      such  a certified copy of such return or of any information contained in
      or relating thereto, the United States  of  America  or  any  department
      thereof,  to  the state of New York or any department thereof, or to any
      agency or department of the city of  New  York,  provided  the  same  is
      requested  for  official  business;  nor  to prohibit the inspection for
      official business of such returns by the corporation  counsel  or  other
      legal  representatives  of  the  city or by the district attorney of any
      county within the city; nor to prohibit the publication of statistics so
      classified as to prevent the identification of  particular  returns  and
      the  items  thereof.  Returns  shall  be  preserved  for three years and
      thereafter  until  the  commissioner  of  finance  permits  them  to  be
      destroyed.
        b.  Any violation of subdivision a of this section shall be punishable
      by a fine not exceeding one thousand dollars,  or  by  imprisonment  not
      exceeding  one year, or both, in the discretion of the court, and if the
      offender be an officer or employee of  the  city  he  or  she  shall  be
      dismissed  from office and be incapable of holding any public office for
      a period of five years thereafter.

Section 11-1617 ::    
        
     
        § 11-1617 Notices and limitations of time. a. Any notice authorized or
      required  under  the  provisions of this chapter may be given by mailing
      the same to the person for whom it is intended in  a  postpaid  envelope
      addressed  to  such person at the address given in the last return filed
      by such person pursuant to the provisions of  this  chapter  or  in  any
      application  made  by  such  person  or,  if no return has been filed or
      application made, then to such address as may be obtainable. The mailing
      of such notice shall be presumptive evidence of the receipt of the  same
      by  the person to whom addressed. Any period of time which is determined
      according to the provisions of this chapter  by  the  giving  of  notice
      shall commence to run from the date of mailing of such notice.
        b. The provisions of the civil practice law and rules or any other law
      relative  to  limitations  of time for the enforcement of a civil remedy
      shall not apply to any proceeding or action taken by the city  to  levy,
      appraise,  assess,  determine  or  enforce  the collection of any tax or
      penalty provided by this chapter. However,  except  in  the  case  of  a
      willfully  false  or  fraudulent return with intent to evade the tax, no
      assessment of additional tax shall be made after the expiration of  more
      than  three  years  from  the  date of the filing of a return; provided,
      however, that where no return has been filed as provided by law the  tax
      may be assessed at any time.
        c.  Where,  before  the expiration of the period prescribed herein for
      assessment of an additional tax, a taxpayer  has  consented  in  writing
      that  such period be extended, the amount of such additional tax due may
      be determined at any time within such extended  period.  The  period  so
      extended  may be further extended by subsequent consents in writing made
      before the expiration of the extended period.
