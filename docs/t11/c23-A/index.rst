      who  is subject to the provisions of this chapter shall be liable to the

      further liability for such surcharge.
        (b)  The  service  supplier shall have no obligation to take any legal
      action to enforce the collection of any surcharge. However, whenever the
      service supplier remits the funds collected  as  the  surcharge  to  the

      customer refusing or failing  to  pay  the  surcharge  imposed  by  this
      chapter and shall state the amount of such surcharge remaining unpaid.
    
    
    
    
    
    
    

Section 11-2327
---------------

Section 11-2327 ::    
        
     
        §  11-2327 System revenues; adjustment of surcharge. (a) All surcharge
      monies remitted to the commissioner of finance by a service supplier and
      all other monies dedicated to the payment of system costs from  whatever
      source  derived  or  received  by the city of New York shall be expended
      only upon authorization of the council, and only for payment  of  system
      costs  as  permitted  by  this chapter. The finance commissioner and the
      director of the office of management and budget shall separately account
      for and keep adequate records of the  amount  and  source  of  all  such
      revenues  and  of  the  amount and object or purpose of all expenditures
      thereof.
        (b) If at the end of any fiscal year the  total  amount  of  all  such
      revenues  exceeds  the  amount  necessary for payment of system costs in
      such fiscal year, such excess shall be reserved and carried over for the
      payment of system costs in the following fiscal year in conformance with
      applicable law. However, if at the end of  any  fiscal  year  such  E911
      reserved  fund  balance exceeds an amount equal to five per cent of that
      necessary for the payment of system  costs  in  such  fiscal  year,  the
      council shall by local law reduce the surcharge for the following fiscal
      year   to  a  level  that  more  adequately  reflects  the  system  cost
      requirements of its E911 system. The council  may  also  reestablish  or
      increase  such  surcharge,  subject  to  the provisions of section three
      hundred three of the county law,  if  the  revenues  generated  by  such
      surcharge  and  by  any  other source are not adequate to pay for system
      costs.
