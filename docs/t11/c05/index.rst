      as  an  employee or as an officer or director of a corporation, society,
      association, or political entity, or as a fiduciary, shall not be deemed

      short positions, and similar  financial  instruments)  in  any  property
      described  above, and any commodity traded on or subject to the rules of
      a board of trade or  commodity  exchange,  provided,  however,  property

      treated  as  acquiring,  holding  or  disposing  of  an  interest  in an
      unincorporated entity as an investor if: (i) the  unincorporated  entity
      meets  the  requirements  of  subparagraph (B) of paragraph four of this
      subdivision and the taxpayer does not receive a  distributive  share  of
      such  entity's  income,  gain,  loss, deduction, credit and basis from a
      business carried on in whole or in part in the city that  is  materially
      greater  than  its distributive share of any other item of income, gain,
      loss deduction, credit or basis of such entity; or (ii) with respect  to
      any  other  unincorporated  entity,  the  taxpayer  is neither a general
      partner nor authorized under the entity's governing instrument to manage

      business of the unincorporated entity.
        (2)  An  individual or other unincorporated entity, except a dealer as
      defined in subdivision (1) of section 11-501 of this chapter, shall  not
      be  deemed engaged in an unincorporated business solely by reason of (A)
      the purchase, holding and sale for  his,  her  or  its  own  account  of
      property,  as defined in paragraph one of this subdivision, or the entry
      into, assumption, offset, assignment, or other termination of a position
      in any property so defined, or both, (B)  the  acquisition,  holding  or
      disposition,  other  than in the ordinary course of a trade or business,
      of interests in unincorporated entities  engaged  solely  in  activities
      described  in subparagraph (A), (B) or (C) of this paragraph, or (C) any
      combination of the activities described in subparagraphs (A) and (B)  of
      this  paragraph  and  any  other activity not otherwise constituting the
      conduct of an unincorporated business subject to the tax imposed by this
      chapter, but this paragraph shall not apply if the unincorporated entity
      is taxable as a corporation for federal income tax purposes.
        (3) Notwithstanding anything  to  the  contrary,  the  receipt  by  an
      individual  or  other  unincorporated  entity  of  twenty-five  thousand
      dollars or less of gross receipts during the  taxable  year  (determined
      without regard to any deductions) from an unincorporated business wholly
      or   partly   carried   on   within  the  city  by  such  individual  or
      unincorporated  entity  shall  not  cause  such  individual   or   other
      unincorporated  entity  to  be  treated  as  not  engaged  solely in the
      activities described in subparagraph (A), (B) or (C) of paragraph two of
      this subdivision.
        (4) (A) If a taxpayer that is an unincorporated  entity  is  primarily
      engaged  in  (i) activities described in subparagraph (A), (B) or (C) of
      paragraph two of this subdivision, or (ii) the acquisition,  holding  or
      disposition,  other  than in the ordinary course of a trade or business,
      of interests as an investor in unincorporated entities carrying  on  any
      unincorporated  business  in  whole or in part in the city, or both, the
      activities described in subparagraph (A), (B), or (C) of  paragraph  two
      of  this subdivision carried on by the taxpayer or by any unincorporated
      entity primarily engaged in the activities described in  clause  (i)  or
      (ii)  of  this subparagraph in which the taxpayer owns an interest shall
      not be deemed an unincorporated business carried on by the taxpayer.
    
        (B)  For  purposes  of  subparagraph  (A)  of   this   paragraph,   an
      unincorporated entity will be treated as primarily engaged in activities
      described  in  clause (i) or (ii) of subparagraph (A) of this paragraph,
      or both, if at least ninety percent of the value of its total assets  is
      represented by assets described in subparagraph (C) of this paragraph.
        (C)  For  purposes  of  subparagraph  (B)  of  this  paragraph, assets
      described in this subparagraph include:
        (i) property as defined in paragraph one of this subdivision;
        (ii)  interests  in  unincorporated  entities  not  carrying  on   any
      unincorporated business in whole or in part in the city; and
        (iii)   interests   in   unincorporated   entities   carrying   on  an
      unincorporated business in whole or in part in  the  city  held  by  the
      taxpayer   as   an  investor,  as  defined  in  paragraph  one  of  this
      subdivision.
        (D)  For  purposes  of  determining  whether  a  taxpayer  meets   the
      requirements  of subparagraph (B) of this paragraph, the value of assets
      described in subparagraph (C) of this paragraph  shall  be  the  average
      monthly  gross value of the assets of the taxpayer. For purposes of this
      paragraph, the value of assets of the  taxpayer  that  consist  of  real
      property or marketable securities shall be the fair market value thereof
      and  the  value  of  assets  other  than  real  property  or  marketable
      securities shall be the value thereof shown on the books and records  of
      the   taxpayer   in   accordance   with  generally  accepted  accounting
      principles. In case it shall appear to the commissioner of finance  that
      the  use  of  gross  value  in  determining  whether the requirements of
      subparagraph (B) of this paragraph are met, improperly  or  inaccurately
      reflects  the taxpayer's primary activities, the commissioner of finance
      is authorized in his or her discretion and in such manner as he  or  she
      may  determine,  to  reduce  the gross value of the taxpayer's assets by
      liabilities attributable thereto  or  to  eliminate  assets,  so  as  to
      properly and accurately reflect the taxpayer's primary activities.
        (d)  Holding,  leasing  or  managing  real  property. An owner of real
      property, a lessee or a fiduciary shall not  be  deemed  engaged  in  an
      unincorporated business solely by reason of holding, leasing or managing
      real  property.  If  an  owner  of  real property or lessee or fiduciary
      (except a dealer holding real property primarily for sale  to  customers
      in  the ordinary course of his or her trade or business) who is holding,
      leasing or managing real property is also carrying on an  unincorporated
      business  in  whole  or  in  part  in  the  city,  whether  or  not such
      unincorporated business is carried on at or is connected with such  real
      property,  such  holding, leasing or managing of real property shall not
      be deemed an unincorporated business if, and only to  the  extent  that,
      such  real  property  is  held,  leased  or  managed  for the purpose of
      producing rental income from such real property or gain upon the sale or
      other  disposition  of  such  real  property.  For  purposes   of   this
      subdivision,  the  conduct  by  such owner, lessee or fiduciary, at such
      real  property,  of  a  trade,  business,  profession   or   occupation,
      including,  but  not limited to, a garage, restaurant, laundry or health
      club, shall be deemed to be an  incident  to  the  holding,  leasing  or
      managing  of  such real property, and shall not be deemed the conduct of
      an unincorporated business,  if  such  trade,  business,  profession  or
      occupation  is  conducted solely for the benefit of tenants at such real
      property, as an incidental service to such tenants, and is not  open  or
      available  to  the general public, provided, however, if any such owner,
      lessee or fiduciary operates a garage,  parking  lot  or  other  similar
      facility  at such real property that is open or available to the general
      public, the provision by any such owner,  lessee  or  fiduciary  of  the
      service  of  parking, garaging or storing of motor vehicles on a monthly
    
      or longer term basis shall be deemed to be an incident to  the  holding,
      leasing  or  managing of such real property, and shall not be deemed the
      conduct of an unincorporated business if, and only to the  extent  that,
      such  monthly  or  longer  term  parking, garaging or storing service is
      provided to tenants at such real property as an  incidental  service  to
      such  tenants.  If  an  owner,  lessee  or fiduciary holding, leasing or
      managing real property operates at such real property a garage,  parking
      lot  or  other similar facility that is open or available to the public,
      each such owner, lessee or fiduciary shall file, together with and as  a
      part  of  the  returns  required under section 11-514 of this chapter, a
      report or schedule for each such garage, parking lot  or  other  similar
      facility,  or  in  the  discretion  of the commissioner, make a separate
      entry on such returns, identifying the specific  location  and  address,
      license number and licensed capacity of each such garage, parking lot or
      other  similar  facility, and shall include such additional information,
      data and other matters relating to the  provision  of  such  monthly  or
      longer  term parking, garaging or storing service to tenants as shall be
      prescribed by the commissioner of finance. If the  separate  information
      required  to  be  reported  by  any  owner, lessee or fiduciary holding,
      leasing or managing real property for any garage, parking lot  or  other
      similar  facility at such real property that is open or available to the
      public is not contained in the returns required under section 11-514  of
      this  chapter,  or  in any amended returns, in any material respect, the
      provision of parking, garaging or storing service  to  tenants  at  such
      real  property shall be deemed the conduct of an unincorporated business
      and not incident to the  holding,  leasing  or  managing  of  such  real
      property.
        (e)  Sales representative. An individual, other than one who maintains
      an office or who  employs  one  or  more  assistants  or  who  otherwise
      regularly  carries  on  a  business,  shall  not be deemed engaged in an
      unincorporated business  solely  by  reason  of  selling  goods,  wares,
      merchandise  or  insurance for more than one enterprise. For purposes of
      this subdivision, space utilized solely for the display  of  merchandise
      and/or  for  the maintenance and storage of records normally used in the
      course of business shall not be deemed an office, and the employment  of
      clerical  and  secretarial assistance shall not be deemed the employment
      of assistants.
        (f) Exempt trusts and organizations. A trust or  other  unincorporated
      organization  which  by  reason  of its purposes or activities is exempt
      from federal income tax shall not be deemed an  unincorporated  business
      (regardless  of  whether  subject  to  federal  income  tax on unrelated
      business taxable income).

      hundred  dollars,  a credit shall be allowed in the amount determined by
      multiplying such tax by a  fraction  the  numerator  of  which  is  five
      thousand  four  hundred  dollars  minus  the  amount of such tax and the
      denominator of which is two thousand dollars; or
        (C) if the tax computed under subdivision (a) of this section is  five
      thousand four hundred dollars or more, no credit shall be allowed.
        (4)  If  separate partnerships, joint ventures or other unincorporated
      entities have substantially the same partners or members, each  of  such
      partners  or members has substantially the same interest in each of such
    
      partnerships, joint ventures or other unincorporated entities, and  such
      partnerships,  joint  ventures  or  other  unincorporated  entities  are
      engaged  in  substantially  the  same  business  or  businesses  or   in
      substantially  related  businesses,  all  of  such  partnerships,  joint
      ventures or other  unincorporated  entities  shall  be  treated  as  one
      unincorporated  business for purposes of this subdivision. The preceding
      sentence shall not be construed  to  limit  or  affect  the  meaning  or
      application of any other provision of this chapter.

      other credit permitted under this section, a taxpayer shall be allowed a
      credit, to be credited or refunded in the manner hereinafter provided in
      this subdivision, against the tax imposed  by  this  chapter  after  the
      allowance  of  any  other  credit under this section. The amount of such
      credit shall be fifty percent of  the  tax  incurred  in  market  making
      transactions  under  the  provisions of article twelve of the tax law on
      such transactions subject to such tax  occurring  on  and  after  August
      first,  nineteen  hundred  seventy-six and paid by such taxpayer (except
      when such tax shall have been  paid  pursuant  to  section  two  hundred

      as amended, and acting  as  a  dealer  in  a  transaction  described  in
      subparagraph (b) of this paragraph, and
        (b)  the  term  "market making transaction" shall mean any transaction
      involving a sale (including a short sale)  by  a  dealer  of  shares  or
      certificates  subject  to  the  tax imposed by article twelve of the tax
      law, provided such shares or certificates are sold:
        (i) as stock in trade or inventory or as property held for sale in the
      ordinary course of such dealer's trade or business (including  transfers
      which are part of an underwriting),
        (ii)  in  (a) a bona fide arbitrage transaction; (b) a bona fide hedge
      transaction involving a long or short position in  any  equity  security
      and  a  long  or  short  position  in a security entitling the holder to
      acquire  or  sell  such  equity  security;  or  (c)  a  risk   arbitrage
      transaction  in  connection  with  a  merger, acquisition, tender offer,
      recapitalization, reorganization, or similar transaction, or
        (iii) to offset a transaction made in error.
        Provided, however, that, except as to subclause (c) of clause (ii)  of
      subparagraph (b) of this paragraph, the term "market making transaction"
      shall  not include any sale of shares or certificates identified in such
      dealer's records as a security held for investment within the meaning of
      section twelve hundred thirty-six of the internal revenue code.
        (3) The credit allowed under this subdivision  for  any  taxable  year
      shall  be  deemed  to  be  an  overpayment  of tax by the taxpayer to be
      credited or refunded in accordance with the provisions of section 11-526
      of this chapter, except as otherwise  provided  in  subdivision  (g)  of
      sections  11-512 and 11-514 of this chapter; provided, however, that the
      provisions of this chapter notwithstanding, the amount  to  be  refunded
      pursuant to this subdivision shall not be paid prior to the first day of
      the  eighth  month  following  the  close  of  the taxable year, and the
      provisions  of  subdivision  (c)  of  section  11-528  of  this  chapter
      notwithstanding,  interest  shall be allowed and paid on the overpayment
    
      of the credit under this subdivision from the first day of the  eleventh
      month  following  the close of the taxable year, or three months after a
      claim for the credit or refund provided for in this subdivision has been
      filed, whichever is later.
        (4) Provided, however, that the credit provided under this subdivision
      shall  be allowed only to the extent that the amount of credit allowable
      with respect to market making transactions under the provisions of  this
      subdivision  (determined  without  regard  to  the  provisions  of  this
      paragraph) exceeds fifty percent of all rebates (provided for under  the
      provisions  of section two hundred eighty-a of article twelve of the tax
      law)  allowed  for  such  taxes  incurred  in  the  same  market  making
      transactions  with  respect to which the credit is determined. No credit
      shall be allowed under this subdivision with respect to any tax incurred
      in market making transactions  occurring  on  or  after  October  first,
      nineteen hundred eighty-one.

      provided in this section. The amount of such credit shall be the  excess
      of (A) the amount of sales and compensating use taxes imposed by section
      eleven  hundred  seven of the tax law during the taxpayer's taxable year
      which became legally due on or after and  was  paid  on  or  after  July
      first, nineteen hundred seventy-seven, less any credit or refund of such
      taxes,  with respect to the purchase or use by the taxpayer of machinery
      or equipment for use or consumption directly and  predominantly  in  the
      production    of   tangible   personal   property,   gas,   electricity,
      refrigeration  or  steam  for  sale,   by   manufacturing,   processing,
      generating,  assembling,  refining,  mining  or extracting, or telephone

      or  initiating  and  switching telephone or telegraph communication, but
      not including parts with a useful life of one year or less or  tools  or
      supplies  used in connection with such machinery, equipment or apparatus
      over (B) the amount of any credit for such sales  and  compensating  use
      taxes  allowed  or allowable against the taxes imposed by subchapter two
      of chapter eleven of this title, for any  periods  embraced  within  the
      taxable year of the taxpayer under this chapter.
        (2)  The  credit allowed under this section for any taxable year shall
      be deemed to be an overpayment of tax by the taxpayer to be credited  or
      refunded, without interest, in accordance with the provisions of section
      11-526 of this chapter.
        (3)  Where the taxpayer receives a refund or credit of any tax imposed
      under section eleven hundred seven of the tax law for which the taxpayer
      had claimed a credit under the provisions of this  section  in  a  prior
      taxable  year, the amount of such tax refund or credit shall be added to
      the tax imposed by this section, and such amount shall be subtracted  in
      computing unincorporated business taxable income for the taxable year.
        (e)  Credit  relating  to the annual increase in certain payments to a
      landlord by a taxpayer relocating industrial and  commercial  employment
      opportunities.
        (1)  In  addition  to  any  other  credit  allowed  by this section, a
      taxpayer shall be allowed a credit  against  the  tax  imposed  by  this
      chapter  to  be  credited  or  refunded, without interest, in the manner
      hereinafter provided in this section.
        (A) Where a taxpayer shall have relocated to the city from a  location
      outside  the  state, and by such relocation shall have created a minimum
      of one hundred industrial or commercial  employment  opportunities,  and
    
      where  such  taxpayer  shall  have  entered into a written lease for the
      relocation premises, the terms of  which  lease  provide  for  increased
      additional  payments to the landlord which are based solely and directly
      upon any increase or addition in real estate taxes imposed on the leased
      premises, the taxpayer upon approval and certification by the industrial
      and commercial incentive board as hereinafter provided shall be entitled
      to  a credit against the tax imposed by this chapter. The amount of such
      credit shall be: An  amount  equal  to  the  annual  increased  payments
      actually  made  by  the  taxpayer  to  the landlord which are solely and
      directly attributable to an increase or addition to the real estate  tax
      imposed  upon  the leased premises. Such credit shall be allowed only to
      the extent that the taxpayer has not otherwise claimed said amount as  a
      deduction against the tax imposed by this chapter.
        The  industrial  and  commercial  incentive  board  in  approving  and
      certifying to the qualifications of the  taxpayer  to  receive  the  tax
      credit  provided for herein shall first determine that the applicant has
      met the requirements of this section, and further, that the granting  of
      the  tax  credit  to  the  applicant  is  in  the  "public interest." In
      determining that the granting  of  the  tax  credit  is  in  the  public
      interest,  the  board shall make affirmative findings that: the granting
      of the tax credit to the applicant will not effect an undue hardship  on
      similar taxpayers already located within the city; the existence of this
      tax  incentive has been instrumental in bringing about the relocation of
      the applicant to the city; and the  granting  of  the  tax  credit  will
      foster the economic recovery and economic development of the city.
        The  tax  credit,  if  approved  and  certified  by the industrial and
      commercial incentive board, must be utilized annually  by  the  taxpayer
      for  the  length  of the term of the lease or for a period not to exceed
      ten years from the date of relocation, whichever period is shorter.

      employment opportunities. The credit shall be allowed against employment
      opportunity relocation costs incurred by the taxpayer. Such credit shall

      the  certifications required by chapter six-B of title twenty-two of the
      code shall be allowed a credit against the tax imposed by this  chapter.
      The  amount  of the credit shall be the amount determined by multiplying

      for  a  relocation  to eligible premises located within a revitalization

      thousand  dollars, by the number of eligible aggregate employment shares
      maintained  by  the  taxpayer  during  the  taxable year with respect to
      particular premises to  which  the  taxpayer  has  relocated;  provided,
      however,  with  respect  to  a relocation for which no application for a
      certificate of  eligibility  is  submitted  prior  to  July  first,  two
      thousand   three,   to   eligible   premises   that  are  not  within  a
      revitalization area, if  the  date  of  such  relocation  as  determined
      pursuant to subdivision (j) of section 22-621 of the code is before July
      first,  nineteen hundred ninety-five, the amount to be multiplied by the
      number of eligible aggregate employment shares  shall  be  five  hundred
      dollars, and with respect to a relocation for which no application for a
      certificate  of  eligibility  is  submitted  prior  to  July  first, two
      thousand three, to eligible premises that are  within  a  revitalization
      area,  if  the  date  of  such  relocation  as  determined  pursuant  to
      subdivision (j) of such section is before July first,  nineteen  hundred
      ninety-five,  the  amount  to  be  multiplied  by the number of eligible
      aggregate employment shares shall be five hundred dollars,  and  if  the
      date  of  such  relocation  as determined pursuant to subdivision (j) of

      however, that no credit shall be  allowed  for  the  relocation  of  any
      retail  activity  or  hotel  services; provided, further, that no credit
      shall be allowed under this subdivision to any taxpayer that has elected
      pursuant to subdivision (d) of section 22-622 of the code to  take  such
      credit against a gross receipts tax imposed under chapter eleven of this
      title;  and  provided  that in the case of an eligible business that has
      obtained  pursuant  to  chapter   six-B   of   such   title   twenty-two
      certifications  of eligibility for more than one relocation, the portion
      of the total amount  of  eligible  aggregate  employment  shares  to  be
      multiplied  by  the  dollar  amount specified in this paragraph for each
      such certification  of  a  relocation  shall  be  the  number  of  total
      attributed  eligible aggregate employment shares determined with respect
      to such relocation pursuant to subdivision (o) of section 22-621 of  the
      code.  For  purposes  of this subdivision, the terms "eligible aggregate
      employment shares," "relocate," "retail activity" and  "hotel  services"
      shall have the meanings ascribed by section 22-621 of the code.
        (2) The credit allowed under this subdivision with respect to eligible
      aggregate  employment  shares  maintained  with  respect  to  particular
      premises to which the taxpayer has relocated shall be  allowed  for  the
      first  taxable  year  during  which  such  eligible aggregate employment
      shares are maintained with respect to such premises and for any  of  the
      twelve   succeeding   taxable  years  during  which  eligible  aggregate
      employment shares are maintained with respect to such premises; provided
      that the credit allowed for the twelfth succeeding taxable year shall be
      calculated by multiplying the number of  eligible  aggregate  employment
      shares   maintained  with  respect  to  such  premises  in  the  twelfth
      succeeding taxable year  by  the  lesser  of  one  and  a  fraction  the
      numerator  of  which  is  such  number  of  days  in the taxable year of
      relocation less the number of  days  the  eligible  business  maintained
      employment  shares  in  the  eligible  premises  in  the taxable year of
      relocation and the denominator of which is the number of  days  in  such
      twelfth  succeeding  taxable  year  during which such eligible aggregate
      employment shares are maintained with respect to such  premises.  Except
      as  provided in paragraph four of this subdivision, if the amount of the
      credit allowable under this subdivision for any taxable year exceeds the
      tax imposed for such year, the excess may be carried over, in order,  to
    
      the  five  immediately  succeeding  taxable years and, to the extent not
      previously deductible, may be deducted from the taxpayer's tax for  such
      years.
        (3)  The  credit  allowable  under  this subdivision shall be deducted
      after the credits allowed by subdivisions (b) and (j) of  this  section,
      but prior to the deduction of any other credit allowed by this section.
        (4)  In  the  case  of a taxpayer that has obtained a certification of
      eligibility pursuant to chapter six-B of title twenty-two  of  the  code
      dated  on or after July first, two thousand for a relocation to eligible
      premises located within the revitalization area defined  in  subdivision
      (n)  of  section  22-621  of  the  code,  the credits allowed under this
      subdivision, or in the case of a taxpayer that has relocated  more  than
      once,  the  portion  of such credits attributed to such certification of
      eligibility pursuant to paragraph one of this subdivision,  against  the
      tax  imposed by this chapter for the taxable year of such relocation and
      for the four taxable years immediately succeeding the  taxable  year  of
      such  relocation,  shall  be  deemed  to  be  overpayments of tax by the
      taxpayer to be credited or refunded,  without  interest,  in  accordance
      with  the provisions of section 11-526 of this chapter. For such taxable
      years, such credits or portions thereof may not be carried over  to  any
      succeeding  taxable  year;  provided, however, that this paragraph shall
      not apply to any relocation for which an application for a certification
      of eligibility was not submitted  prior  to  July  first,  two  thousand
      three, unless the date of such relocation is on or after July first, two
      thousand.
        (j)  (1)  If  a partner in an unincorporated business is taxable under
      this chapter and is  required  to  include  in  unincorporated  business
      taxable  income his, her or its distributive share of income, gain, loss
      and deductions of, or  guaranteed  payments  from,  such  unincorporated
      business, such partner shall be allowed a credit against the tax imposed
      by  this  chapter  equal  to  the  lesser  of  the amounts determined in
      subparagraphs (A) and (B) of this paragraph:
        (A) The amount determined in this subparagraph is the product  of  (i)
      the  sum  of  (I)  the tax imposed by this chapter on the unincorporated
      business for its taxable year ending within or with the taxable year  of
      the  partner and paid by the unincorporated business and (II) the amount
      of any credit or credits taken by the unincorporated business under this
      section (except the credit allowed by subdivision (b) of  this  section)
      for  its  taxable  year  ending  within  or with the taxable year of the
      partner,  to  the  extent  that  such  credits  do   not   reduce   such
      unincorporated  business's  tax  below  zero,  and  (ii) a fraction, the
      numerator of which is the net total of the partner's distributive  share
      of  income,  gain, loss and deductions of, and guaranteed payments from,
      the unincorporated business for such taxable year, and  the  denominator
      of  which  is  the  sum,  for  such  taxable  year,  of  the  net  total
      distributive shares  of  income,  gain,  loss  and  deductions  of,  and
      guaranteed  payments to, all partners in the unincorporated business for
      whom or which such net total (as separately determined for each partner)
      is greater than zero.
        (B) The amount determined  in  this  subparagraph  is  the  difference
      between   (i)   the  tax  computed  pursuant  to  this  chapter  on  the
      unincorporated business taxable income of the partner, without allowance
      of any credits allowed by this section, and (ii) the  tax  so  computed,
      determined  as  if  the  partner  had  no  such  distributive  share  or
      guaranteed  payments  with  respect  to  the  unincorporated   business,
      provided,  however, that the amounts computed in clauses (i) and (ii) of
      this subparagraph shall be computed with the following modifications:
    
        (I) such amounts shall be computed without  taking  into  account  any
      carryforward or carryback by the partner of a net operating loss;
        (II)  if,  prior  to  taking  into  account  any distributive share or
      guaranteed  payments  from  any  unincorporated  business  or  any   net
      operating  loss  carryforward  or carryback, the unincorporated business
      taxable income of the partner is less  than  zero,  such  unincorporated
      business taxable income shall be treated as zero; and
        (III)  if such partner's net total distributive share of income, gain,
      loss and deductions of, and guaranteed payments from, any unincorporated
      business is less than zero, such net total shall be treated as zero. The
      amount determined in this subparagraph shall not be less than zero.
        (2) (A) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in paragraph  one  of
      this subdivision, the credit or the sum of the credits that may be taken
      by  a  partner for a taxable year under this subdivision with respect to
      an unincorporated business or unincorporated businesses in which he, she
      or  it  is  a  partner  shall  not  exceed  the  tax  imposed   on   the
      unincorporated  business  taxable  income  of  such  partner  under this
      chapter for such taxable  year  reduced  by  the  credit  allowed  under
      subdivision  (b)  of this section. If the credit allowed under paragraph
      one of this subdivision or the sum of such credits exceeds such  tax  as
      so  reduced,  the amount of the excess may be carried forward, in order,
      to each of the seven immediately succeeding taxable years  and,  to  the
      extent  not  previously  taken,  shall be allowed as a credit in each of
      such years. In applying the provisions of the  preceding  sentence,  the
      credit  determined  for  the  taxable  year  under paragraph one of this
      subdivision  shall  be  taken  before  taking  any  credit  carryforward
      pursuant  to  this paragraph and the credit carryforward attributable to
      the earliest  taxable  year  shall  be  taken  before  taking  a  credit
      carryforward attributable to a subsequent taxable year.
        (B)  Notwithstanding  anything  to the contrary in subparagraph (A) of
      this paragraph, in the case of a partner  which  is  a  partnership,  no
      credit  carryforward  to any taxable year shall be allowed unless one or
      more of the partners therein  during  such  taxable  year  were  persons
      having  a  proportionate  interest  or  interests, amounting to at least
      eighty percent of all such interests,  in  the  unincorporated  business
      gross  income  and unincorporated business deductions of the partnership
      which was allowed the credit for which a  carryforward  is  claimed.  In
      such  event,  the carryforward allowable on account of such credit shall
      not exceed the percentage of the amount otherwise allowable,  determined
      by   dividing  (i)  the  sum  of  the  proportionate  interests  in  the
      unincorporated  business  gross  income  and   unincorporated   business
      deductions  of  the  partnership,  for  the  year to which the credit is
      carried forward, attributable to such partners, by (ii) the sum of  such
      proportionate interests owned by all partners for such taxable year. The
      amount  by which the carryforward otherwise allowable exceeds the amount
      allowable pursuant to the preceding sentence shall not be a carryforward
      to any other taxable year.
        (3) The credit allowed under this subdivision shall not be allowed  to
      a  partner in an unincorporated business with respect to any tax paid by
      the unincorporated business under this  chapter  for  any  taxable  year
      beginning before July first, nineteen hundred ninety-four.
        (4)  Notwithstanding  anything  to  the contrary, the credit allowable
      under this subdivision shall  be  taken  after  the  credit  allowed  by
      subdivision  (b)  of  this section is taken, but before any other credit
      allowed by this section is taken.
        (5) The commissioner of finance of the city of New York shall  convene
      a  working  group,  consisting  of  representatives of the department of
      finance of  the  city  of  New  York  and  representatives  of  affected
    
      industries,  and  other  persons  the commissioner deems appropriate, to
      study the treatment under the unincorporated business tax of income from
      investment and real estate activities  and  the  impact  of  the  credit
      permitted  by this subdivision, including but not limited to cases where
      interests in a taxpayer are held by another taxpayer subject to  tax  on
      unincorporated  business  taxable  income  and  the  first  taxpayer  is
      entitled to claim a deduction for a net operating loss carryover and the
      second is not entitled to a corresponding deduction with the result,  in
      certain  cases, that the net income allocated to the second taxpayer may
      be subject to an effective rate of tax in excess of the rate imposed  by
      this  chapter.  In  addition, the working group shall also study the tax
      treatment of parking garages which are open or available to the  general
      public  and which also provide available space to tenants. In conducting
      such study, such working group shall take into account such  factors  as
      economic  development,  tax administration and other goals of tax policy
      and shall consider alternatives  that  would  reduce  disincentives  for
      investing  in corporations and other entities engaged in business in the
      city of New York, such as exempting income  from  investment  activities
      from the tax on unincorporated business taxable income. The commissioner
      shall  prepare  a report based on the deliberations of the working group
      on or before April fifteenth, nineteen hundred ninety-five.
        (k) Credit relating to certain sales and  compensating  use  taxes  on
      certain  services.  (1)  In addition to any other credit allowed by this
      section, a taxpayer shall be allowed a credit against the tax imposed by
      this chapter to be  credited  or  refunded  in  the  manner  hereinafter
      provided  in  this subdivision. The amount of such credit shall be equal
      to the amount of sales and compensating use  taxes  imposed  by  section
      eleven  hundred  seven of the tax law during the taxpayer's taxable year
      (and the amount of any interest imposed in connection  therewith)  which
      was  paid  after  January  first, nineteen hundred ninety-five, less any
      credit or refund of such taxes (or such interest), with respect  to  the
      purchase or use by the taxpayer of the services described in subdivision
      (b) of section eleven hundred five-b of the tax law.
        (2)  The  credit  allowed  under this subdivision for any taxable year
      shall be deemed to be an overpayment  of  tax  by  the  taxpayer  to  be
      credited   or   refunded,  without  interest,  in  accordance  with  the
      provisions of section 11-526 of this chapter.
        (3) Where the taxpayer receives a refund or credit of any tax  imposed
      under  section  eleven  hundred seven of the tax law (or of any interest
      imposed in connection therewith) for which the taxpayer  had  claimed  a
      credit  under  this  subdivision  in a prior taxable year, the amount of
      such tax (or such interest) refund or credit shall be added to  the  tax
      imposed  by  this  chapter,  and  such  amount  shall  be  subtracted in
      computing unincorporated business taxable income for the taxable year.
        (l) Lower Manhattan relocation and employment assistance  credit.  (1)
      In addition to any other credit allowed by this section, a taxpayer that
      has  obtained  the  certifications  required  by  chapter six-C of title
      twenty-two of the code shall be allowed a credit against the tax imposed
      by this chapter. The amount of the credit shall be the amount determined
      by  multiplying  three  thousand  dollars  by  the  number  of  eligible
      aggregate  employment  shares  maintained  by  the  taxpayer  during the
      taxable year with respect to eligible premises to which the taxpayer has
      relocated; provided, however, that no credit shall be  allowed  for  the
      relocation  of any retail activity or hotel services; provided, further,
      that no credit shall be allowed under this subdivision to  any  taxpayer
      that  has  elected  pursuant to subdivision (d) of section 22-624 of the
      code to take such credit against a  gross  receipts  tax  imposed  under
      chapter  eleven  of  this  title.  For purposes of this subdivision, the
    
      terms  "eligible  aggregate  employment  shares",  "eligible  premises",
      "relocate",  "retail  activity"  and  "hotel  services"  shall  have the
      meanings ascribed by section 22-623 of the code.
        (2) The credit allowed under this subdivision with respect to eligible
      aggregate employment shares maintained with respect to eligible premises
      to  which  the  taxpayer  has relocated shall be allowed for the taxable
      year of the relocation and for any  of  the  twelve  succeeding  taxable
      years  during  which eligible aggregate employment shares are maintained
      with respect to eligible premises; provided that the credit allowed  for
      the  twelfth  succeeding taxable year shall be calculated by multiplying
      the number of  eligible  aggregate  employment  shares  maintained  with
      respect  to  eligible premises in the twelfth succeeding taxable year by
      the lesser of one and a fraction the numerator of which is  such  number
      of  days  in  the taxable year of relocation less the number of days the
      taxpayer maintained  employment  shares  in  eligible  premises  in  the
      taxable year of relocation and the denominator of which is the number of
      days  in such twelfth succeeding taxable year during which such eligible
      aggregate  employment  shares  are  maintained  with  respect  to   such
      premises.
        (3)  Except  as provided in paragraph four of this subdivision, if the
      amount of the credit allowable under this subdivision  for  any  taxable
      year  exceeds  the  tax imposed for such year, the excess may be carried
      over, in order, to the five immediately succeeding taxable years and, to
      the  extent  not  previously  deductible,  may  be  deducted  from   the
      taxpayer's tax for such years.
        (4)  The  credits  allowed  under  this  subdivision,  against the tax
      imposed by this chapter for the taxable year of the relocation  and  for
      the  four  taxable years immediately succeeding the taxable year of such
      relocation, shall be deemed to be overpayments of tax by the taxpayer to
      be credited or  refunded,  without  interest,  in  accordance  with  the
      provisions  of  section  11-526 of this chapter. For such taxable years,
      such credits or  portions  thereof  may  not  be  carried  over  to  any
      succeeding taxable year.
        (5)  The  credit  allowable  under  this subdivision shall be deducted
      after the credits allowed by subdivisions  (b),  (i)  and  (j)  of  this
      section,  but prior to the deduction of any other credit allowed by this
      section.
        * (m) Film production credit. (1)  allowance  of  credit.  A  taxpayer
      which  is  a  qualified  film  production  company  as  defined  in this
      subdivision and which is subject to tax under  this  chapter,  shall  be
      allowed  a credit against the unincorporated business income tax imposed
      pursuant to this chapter, in accordance with the provisions in paragraph
      (5) of this subdivision, to be computed as hereinafter provided.
        (2) The amount of the credit shall be the product of five percent  and
      the  qualified  production costs paid or incurred in the production of a

      post  production  costs)  paid or incurred which are attributable to the
      use of tangible property or the performance of services at  a  qualified
      film  production facility in the production of such qualified film equal
      or exceed seventy-five percent of the production costs  (excluding  post
      production  costs) paid or incurred which are attributable to the use of
      tangible property or the performance of services at any film  production
      facility  within  and  without the city of New York in the production of
      such  qualified  film.  However,  if  the  qualified  production   costs
      (excluding  post  production costs) which are attributable to the use of
      tangible property or the performance of services  at  a  qualified  film
      production  facility  in  the production of such qualified film are less
      than  three  million  dollars,  then  the  portion  of   the   qualified
    
      productions  costs  attributable  to the use of tangible property or the
      performance of services in the production of such qualified film outside
      of a qualified film production facility shall be  allowed  only  if  the
      shooting days spent in the city of New York outside of a film production
      facility  in  the  production  of  such  qualified  film equal or exceed
      seventy-five percent of the total shooting days spent within and without
      the city of New York outside  of  a  film  production  facility  in  the
      production  of  such qualified film. The credit shall be allowed for the
      taxable  year  in  which  the  production  of  such  qualified  film  is
      completed.

      basis  for  the  allowance  of  the  credit  provided  for  under   this
      subdivision  or used in the calculation of the credit provided for under

      pharmacological, mechanical, and computational applications and services
      connected  with  these  improvements.  Activities  included  with   such
      applications  and  services  shall  include,  but  not  be  limited  to,
      alternative  mRNA  splicing,  DNA  sequence  amplification,  antigenetic
      switching  bioaugmentation,  bioenrichment,  bioremediation,  chromosome

      mean a person, corporation, or other entity, including an entity that is
      treated  as  a partnership or other pass-through vehicle for purposes of

        (3) An eligible taxpayer shall be allowed a credit  for  eighteen  per
      centum  of  the  cost  or other basis for federal income tax purposes of
      research and development property that is acquired by  the  taxpayer  by
      purchase  as  defined in section 179(d) of the internal revenue code and
      placed  in service during the calendar year that ends with or within the
      taxable year for which the credit is claimed. Provided, however, for the
      purposes of this paragraph only, an eligible taxpayer shall be allowed a
      credit for such percentage of the (A) cost or other  basis  for  federal
      income  tax  purposes  for property used in the testing or inspection of
      materials and products,  (B)  the  costs  or  expenses  associated  with

      sophisticated technology facilities and  processes,  (D)  fees  for  the
      production or eventual commercial distribution of materials and products
      resulting  from  the  activities of an eligible taxpayer as long as such
      activities fall under activities relating to biotechnologies. The costs,
      expenses and other amounts for which a credit  is  allowed  and  claimed
      under  this  paragraph shall not be used in the calculation of any other
      credit  allowed  under  this  subchapter.  For  the  purposes  of   this
      subdivision,  "research  and  development  property" shall mean property
      that  is  used  for  purposes  of  research  and  development   in   the

        (4) An eligible taxpayer shall be allowed a credit for nine per centum
      of  qualified  research expenses paid or incurred by the taxpayer in the
      calendar year ending with or within  the  taxable  year  for  which  the
      credit  is  claimed.  For  the  purposes of this subdivision, "qualified
      research expenses" shall mean expenses associated with in-house research
      and processes, and  costs  associated  with  the  dissemination  of  the
      results  of  the  products  that  directly result from such research and
      development activities; provided, however, that  such  costs  shall  not
      include  advertising  or  promotion  through  media.  In addition, costs
      associated  with  the  preparation  of   patent   applications,   patent
      application filing fees, patent research fees, patent examinations fees,
      patent   post   allowance  fees,  patent  maintenance  fees,  and  grant
      application expenses  and  fees  shall  qualify  as  qualified  research
      expenses. In no case shall the credit allowed under this paragraph apply
      to  expenses  for  litigation  or  the  challenge  of  another  entity's
      intellectual property rights, or for contract expenses involving outside
      paid consultants.
        (5) An eligible taxpayer shall  be  allowed  a  credit  for  qualified
      high-technology  training  expenditures  as  described in this paragraph
      paid or incurred by the taxpayer during the calendar year that ends with
      or within the taxable year for which the credit is claimed.
        (A) The amount of credit shall be one hundred percent of the  training
      expenses  described  in subparagraph (C) of this paragraph, subject to a
      limitation of no more  than  four  thousand  dollars  per  employee  per
      calendar year for such training expenses.
        (B)  Qualified  high-technology  training  shall  include  a course or
      courses taken  and  satisfactorily  completed  by  an  employee  of  the
      taxpayer  at  an  accredited,  degree granting post-secondary college or
      university  in  city  that  (i)  directly   relates   to   biotechnology
      activities,  and  (ii)  is  intended  to upgrade, retrain or improve the
      productivity or theoretical awareness of the employee.  Such  course  or
      courses  may  include,  but  are not limited to, instruction or research
      relating to techniques, meta, macro, or micro-theoretical  or  practical
    
      knowledge  bases  or  frontiers,  or  ethical  concerns  related to such
      activities. Such course or courses shall  not  include  classes  in  the
      disciplines  of  management, accounting or the law or any class designed
      to  fulfill  the discipline specific requirements of a degree program at
      the associate, baccalaureate, graduate or professional  level  of  these
      disciplines.  Satisfactory  completion of a course or courses shall mean
      the earning  and  granting  of  credit  or  equivalent  unit,  with  the
      attainment  of  a  grade  of "B" or higher in a graduate level course or
      courses, a grade of "C" or higher in an undergraduate level  courses  or

      expenses  for  tuition  and  mandatory  fees,  software  required by the
      institution, fees for textbooks or  other  literature  required  by  the
      institution   offering   the   course   or   courses,  minus  applicable
      scholarships and tuition or fee waivers not granted by the  taxpayer  or
      any  affiliates  of  the  taxpayer,  that  are paid or reimbursed by the
      taxpayer. Qualified high-technology expenditures do not include room and
      board, computer hardware or software not specifically assigned for  such
      course  or  courses,  late-charges, fines or membership dues and similar
      expenses. Such qualified expenditures shall  not  be  eligible  for  the
      credit  provided  by  this  section  unless  the  employee  for whom the
      expenditures are disbursed is continuously employed by the taxpayer in a
      full-time, full-year position primarily  located  at  a  qualified  site
      during  the  period  of such coursework and lasting through at least one
      hundred eighty days after the satisfactory completion of the  qualifying
      course-work.  Qualified  high-technology training expenditures shall not
      include expenses for in-house or  shared  training  outside  of  a  city
      higher education institution or the use of consultants outside of credit
      granting  courses,  whether  such  consultants  function  inside of such
      higher education institution or not.
        (D) If a  taxpayer  relocates  from  an  academic  business  incubator
      facility   partnered   with   an   accredited  post-secondary  education
      institution located within  city,  which  provides  space  and  business
      support  services  to taxpayers, to another site, the credit provided in
      this subdivision shall be allowed for  all  expenditures  referenced  in
      subparagraph (C) of this paragraph paid or incurred in the two preceding
      calendar  years  that  the  taxpayer  was  located  in such an incubator
      facility for employees of the  taxpayer  who  also  relocate  from  said
      incubator  facility  to  such  city  site and are employed and primarily
      located by the taxpayer in city.  Such expenditures in the two preceding
      years shall be added to the amounts otherwise qualifying for the  credit
      provided  by this subdivision that were paid or incurred in the calendar
      year that the taxpayer relocates from such a facility. Such expenditures
      shall include expenses paid for an eligible employee who is a full-time,
      full-year employee of said taxpayer during the calendar  year  that  the
      taxpayer  relocated  from an incubator facility notwithstanding (i) that
      such employee was employed full or part-time as an officer, staff-person
      or paid intern of the taxpayer when such taxpayer was  located  at  such
      incubator  facility  or  (ii)  that  such  employee was not continuously
      employed when such taxpayer was located at the incubator facility during
      the one hundred eighty day period referred to  in  subparagraph  (C)  of
      this  paragraph,  provided  such  employee  received wages or equivalent
      income for at least seven hundred fifty  hours  during  any  twenty-four
      month  period  when  the taxpayer was located at the incubator facility.
      Such expenditures shall include payments made to such employee after the
      taxpayer  has  relocated  from  the  incubator  facility  for  qualified
      expenditures  if  such  payments  are  made to reimburse an employee for
    
      expenditures paid by the employee during such two preceding  years.  The
      credit  provided  under  this  paragraph shall be allowed in any taxable
      year that the taxpayer qualifies as an eligible taxpayer.
        (E)  For  purposes  of this subdivision the term "academic year" shall
      mean the annual period  of  sessions  of  a  post-secondary  college  or
      university.
        (F)  For the purposes of this subdivision the term "academic incubator
      facility" shall mean a  facility  providing  low-cost  space,  technical
      assistance,  support  services  and educational opportunities, including
      but not limited to central services  provided  by  the  manager  of  the
      facility  to  the tenants of the facility, to an entity located in city.
      Such entity's primary activity must  be  in  biotechnologies,  and  such
      entity  must  be  in  the  formative  stage of development. The academic
      incubator facility and the  entity  must  act  in  partnership  with  an
      accredited  post-secondary  college  or  university  located in city. An
      academic incubator facility's mission shall be to promote job  creation,
      entrepreneurship,  technology  transfer, and provide support services to
      incubator tenants, including, but not  limited  to,  business  planning,
      management   assistance,   financial-packaging,  linkages  to  financing
      services, and coordinating with other sources of assistance.
        (6) An eligible taxpayer may claim credits under this subdivision  for
      three  consecutive  years.  In  no case shall the credit allowed by this
      subdivision to a taxpayer exceed two hundred fifty thousand dollars  per
      calendar year for eligible expenditures made during such calendar year.
        (7)  The  credit  allowed  under this subdivision for any taxable year
      shall not reduce the tax due for such  year  to  less  than  the  amount
      computed  in  subdivision (a) of this section. Provided, however, if the
      amount of credit allowed under this subdivision  for  any  taxable  year
      reduces  the  tax to such amount, any amount of credit not deductible in
      such taxable year shall be treated  as  an  overpayment  of  tax  to  be
      credited or refunded in accordance with the provisions of section 11-526
      of  this chapter; provided, however, that notwithstanding the provisions
      of section 11-528 of this chapter, no interest shall be paid thereon.
        (8) The credit allowed under this subdivision shall  only  be  allowed
      for  taxable years beginning on or after January first, two thousand ten
      and before January first, two thousand sixteen.
        (b)(1) The percentage of the credit allowed to a taxpayer  under  this
      subdivision in any calendar year shall be:
        (A)  If  the  average  number  of  individuals employed full time by a
      taxpayer in the city during the calendar year that ends with  or  within
      the  taxable  year  which  the credit is claimed is at least one hundred
      five percent  of  the  taxpayer's  base  year  employment,  one  hundred
      percent,  except  that  in  no  case shall the credit allowed under this
      clause exceed two hundred fifty  thousand  dollars  per  calendar  year.
      Provided,  however, the increase in base year employment shall not apply
      to a taxpayer allowed a credit  under  this  subdivision  that  was  (I)
      located  outside  of the city, (II) not doing business, or (III) did not
      have any employees, in the year preceding the first year that the credit
      is claimed. Any such taxpayer shall be eligible for one hundred  percent
      of  the  credit for the first calendar year that ends with or within the
      taxable year for  which  the  credit  is  claimed,  provided  that  such
      taxpayer locates in the city, begins doing business in the city or hires
      employees  in  the  city  during  such  calendar  year  and is otherwise
      eligible for the credit pursuant to the provisions of this subdivision.
        (B) If the average number of  individuals  employed  full  time  by  a
      taxpayer  in  the city during the calendar year that ends with or within
      the taxable year for which the  credit  is  claimed  is  less  than  one
      hundred  five  percent  of  the  taxpayer's  base year employment, fifty
    
      percent, except that in no case shall  the  credit  allowed  under  this
      clause  exceed  one  hundred  twenty  five thousand dollars per calendar
      year. In the case of an entity  located  in  city  receiving  space  and
      business  support  services  by  an  academic incubator facility, if the
      average number of individuals employed full time by such entity  in  the
      city  during  the  calendar  year in which the credit allowed under this
      subdivision is claimed is less than one  hundred  five  percent  of  the
      taxpayer's base year employment, the credit shall be zero.
        (2) For the purposes of this subdivision, "base year employment" means
      the  average number of individuals employed full-time by the taxpayer in
      the city in the year preceding the first calendar year that ends with or
      within the taxable year for which the credit is claimed.
        (3)  For  the  purposes  of  this  subdivision,  average   number   of
      individuals employed full-time shall be computed by adding the number of
      such  individuals  employed  by  the taxpayer at the end of each quarter
      during each calendar year or other applicable period  and  dividing  the
      sum  so  obtained  by  the number of such quarters occurring within such
      calendar year or other applicable period.
        (4)  Notwithstanding  anything  contained  in  this  section  to   the
      contrary,  the  credit  provided  by  this  subdivision shall be allowed
      against the taxes authorized by this chapter for the taxable year  after
      reduction by all other credits permitted by this chapter.

      beginning prior to and ending  after  January  first,  nineteen  hundred
      sixty-six.
        (a)  General.  The tax imposed by section 11-503 of this chapter, with
      any modification permitted  by  subdivision  (b)  of  this  section,  is
      imposed  for each taxable year beginning with taxable years ending on or
      after January first, nineteen hundred sixty-six.
        (b) Alternate methods for determining tax for taxable years ending  on
      or  after January first, nineteen hundred sixty-six. (1) The tax for any
      taxable  year  ending  on  or  after  January  first,  nineteen  hundred
      sixty-six  and before December thirty-first, nineteen hundred sixty-six,
      shall be an amount equal to the tax which would have  been  imposed  had
      section  11-503  of  this  chapter been in effect for the entire taxable
      year, multiplied by the number of months (or major portions thereof)  in
      such  taxable  year  which  occur  after December thirty-first, nineteen
      hundred sixty-five and  divided  by  the  number  of  months  (or  major
      portions thereof) in such taxable year.
        (2)  In  lieu  of  the  method  of  computation  of  tax prescribed in
      paragraph one of this subdivision, if the taxpayer  maintained  adequate
      records  for  the portion of any taxable year ending on or after January
      first, nineteen hundred sixty-six,  and  before  December  thirty-first,
      nineteen  hundred  sixty-six,  which  falls  within  the  calendar  year
      nineteen hundred sixty-six,  the  tax  for  such  taxable  year  at  the
      election   of  the  taxpayer  may  be  computed  on  the  basis  of  the
      unincorporated business taxable income which  the  taxpayer  would  have
      reported  had  he or she filed a federal income tax return for a taxable
      year beginning January first, nineteen hundred sixty-six and ending with
      the close of such taxable  year  ending  before  December  thirty-first,
      nineteen  hundred sixty-six.  Such taxable year beginning January first,
      nineteen hundred sixty-six  and  ending  before  December  thirty-first,
      nineteen  hundred  sixty-six  shall  be deemed (unless clearly indicated
      otherwise) to be the taxable year of the taxpayer. For purposes of  this
      paragraph,   the  unincorporated  business  exemptions  allowable  under
      section 11-510 of this chapter, the credit allowable  under  subdivision
      (b)  of  section  11-503  of  this  chapter  and  any net operating loss
      deduction as modified pursuant to subdivision two of section  11-507  of
      this  chapter shall each be reduced by the same part of such exemptions,
      credit, or net operating loss deduction (as the  case  may  be)  as  the
      number  of  months  (or  major  portions  thereof)  in  the taxable year
      occurring before January first, nineteen hundred  sixty-six  is  of  the
      number  of  months  (or  major  portions  thereof) in such taxable year.
      Except as provided in paragraph two, the  tax  for  such  period  ending
      before  December  thirty-first,  nineteen  hundred  sixty-six,  shall be
      computed in accordance with the other provisions of this chapter.

        (2) The character of a partner's distributive share of  gross  income,
      gains,  losses  and  deductions  of  an  unincorporated  entity shall be
      determined as if such gross income, gains, losses  and  deductions  were
      realized  directly by such partner regardless of how the interest in the
      unincorporated  entity  was  acquired  and  regardless  of  whether  the
      distributive share is proportionate to the partner's capital interest in
      the  unincorporated  entity, provided, however, this paragraph shall not
      apply to  payments  to  a  partner  treated  as  occurring  between  the
      unincorporated  entity  and one who is not a partner under section seven
      hundred seven of the internal revenue code, and provided, further,  this

        (1) Interest income on obligations of any state other than this state,
      or of a political subdivision of any such other state unless created  by
      compact or agreement to which this state is a party.
        (2)  Interest  or  dividend income on obligations or securities of any
      authority, commission, or instrumentality of the  United  States,  which
      the  laws  of  the  United States exempt from federal income tax but not
      from state or local income taxes.
        (3) In the case of a taxpayer who has exercised the election permitted
      by subdivision (b) of section 11-509 of this chapter, if the property to

      federal gross income but only to the extent that such taxes are incurred
      and paid in market making transactions.

      provisions of subdivision (c) of section 11-502 of this chapter.
        (15)  Notwithstanding  any  other  provision  of  this  chapter to the
      contrary, the amount allowed as an exclusion or deduction in determining
      federal gross income of any loss realized from the holding,  leasing  or
      managing  of  real  property  if,  and to the extent that, such holding,
      leasing or managing of real property is  not  deemed  an  unincorporated
      business  carried  on  by  the  taxpayer  pursuant  to the provisions of
      subdivision (d) of section 11-502 of this chapter.
    
        (16) Notwithstanding any  other  provision  of  this  chapter  to  the

        (3-a)  Fifty  percent  of  dividends to the extent includible in gross
      income  for  federal  income  tax  purposes  and  not  subtracted  under
      paragraph  two  or  three  of  this subdivision, provided, however, that
      there shall be no subtraction pursuant to this paragraph for any portion
      of a dividend from stock with respect  to  which  a  dividend  deduction

      of the internal revenue code  if  the  unincorporated  business  were  a
      corporation;
        (4) The amount of any refund or credit for overpayment of income taxes

      to each such property, and
        (b)  the  amount  of  gain  (if  smaller  than the amount described in
      subparagraph (a) of this paragraph) that would be  included  in  federal
      gross  income with respect to each such property if the federal adjusted
      basis of such property on the date of the sale or other disposition  had
      been  equal  to its fair market value on January first, nineteen hundred
      sixty-six, or the date of its sale or other disposition prior to January
      first, nineteen hundred sixty-six, plus  or  minus  all  adjustments  to
      basis made with respect to such property for federal income tax purposes

      contrary, the amount of any income or gain (to the extent includible  in
      gross income for federal income tax purposes) realized from the holding,
      leasing  or  managing  of real property if, and to the extent that, such

      unincorporated  business  carried  on  by  the  taxpayer pursuant to the
      provisions of subdivision (d) of section 11-502 of this chapter.
        (9) Notwithstanding  any  other  provision  of  this  chapter  to  the
      contrary,  the amount of any income or gain (to the extent includible in
      gross income for federal income tax purposes), including but not limited
      to, dividends, interest, payments  with  respect  to  securities  loans,
      income  from  notional  principal  contracts, or income and gains, other

      extent  that,  such activities are not deemed an unincorporated business
      carried on by the taxpayer pursuant to the provisions of subdivision (c)
      of section 11-502 of this chapter.
        (10) Notwithstanding any  other  provision  of  this  chapter  to  the
      contrary,  in  the  case  of a taxpayer that is an unincorporated entity
      described in subparagraph (B) of paragraph four of  subdivision  (c)  of
      section 11-502 of this chapter, the amount of any income or gain (to the
      extent  includible  in  gross  income  for  federal income tax purposes)
      realized from the sale or other disposition of an  interest  in  another
      unincorporated entity if, and to the extent that, such income or gain is
      attributable  to  activities  of  such  other  unincorporated entity not
      deemed an unincorporated business carried on by the taxpayer pursuant to
      the provisions of subdivision (c) of section 11-502 of this chapter.
        (11) Notwithstanding any  other  provision  of  this  chapter  to  the
      contrary,  the amount of any income or gain (to the extent includible in
      gross  income  for  federal  income  tax  purposes)  realized  from  the
      provision  by an owner, lessee or fiduciary holding, leasing or managing
      real property of the service of parking, garaging or  storing  of  motor
      vehicles  on  a  monthly  or  longer  term basis to tenants at such real
      property if, and to the extent that, the provision of such  services  to
      such  tenants  is  not deemed an unincorporated business pursuant to the
      provisions of subdivision (d) of section 11-502 of this chapter.
        (d) Upon the disposition of property to which subdivisions twenty  and
      twenty-one  of  section  11-507  apply,  the  amount of any gain or loss
      includible in entire  net  income  shall  be  adjusted  to  reflect  the
      modifications   provided  in  such  subdivisions  attributable  to  such
      property.
    
        (e) Related members expense add back.  (1)  Definitions.  (A)  Related
      member.   "Related   member"  means  a  related  person  as  defined  in
      subparagraph (c) of paragraph three of subsection (b)  of  section  four
      hundred  sixty-five  of  the  internal  revenue code, except that "fifty
      percent" shall be substituted for "ten percent".
        (B)  Effective  rate  of tax. "Effective rate of tax" means, as to any
      city, the maximum statutory rate of  tax  imposed  by  the  city  on  or
      measured   by   a   related   member's  net  income  multiplied  by  the
      apportionment percentage, if any, applicable to the related member under
      the laws of said jurisdiction. For  purposes  of  this  definition,  the
      effective  rate of tax as to any city is zero where the related member's
      net income tax liability in said city  is  reported  on  a  combined  or
      consolidated  return  including both the taxpayer and the related member
      where the reported transactions between the  taxpayer  and  the  related
      member  are eliminated or offset. Also, for purposes of this definition,
      when computing the effective rate of tax for a city in which  a  related
      member's  net  income  is  eliminated  or  offset by a credit or similar
      adjustment that is dependent upon the related member either  maintaining
      or  managing  intangible  property or collecting interest income in that
      city, the maximum statutory rate of tax imposed by said  city  shall  be
      decreased  to  reflect  the  statutory  rate  of tax that applies to the
      related  member  as  effectively  reduced  by  such  credit  or  similar
      adjustment.
        (C) Royalty payments. Royalty payments are payments directly connected
      to  the  acquisition,  use,  maintenance or management, ownership, sale,
      exchange, or any other disposition of licenses, trademarks,  copyrights,
      trade  names,  trade  dress,  service  marks, mask works, trade secrets,
      patents and any other similar types of intangible assets  as  determined
      by  the  commissioner  of  finance,  and  include  amounts  allowable as
      interest  deductions  under  section  one  hundred  sixty-three  of  the
      internal  revenue  code  to  the  extent  such  amounts  are directly or
      indirectly for, related to or in connection with the  acquisition,  use,
      maintenance  or  management, ownership, sale, exchange or disposition of
      such intangible assets.
        (D) Valid business purpose. A valid business purpose is  one  or  more
      business  purposes,  other  than the avoidance or reduction of taxation,
      which alone or in combination constitute the primary motivation for some
      business activity or transaction, which activity or transaction  changes
      in  a  meaningful  way, apart from tax effects, the economic position of
      the taxpayer. The economic position of the taxpayer includes an increase
      in the market share of the taxpayer, or the entry by the  taxpayer  into
      new business markets.
        (2)  Royalty  expense  add  backs.  (A)  For  the purpose of computing
      unincorporated business entire net income,  a  taxpayer  must  add  back
      royalty  payments  directly  or indirectly paid, accrued, or incurred in
      connection with one or more direct or indirect transactions with one  or
      more related members during the taxable year to the extent deductible in
      calculating federal taxable income.
        (B)  Exceptions. (i) The adjustment required in this subdivision shall
      not apply to the portion  of  the  royalty  payment  that  the  taxpayer
      establishes,  by  clear  and  convincing evidence of the type and in the
      form specified  by  the  commissioner  of  finance,  meets  all  of  the
      following  requirements:  (I)  the  related member was subject to tax in
      this city or another city within the United States or a  foreign  nation
      or  some  combination  thereof  on  a tax base that included the royalty
      payment paid, accrued or incurred by  the  taxpayer;  (II)  the  related
      member during the same taxable year directly or indirectly paid, accrued
      or  incurred  such portion to a person that is not a related member; and
    
      (III) the transaction giving rise to the  royalty  payment  between  the
      taxpayer  and  the  related  member  was undertaken for a valid business
      purpose.
        (ii)  The  adjustment  required in this subdivision shall not apply if
      the taxpayer establishes, by clear and convincing evidence of  the  type
      and  in the form specified by the commissioner of finance, that: (I) the
      related member was subject to tax on or measured by its  net  income  in
      this  city or another city within the United States, or some combination
      thereof; (II) the tax base for said tax  included  the  royalty  payment
      paid,  accrued  or  incurred  by  the  taxpayer; and (III) the aggregate
      effective  rate  of  tax  applied  to  the  related  member   in   those
      jurisdictions  is  no  less than eighty percent of the statutory rate of
      tax that applied to the taxpayer under section 11-503  of  this  chapter
      for the taxable year.
        (iii)  The  adjustment required in this subdivision shall not apply if
      the taxpayer establishes, by clear and convincing evidence of  the  type
      and  in the form specified by the commissioner of finance, that: (I) the
      royalty payment was paid,  accrued  or  incurred  to  a  related  member
      organized under the laws of a country other than the United States; (II)
      the  related  member's  income  from  the  transaction  was subject to a
      comprehensive income tax treaty between  such  country  and  the  United
      States;  (III) the related member was subject to tax in a foreign nation
      on a tax base  that  included  the  royalty  payment  paid,  accrued  or
      incurred  by  the  taxpayer;  (IV)  the related member's income from the
      transaction was taxed in such country at an effective  rate  of  tax  at
      least  equal  to  that imposed by this city; and (V) the royalty payment
      was paid, accrued  or  incurred  pursuant  to  a  transaction  that  was
      undertaken  for a valid business purpose and using terms that reflect an
      arm's length relationship.
        (iv) The adjustment required in this subdivision shall  not  apply  if
      the  taxpayer  and  the  commissioner of finance agree in writing to the
      application or use  of  alternative  adjustments  or  computations.  The
      commissioner  of  finance  may,  in  his or her discretion, agree to the
      application or use of alternative adjustments or computations when he or
      she concludes that in the absence of such agreement the  income  of  the
      taxpayer would not be properly reflected.
        (f)   Upon   the   disposition   of  property  to  which  subdivisions
      twenty-three and twenty-four of section 11-507 of  this  chapter  apply,
      the  amount  of  any  gain or loss includible in unincorporated business
      gross income shall be adjusted to reflect the modifications provided  in
      such subdivisions attributable to such property.

Section 11-507 ::    
        
     
        ยง   11-507  Unincorporated  business  deductions.  The  unincorporated
      business deductions of an unincorporated business  means  the  items  of
      loss and deduction directly connected with or incurred in the conduct of
      the  business,  which  are allowable for federal income tax purposes for
      the taxable year (including losses and  deductions  connected  with  any
      property employed in the business), with the following modifications:
        (1)  A  deduction shall be allowed for charitable contributions of the
      unincorporated business, to the extent that such contributions would  be
      deductible for federal income tax purposes if made by a corporation, but
      not   in  excess  of  five  per  centum  of  the  amount  by  which  the
      unincorporated  business  gross  income  exceeds  the  sum  of  (A)  the
      unincorporated  business  deductions computed without the benefit of any
      deduction for charitable contributions and  (B)  the  deduction  allowed
      under  subdivision  (b)  of  section  11-509  of this chapter, where the
      election permitted by such subsection has been exercised.
        (2) (a) A deduction shall be allowed for net operating losses incurred
      by  the  unincorporated  business,  except  as  otherwise  provided   by
      paragraph  (b)  of  this  subdivision, in an amount computed in the same
      manner as the net operating loss deduction which would  be  allowed  for
      the  taxable  year for federal income tax purposes if the unincorporated
      business were an individual taxpayer (but determined solely by reference
      to the unincorporated business gross income and unincorporated  business
      deductions,  allocated  to  the  city,  of the unincorporated business);
      provided, however, that such net operating loss deduction which would be
      allowed for the taxable year for federal income tax purposes  shall  for
      purposes  of  this  paragraph  be  determined  as  if the unincorporated
      business had elected  under  section  one  hundred  seventy-two  of  the
      internal  revenue  code  to  relinquish the entire carryback period with
      respect to net operating losses, except with respect to  the  first  ten
      thousand  dollars of each of such losses, sustained during taxable years
      ending  after  June  thirtieth,  nineteen  hundred   eighty-nine.   Such
      deduction  shall not include any net operating loss sustained during any
      taxable  year  beginning  prior  to  January  first,  nineteen   hundred
      sixty-six  and  for  the purposes of this paragraph a net operating loss
      shall be determined without regard to any deductions allowed pursuant to
      subdivision (b) of section 11-509 of this chapter and any net  operating
      loss  for  a taxable year beginning in nineteen hundred eighty-one shall
      be computed without regard to the  deduction  allowed  with  respect  to
      recovery  property under section one hundred sixty-eight of the internal
      revenue code; in lieu of such deduction, a taxpayer shall be allowed for
      such taxable  year  with  respect  to  such  property  the  depreciation
      deduction  allowable  under  section  one  hundred  sixty-seven  of such
      internal revenue code as such section was in full force  and  effect  on
      December thirty-first, nineteen hundred eighty.
        (b)  In  the case of a partnership, no net operating loss carryback or
      carryover to any taxable year shall be allowed unless one or more of the
      partners during such taxable year were persons  having  a  proportionate
      interest  or interests, amounting to at least eighty percent of all such
      interests,   in   the   unincorporated   business   gross   income   and
      unincorporated  business  deductions  of the partnership which sustained
      the loss for which a carryback or carryover is claimed. In  such  event,
      the  carryback  or carryover allowable on account of such loss shall not
      exceed the percentage of the amount otherwise allowable,  determined  by
      dividing   (A)   the   sum   of   the  proportionate  interests  in  the
      unincorporated  business  gross  income  and   unincorporated   business
      deductions of the partnership, for the year to which the loss is carried
      back  or  carried over, attributable to such partners, by (B) the sum of
      such proportionate interests owned by  all  partners  for  such  taxable
    
      year. The amount by which the carryback or carryover otherwise allowable
      exceeds  the  amount  allowable pursuant to the preceding sentence shall
      not be a carryback or carryover to any other taxable year.
        (3)  No  deduction  shall  be  allowed  (except as provided in section
      11-509 of this chapter) for amounts paid or incurred to a proprietor  or
      partner for services or for use of capital.
        (4)  No  deduction  shall  be  allowed for income taxes imposed by the
      city, this state or any other taxing jurisdiction, or the tax imposed by
      article thirteen-A of the tax law.
        (5) No deduction shall be allowed for  (A)  interest  on  indebtedness
      incurred or continued to purchase or carry obligations or securities the
      interest  on  which  is exempt from tax under this chapter; (B) expenses
      paid or incurred for the production or collection of such income or  the
      management,  conservation  or  maintenance  of  property  held  for  the
      production of such income; or (C) the amortizable bond  premium  on  any
      bond the interest income from which is so exempt.
        (6)  No  deduction  shall  be  allowed in respect of the excess of net
      long-term capital gain over net short-term  capital  loss,  but  capital
      losses  incurred  in  the  unincorporated  business  shall be treated as
      ordinary losses and shall be allowed in full.
        (7) In the case of a taxpayer who has exercised the election permitted
      by subdivision (b) of section 11-509 of this chapter, no deduction shall
      be allowed for expenditures with reference to the property to which such
      election relates, or  for  depreciation  of  such  property,  except  as
      permitted by said subdivision.
        (8)  A  deduction  shall  be  allowed (to the extent not allowable for
      federal income tax purposes) for (A) interest on  indebtedness  incurred
      or continued to purchase or carry obligations or securities the interest
      on  which  is  subject to tax under this chapter but exempt from federal
      income tax; (B) ordinary and necessary expenses paid or incurred  during
      the  taxable year for the production or collection of such income or the
      management,  conservation  or  maintenance  of  property  held  for  the
      production  of such income; and (C) the amortizable bond premium for the
      taxable year on any bond the interest on which is subject to  tax  under
      this chapter but exempt from federal income tax.
        (9)  At the election of the taxpayer, a deduction shall be allowed for
      expenditures  paid  or  incurred  during  the  taxable  year   for   the
      construction,  reconstruction,  erection  or  improvement  of industrial
      waste treatment facilities and air pollution control facilities.
        (A) (i) The term "industrial waste treatment  facilities"  shall  mean
      facilities   for  the  treatment,  neutralization  or  stabilization  of
      industrial waste (as the term "industrial waste" is defined  in  section
      17-0105  of the environmental conservation law) from a point immediately
      preceding the point of such treatment, neutralization  or  stabilization
      to   the   point  of  disposal,  including  the  necessary  pumping  and
      transmitting facilities, but excluding such facilities installed for the
      primary  purpose  of  salvaging  materials  which  are  usable  in   the
      manufacturing process or are marketable.
        (ii) The term "air pollution control facilities" shall mean facilities
      which  remove,  reduce,  or render less noxious air contaminants emitted
      from an air contamination source (as the  terms  "air  contaminant"  and
      "air  contamination  source"  are  defined  in  section  19-0107  of the
      environmental conservation law) from a point immediately  preceding  the
      point  of such removal, reduction or rendering to the point of discharge
      of air, meeting emission standards as established by the  air  pollution
      control  board,  but excluding such facilities installed for the primary
      purpose of salvaging materials which are  usable  in  the  manufacturing
      process  or are marketable and excluding those facilities which rely for
    
      their  efficacy  on  dilution,  dispersion  or   assimilation   of   air
      contaminants in the ambient air after emission.
        (B)  However, such deduction shall be allowed only (i) with respect to
      tangible property which is depreciable, pursuant to section one  hundred
      sixty-seven of the internal revenue code, having a situs in the city and
      used   in   the   taxpayer's   trade   or  business,  the  construction,
      reconstruction, erection  or  improvement  of  which,  in  the  case  of
      industrial  waste treatment facilities, is initiated on or after January
      first, nineteen hundred sixty-six, and only  for  expenditures  paid  or
      incurred prior to January first, nineteen hundred seventy-two, or which,
      in  the  case  of  air  pollution control facilities, is initiated on or
      after January first, nineteen hundred sixty-six, and
        (ii) on condition that such facilities  have  been  certified  by  the
      state   commissioner   of  environmental  conservation  or  his  or  her
      designated representative, in the same  manner  as  provided  in  either
      section  17-0707  or  19-0309  of the environmental conservation law, as
      applicable,  as  complying  with  the  provision  of  the  environmental
      conservation  law,  the sanitary code and regulations, permits or orders
      promulgated pursuant thereto, and
        (iii) on condition that  for  the  taxable  year  and  all  succeeding
      taxable years, no deduction for such expenditures or for depreciation of
      the  same  property  allowed  for  federal  income tax purposes shall be
      allowed under this chapter, except to the extent that the basis  of  the
      property may be attributable to factors other than such expenditures, or
      in  case a deduction is allowable pursuant to this subdivision, for only
      a part of such expenditures, on condition that any deduction allowed for
      federal income tax purposes for such expenditures or for depreciation of
      the same property be proportionately reduced in computing unincorporated
      business deductions for the taxable  year  and  all  succeeding  taxable
      years, and
        (iv)  where  the  election  provided for in subdivision (b) of section
      11-509 of this chapter has not been exercised in  respect  to  the  same
      property.
        (C)  (i)  If  expenditures in respect to an industrial waste treatment
      facility or an air pollution control  facility  have  been  deducted  as
      provided herein and if within ten years from the end of the taxable year
      in which such deduction was allowed such property or any part thereof is
      used  for the primary purpose of salvaging materials which are usable in
      the manufacturing process or are marketable, the taxpayer  shall  report
      such change of use in its return for the first taxable year during which
      it occurs, and the commissioner of finance may recompute the tax for the
      year  or years for which such deduction was allowed and any carryback or
      carryover year, and may assess any additional tax  resulting  from  such
      recomputation  within  the  time fixed by paragraph eight of subdivision
      (c) of section 11-523 of this chapter.
        (ii) If a deduction is allowed as  herein  provided  for  expenditures
      paid  or  incurred  during  any taxable year on the basis of a temporary
      certificate of compliance issued pursuant to the public health law,  and
      if  the  taxpayer  fails to obtain a permanent certificate of compliance
      upon completion of the facilities with respect to which  such  temporary
      certificate  was  issued,  the taxpayer shall report such failure in its
      report for the taxable year during which such facilities are  completed,
      and  the  commissioner  of finance may recompute the tax for the year or
      years for  which  such  deduction  was  allowed  and  any  carryback  or
      carryover  year,  and  may assess any additional tax resulting from such
      recomputation within the time fixed by paragraph  eight  of  subdivision
      (c) of section 11-523 of this chapter.
    
        (D)  In  any  taxable year when property is sold or otherwise disposed
      of, with respect to which a deduction has been allowed pursuant to  this
      subdivision,  such  deduction  shall be disregarded in computing gain or
      loss, and the gain or loss on the sale  or  other  disposition  of  such
      property  shall  be  the  gain  or loss allowable for federal income tax
      purposes for such taxable year.
        (10) In the case of  mines,  oil  and  gas  wells  and  other  natural
      deposits,  no  deduction  of  any  allowance  for  percentage  depletion
      pursuant to section six hundred thirteen or section six hundred thirteen
      A of the internal  revenue  code  of  nineteen  hundred  fifty-four,  as
      amended,  shall  be  allowed.  However,  an allowance for depletion with
      respect to such property shall be deductible in the amount  which  would
      be  allowable  under section six hundred eleven of such internal revenue
      code if such deduction were computed without reference to  such  section
      six  hundred  thirteen  or  section six hundred thirteen A of such code.
      With respect to the computation of depletion pursuant to  this  section,
      the  basis  for such computation for taxable years beginning in nineteen
      hundred seventy-two shall be the federal basis. For  subsequent  taxable
      years,  the  basis  of  such  computation  shall  be reduced only by the
      deduction for the allowance for depletion deductible  pursuant  to  this
      section. In any taxable year when any such property is sold or otherwise
      disposed of, with respect to which a deduction has been allowed pursuant
      to  this  subdivision,  the  gain  or  loss  thereon  entering  into the
      computation of federal taxable income shall be disregarded in  computing
      unincorporated  business  taxable  income and there shall be added to or
      subtracted from federal gross income, so modified, the gain or loss upon
      such sale or other disposition. In computing  such  gain  or  loss,  the
      basis  of  the property sold or disposed of shall be adjusted to reflect
      the deduction allowed with respect to such  property  pursuant  to  this
      subdivision.
        (11)  A  deduction  shall  be  allowed  for  that portion of wages and
      salaries paid or incurred for the taxable year for which a deduction  is
      not  allowed  pursuant to the provisions of section two hundred eighty C
      of the internal revenue code.
        (12) For taxable years beginning after December thirty-first, nineteen
      hundred eighty-one, except with respect to property which is a qualified
      mass commuting vehicle described in subparagraph (D) of paragraph  eight
      of  subsection  (f)  of  section one hundred sixty-eight of the internal
      revenue  code  (relating  to  qualified  mass  commuting  vehicles),   a
      deduction  shall be allowed for any amount which the taxpayer could have
      excluded for purposes of this chapter  had  it  not  made  the  election
      provided  for in such paragraph eight as it was in effect for agreements
      entered into prior to January first, nineteen hundred eighty-four.
        (13) For taxable years beginning after December thirty-first, nineteen
      hundred eighty-one, except with respect to property which is a qualified
      mass commuting vehicle described in subparagraph (D) of paragraph  eight
      of  subsection  (f)  of  section one hundred sixty-eight of the internal
      revenue  code  (relating  to  qualified  mass  commuting  vehicles),  no
      deduction  shall be allowed for any amount deductible for federal income
      tax purposes solely as a result of an  election  made  pursuant  to  the
      provisions  of  such  paragraph eight as it was in effect for agreements
      entered into prior to January first, nineteen hundred eighty-four.
        (14) In the case of  property  placed  in  service  in  taxable  years
      beginning   before  nineteen  hundred  ninety-four,  for  taxable  years
      beginning after  December  thirty-first,  nineteen  hundred  eighty-one,
      except with respect to property subject to the provisions of section two
      hundred  eighty-F  of  the internal revenue code and property subject to
      the provisions of  section  one  hundred  sixty-eight  of  the  internal
    
      revenue  code  which is placed in service in this state in taxable years
      beginning after December thirty-first, nineteen hundred eighty-four,  no
      deduction  shall  be  allowed  for  the  amount allowable as a deduction
      determined under section one hundred sixty-eight of the internal revenue
      code.
        (15)  In  the  case  of  property  placed  in service in taxable years
      beginning  before  nineteen  hundred  ninety-four,  for  taxable   years
      beginning  after  December  thirty-first,  nineteen  hundred eighty-one,
      except with respect to property subject to the provisions of section two
      hundred eighty-F of the internal revenue code and  property  subject  to
      the  provisions  of  section  one  hundred  sixty-eight  of the internal
      revenue code which is placed in service in this state in  taxable  years
      beginning after December thirty-first, nineteen hundred eighty-four, and
      provided  a  deduction  has  not been disallowed pursuant to subdivision
      thirteen of this section, a taxpayer shall be allowed  with  respect  to
      property  which  is  subject  to  the  provisions of section one hundred
      sixty-eight of the internal  revenue  code  the  depreciation  deduction
      allowable  under section one hundred sixty-seven of the internal revenue
      code as such section would have applied to property placed in service on
      December thirty-first, nineteen hundred eighty.
        (16) Notwithstanding any  other  provision  of  this  chapter  to  the
      contrary,  no  deduction  shall be allowed for interest, depreciation or
      any other expense directly or indirectly attributable  to  the  holding,
      leasing  or managing of real property or to income or gain therefrom if,
      and to the extent that,  such  holding,  leasing  or  managing  of  real
      property  is  not  deemed  an  unincorporated business carried on by the
      taxpayer pursuant to the provisions of subdivision (d) of section 11-502
      of this chapter.
        (17) Notwithstanding any  other  provision  of  this  chapter  to  the
      contrary,  no  deduction  shall  be allowed for any expenses directly or
      indirectly attributable to activities  described  in  paragraph  two  of
      subdivision  (c) of section 11-502 of this chapter if, and to the extent
      that, such activities are not deemed an unincorporated business  carried
      on  by  the  taxpayer  pursuant  to the provisions of subdivision (c) of
      section 11-502 of this chapter.
        (18) Notwithstanding any  other  provision  of  this  chapter  to  the
      contrary,  in  the  case  of a taxpayer that is an unincorporated entity
      described in subparagraph (B) of paragraph four of  subdivision  (c)  of
      section  11-502  of  this chapter, no deduction shall be allowed for any
      losses or expenses directly or indirectly attributable to  the  sale  or
      other  disposition  of  an interest in another unincorporated entity if,
      and to the extent that, such losses  or  expenses  are  attributable  to
      activities   of   such   other   unincorporated  entity  not  deemed  an
      unincorporated business carried on  by  the  taxpayer  pursuant  to  the
      provisions of subdivision (c) of section 11-502 of this chapter.
        (19)  Notwithstanding  any  other  provision  of  this  chapter to the
      contrary, no deduction shall be allowed for  interest,  depreciation  or
      any  other  expense directly or indirectly attributable to the provision
      by an owner, lessee or  fiduciary  holding,  leasing  or  managing  real
      property  of  the  service  of  parking,  garaging  or  storing of motor
      vehicles on a monthly or longer term  basis  to  tenants  at  such  real
      property  if,  and to the extent that, the provision of such services to
      such tenants is not deemed an unincorporated business  pursuant  to  the
      provisions of subdivision (d) of section 11-502 of this chapter.
        (20) For taxable years ending after September tenth, two thousand one,
      in  the  case  of  qualified  property  described  in  paragraph  two of
      subsection k of section one hundred sixty-eight of the internal  revenue

      internal revenue code  as  such  section  would  have  applied  to  such
      property  had  it  been acquired by the taxpayer on September tenth, two
      thousand one, provided, however, that for taxable years beginning on  or
      after January first, two thousand four, in the case of a passenger motor
      vehicle  or  a  sport  utility  vehicle  subject  to  the  provisions of
      subdivision twenty-four of this section, the limitation under clause (i)
      of subparagraph (A) of paragraph one of subdivision (a) of  section  two

      the  date  such  vehicle  was  placed in service and not as of September
      tenth, two thousand one.
        (22) For purposes  of  subdivisions  twenty  and  twenty-one  of  this
      section,   qualified  resurgence  zone  property  shall  mean  qualified
      property described in paragraph two  of  subsection  k  of  section  one
      hundred  sixty-eight  of  the internal revenue code substantially all of

Section 11-508
--------------

Section 11-508 ::    
        
     
        ยง  11-508  Allocation to the city. (a) General; allocation of business
      income. If an unincorporated business is  carried  on  both  within  and
      without the city, as determined under regulations of the commissioner of
      finance, there shall be allocated to the city, in the manner provided in
      subdivision  (b),  (c)  or  (d)  of  this  section, a fair and equitable
      portion of its business income. For taxable years beginning before  July
      first,  nineteen  hundred ninety-six, if the unincorporated business has
      no regular place of business outside the  city,  all  of  such  business
      income shall be allocated to the city.
        (b)  (1)  Allocation  by taxpayer's books. For taxable years beginning
      before January first, two thousand five, the portion  allocable  to  the
      city  may  be  determined  from the books of the business if the methods
      used in keeping such books are approved by the commissioner  of  finance
      as fairly and equitably reflecting the income from the city.
        (2)(i)  If  a taxpayer determines the portion of business income to be
      allocated to the city using the method prescribed in  paragraph  one  of
      this  subdivision on a timely filed original return with respect to each
      of the two taxable years, each of which must consist of  twelve  months,
      immediately  preceding the taxpayer's first taxable year beginning on or
      after January first, two thousand five, the taxpayer may make a one-time
      election to continue to use that method for taxable years  beginning  on
      or  after January first, two thousand five and before January first, two
      thousand twelve. Such  election  shall  be  made  by  using  the  method
      prescribed  in  paragraph  one of this subdivision on an original timely
      filed return with respect to the first  taxable  year  beginning  on  or
      after  January  first,  two  thousand five and before January first, two
      thousand six. Such election may not be made, or if made, shall be deemed
      revoked as of the beginning of the taxable year if, for  either  of  the
      two  taxable  years immediately preceding the year in which the election
      is made, the commissioner of finance has determined the methods used  in
      keeping  such  books do not fairly and equitably reflect the income from
      the city.
        (ii) (A) A taxpayer  that  has  made  the  election  provided  for  in
      subparagraph  (i)  of this paragraph may revoke it by filing an original
      or amended return using an allocation method permitted by  this  section
      other  than  the  method prescribed in paragraph one of this subdivision
      unless the commissioner of finance has determined that such method  does
      not fairly and equitably reflect the income from the city.
        (B)  The  election  provided for in subparagraph (i) of this paragraph
      shall be deemed to have been revoked as of the beginning of the  taxable
      year  if,  for any taxable year during which the election is intended to
      be in effect, the  commissioner  of  finance  has  determined  that  the
      methods used in keeping the taxpayer's books do not fairly and equitably
      reflect the income from the city.
        (C)  In  the  case  of  a  taxpayer  that  is  a  partnership or other
      unincorporated entity, the election provided for in subparagraph (i)  of
      this  paragraph shall be deemed to have been revoked as of the beginning
      of the taxable  year  unless  one  or  more  of  the  persons  having  a
      proportionate  interest  or  interests,  amounting  to  more  than fifty
      percent of all such interests, in the taxpayer's unincorporated business
      gross income and unincorporated business  deductions  for  such  taxable
      year   were  persons  having  a  proportionate  interest  or  interests,
      amounting to more than fifty percent  of  all  such  interests,  in  the
      taxpayer's  unincorporated  business  gross  income  and  unincorporated
      business deductions at the end  of  the  taxpayer's  last  taxable  year
      beginning  before January first, two thousand five. For purposes of this
      clause, a transfer of an ownership interest in  unincorporated  business
      gross  income  or unincorporated business deductions upon the death of a
    
      partner or owner to such deceased partner's or owner's estate  shall  be
      disregarded  but  transfers  by  such  decedent's  estate  shall  not be
      disregarded.
        (D)  Once  the  election  provided  for  in  subparagraph  (i) of this
      paragraph has been revoked by the taxpayer pursuant  to  clause  (A)  or
      deemed  revoked pursuant to clauses (B) or (C) of this subparagraph, the
      taxpayer shall be barred from using the method prescribed  in  paragraph
      one  of  this subdivision for the taxable year in which the election has
      been revoked or deemed revoked and any subsequent taxable year.
        (c) Allocation by formula. If subdivision (b) does not  apply  to  the
      taxpayer,  the  portion  allocable  to  the  city shall be determined by
      multiplying (A)  the  business  income  by  (B)  a  business  allocation
      percentage  to be determined by adding together the percentages computed
      under paragraphs one, two and three of this  subdivision,  and  dividing
      the  result  by  the  number of percentages; provided, however, that for
      taxable years  beginning  on  or  after  July  first,  nineteen  hundred
      ninety-six, a taxpayer that is a "manufacturing business," as defined in
      subdivision  (g)  of this section, may determine its business allocation
      percentage as provided in such subdivision (g):
        (1) Property percentage. The percentage computed by dividing  (A)  the
      average  of  the value, at the beginning and end of the taxable year, of
      real and tangible personal property connected  with  the  unincorporated
      business  and  located within the city, by (B) the average of the value,
      at the beginning and end of the taxable year, of all real  and  tangible
      personal property connected with the unincorporated business and located
      both  within  and  without the city. For this purpose, for taxable years
      beginning before January first, two thousand five, real  property  shall
      include  real  property  rented  to the unincorporated business and, for
      this purpose, for taxable years beginning on and  after  January  first,
      two  thousand  five,  real  and tangible personal property shall include
      real  and  tangible  personal  property  rented  to  the  unincorporated
      business  and  the  value  of  such  real and tangible personal property
      rented to the unincorporated business shall  mean  the  product  of  (i)
      eight  and  (ii) the gross rents payable for the rental of such property
      during the taxable year.
        (2) Payroll percentage. The percentage computed by  dividing  (A)  the
      total  wages,  salaries  and other personal service compensation paid or
      incurred during the taxable year to employees  in  connection  with  the
      unincorporated  business carried on within the city, by (B) the total of
      all wages, salaries and other  personal  service  compensation  paid  or
      incurred  during  the  taxable  year to employees in connection with the
      unincorporated business carried on both within and without the city.
        (3) Gross income percentage. The percentage computed by  dividing  (A)
      the  gross  sales  or  charges  for  services performed by or through an
      agency located within the city, by (B) the total of all gross  sales  or
      charges for services performed within and without the city. The sales or
      charges  to  be allocated to the city shall include all sales negotiated
      or consummated, and charges for  services  performed,  by  an  employee,
      agent,  agency  or independent contractor chiefly situated at, connected
      by contract or  otherwise  with,  or  sent  out  from,  offices  of  the
      unincorporated  business,  or  other agencies, situated within the city;
      provided, however, that for taxable years beginning  on  or  after  July
      first,  nineteen hundred ninety-six, sales of tangible personal property
      shall not be allocated to the city  as  hereinabove  in  this  paragraph
      provided,  but  shall  be allocated to the city only where shipments are
      made to points within the city, and provided, further, that:
        (A) for taxable years beginning on or after July first,  two  thousand
      five,   for  taxpayers  having  gross  receipts  for  the  taxable  year
    
      (determined without regard to any deductions) of less than  one  hundred
      thousand  dollars,  charges for services performed shall be allocated to
      the city to the extent that the services are performed within the city;
        (B)  for  taxable years beginning on or after July first, two thousand
      six,  for  taxpayers  having  gross  receipts  for  the   taxable   year
      (determined without regard to any deductions) of less than three hundred
      thousand  dollars,  charges for services performed shall be allocated to
      the city to the extent that the services are performed within the  city;
      and
        (C)  for  taxable years beginning on or after July first, two thousand
      seven, for all other taxpayers, charges for services performed shall  be
      allocated  to  the  city  to  the extent that the services are performed
      within the city.
        (d) Other allocation methods. The portion allocable to the city  shall
      be   determined   in  accordance  with  rules  and  regulations  of  the
      commissioner of finance if  it  shall  appear  to  the  commissioner  of
      finance  that  the  income  from  the  city  is not fairly and equitably
      reflected under the provisions of either subdivision (b) or  subdivision
      (c) of this section.
        (e)  Special  rules  for  real  estate. Income and deductions from the
      rental of real property, and gain and loss from the  sale,  exchange  or
      other  disposition  of real property, shall not be subject to allocation
      under subdivision (b), (c),  or  (d)  of  this  section,  but  shall  be
      considered  as  entirely derived from or connected with the state, other
      than this state, in which such property is located or, if such  property
      is  located  in  this  state,  the political subdivision thereof. To the
      extent that anything in the preceding sentence is inconsistent with  any
      provision  of  subdivision  (d)  of  section  11-502, subdivision (c) of
      section 11-506 or subdivision sixteen of section 11-507 of this chapter,
      the provisions of such  subdivisions  shall  take  precedence  over  the
      provisions of the preceding sentence.
        (e-1)   Special   rules   for   publishers   and   broadcasters.   (1)
      Notwithstanding anything in paragraph three of subdivision (c)  of  this
      section to the contrary and except as provided in paragraph four of this
      subdivision,  in  the  case  of  a  taxpayer  engaged in the business of
      publishing newspapers or periodicals, there shall be  allocated  to  the
      city,  for  purposes of such paragraph three, the gross sales or charges
      for services arising from sales of  subscriptions  to,  and  advertising
      contained  in,  such  newspapers or periodicals, to the extent that such
      newspapers or periodicals are delivered to points within the city.
        (2) Notwithstanding anything in paragraph three of subdivision (c)  of
      this section to the contrary and except as provided in paragraph four of
      this  subdivision,  in the case of a taxpayer engaged in the business of
      broadcasting radio or television programs, whether  through  the  public
      airwaves  or by cable, direct or indirect satellite transmission, or any
      other means of transmission, there shall be allocated to the  city,  for
      purposes  of  such  paragraph  three,  a  portion  of the gross sales or
      charges for services arising from the  sale  of  subscriptions  to  such
      programs  or  from  the  broadcasting of such programs and of commercial
      messages  in  connection  therewith,  such  portion  to  be   determined
      according  to  the number of listeners or viewers within and without the
      city.
        (3) Notwithstanding anything in this section (other  than  subdivision
      (e)  of this section) to the contrary, in the case of a taxpayer that is
      substantially engaged, in the  aggregate,  in  any  combination  of  the
      businesses  referred  to  in  paragraphs  one,  two  and  four  of  this
      subdivision, the portion of business income allocable to the city  shall
      be  determined  in  accordance with the provisions of subdivision (c) of
    
      this section (as modified by  paragraphs  one,  two  and  four  of  this
      subdivision),  unless  the  commissioner  of finance determines that the
      business income from the city is  not  fairly  and  equitably  reflected
      under  the  provisions  of  such  subdivision  (c),  in  which event the
      provisions of subdivision (d) of this section shall apply in determining
      the portion of business income allocable to the city and the  provisions
      of subdivision (b) of this section shall not apply. For purposes of this
      subdivision, a taxpayer shall be deemed to be substantially engaged in a
      business  or  businesses  referred  to in such paragraphs one and two if
      more than ten percent of the taxpayer's gross receipts for  the  taxable
      year are attributable to such business or businesses.
        (4)   Notwithstanding  anything  in  paragraph  one  or  two  of  this
      subdivision to the contrary, for taxable years  beginning  on  or  after
      January  first,  two  thousand two, in the case of a taxpayer engaged in
      the business of publishing newspapers or  periodicals,  or  broadcasting
      radio  or television programs, whether through the public airwaves or by
      cable, direct or indirect satellite transmission, or any other means  of
      transmission,  there  shall  be  allocated  to the city, for purposes of
      paragraph three of subdivision (c) of this section, the gross  sales  or
      charges  to  subscribers  located  in the city for subscriptions to such
      newspapers, periodicals, or  program  services.  For  purposes  of  this
      paragraph,  a  subscriber shall be deemed located in the city if, in the
      case  of  newspapers  and  periodicals,  the  mailing  address  for  the
      subscription  is  within  the city and, in the case of program services,
      the billing address  for  the  subscription  is  within  the  city.  For
      purposes of this clause, "subscriber" shall mean a member of the general
      public who receives such newspapers, periodicals or program services and
      does not further distribute them.
        (e-2)   Rules   for  receipts  from  certain  services  to  investment
      companies.  (1) For taxable years beginning on or after  January  first,
      two  thousand one, for purposes of paragraph three of subdivision (c) of
      this section, the  portion  of  receipts  received  from  an  investment
      company   arising   from  the  sale  of  management,  administration  or
      distribution  services  to  such  investment   company   determined   in
      accordance  with  paragraph  two  of this subdivision shall be deemed to
      arise from services performed within the city (such portion referred  to
      herein as the New York city portion).
        (2)  The  New  York  city portion shall be the product of the total of
      such receipts from the  sale  of  such  services  and  a  fraction.  The
      numerator  of  that  fraction  is the sum of the monthly percentages (as
      defined  hereinafter)  determined  for  each  month  of  the  investment
      company's  taxable  year  for  federal income tax purposes which taxable
      year ends within the taxable year of the  taxpayer  (but  excluding  any
      month  during  which  the investment company had no outstanding shares).
      The monthly percentage for each such month is determined by dividing the
      number of shares in the investment company which are owned on  the  last
      day  of  the month by shareholders that are domiciled in the city by the
      total number of shares in the investment  company  outstanding  on  that
      date.  The  denominator  of  the  fraction is the number of such monthly
      percentages.
        (3)(A) For purposes of this subdivision the term  "domicile",  in  the
      case  of  an  individual  shall  have  the  meaning ascribed to it under
      chapter seventeen of this title; an estate or trust is domiciled in  the
      city  if  it  is a city resident estate or trust as defined in paragraph
      three of subdivision (b) of section 11-1705 of  this  code;  a  business
      entity  is  domiciled  in the city if the location of the actual seat of
      management or control is in the city. It  shall  be  presumed  that  the
      domicile of a shareholder, with respect to any month, is his, her or its
    
      mailing  address on the records of the investment company as of the last
      day of such month.
        (B)  For  purposes  of this subdivision, the term "investment company"
      means a regulated investment company, as defined in section 851  of  the
      internal revenue code, and a partnership to which section 7704(a) of the
      internal  revenue  code applies (by virtue of section 7704(c)(3) of such
      code) and that meets the requirements of section 851(b)  of  such  code.
      The  preceding sentence shall be applied to the taxable year for federal
      income  tax  purposes  of  the  business  entity  that  is  asserted  to
      constitute  an  investment  company that ends within the taxable year of
      the taxpayer.
        (C) For purposes of this  subdivision,  the  term  "receipts  from  an
      investment   company"   includes   amounts  received  directly  from  an
      investment company as well as amounts received from the shareholders  in
      such investment company in their capacity as such.
        (D)  For  purposes of this subdivision, the term "management services"
      means the rendering of  investment  advice  to  an  investment  company,
      making  determinations  as to when sales and purchases of securities are
      to be made on behalf  of  an  investment  company,  or  the  selling  or
      purchasing  of  securities constituting assets of an investment company,
      and related activities, but only where such activity or  activities  are
      performed  pursuant  to  a  contract with the investment company entered
      into pursuant to section 15(a) of the federal investment company act  of
      nineteen hundred forty, as amended.
        (E) For purposes of this subdivision, the term "distribution services"
      means   the   services   of  advertising,  servicing  investor  accounts
      (including redemptions),  marketing  shares  or  selling  shares  of  an
      investment  company, but, in the case of advertising, servicing investor
      accounts (including redemptions) or marketing shares,  only  where  such
      service is performed by a person who is (or was, in the case of a closed
      end  company) also engaged in the service of selling such shares. In the
      case of an open end company, such service  of  selling  shares  must  be
      performed  pursuant to a contract entered into pursuant to section 15(b)
      of the federal investment company act  of  nineteen  hundred  forty,  as
      amended.
        (F)  For  purposes  of  this  subdivision,  the  term  "administration
      services" includes clerical, accounting, bookkeeping,  data  processing,
      internal  auditing,  legal  and tax services performed for an investment
      company but only if the provider of such service or services during  the
      taxable  year  in  which  such  service  or services are sold also sells
      management or distribution services, as  defined  hereinabove,  to  such
      investment company.
        (e-3)   Rules  for  receipts  for  services  performed  by  registered
      securities or commodities brokers or dealers.
        (1) For taxable years beginning after two thousand eight, in the  case
      of  a taxpayer which is a registered securities or commodities broker or
      dealer, for purposes of paragraph  three  of  subdivision  (c)  of  this
      section, the receipts specified in subparagraphs (A) through (G) of this
      paragraph  shall  be  deemed to arise from services performed within the
      city to the extent set forth in such subparagraphs.
        (A) Receipts  constituting  brokerage  commissions  derived  from  the
      execution  of securities or commodities purchase or sales orders for the
      accounts of customers shall be deemed to arise from  services  performed
      at  the  mailing  address in the records of the taxpayer of the customer
      who is responsible for paying such commissions.
        (B)  Receipts  constituting  margin  interest  earned  on  behalf   of
      brokerage  accounts  shall be deemed to arise from services performed at
    
      the mailing address in the records of the taxpayer of the  customer  who
      is responsible for paying such margin interest.
        (C)  Gross  income,  including any accrued interest or dividends, from
      principal transactions for  the  purchase  or  sale  of  stocks,  bonds,
      foreign  exchange and other securities or commodities (including futures
      and  forward  contracts,  options  and  other  types  of  securities  or
      commodities  derivatives  contracts)  shall  be  deemed  to  arise  from
      services performed within  the  city  either  (i)  to  the  extent  that
      production  credits are awarded to branches, offices or employees of the
      taxpayer within the city as a result of such principal  transactions  or
      (ii)  if  the  taxpayer so elects, to the extent that the gross proceeds
      from such principal transactions (determined without deduction  for  any
      cost  incurred by the taxpayer to acquire the securities or commodities)
      are generated from sales  of  securities  or  commodities  to  customers
      within  the  city  based upon the mailing addresses of such customers in
      the records of the  taxpayer.  For  purposes  of  clause  (ii)  of  this
      subparagraph,  the taxpayer shall separately calculate such gross income
      from principal transactions  by  type  of  security  or  commodity.  For
      purposes  of this subparagraph, gross income from principal transactions
      shall be determined after the deduction of  any  cost  incurred  by  the
      taxpayer  to acquire the securities or commodities. For purposes of this
      subdivision,  the  term  "production  credits"  means  credits   granted
      pursuant  to  the  internal  accounting  system  used by the taxpayer to
      measure the amount of revenue that should be  awarded  to  a  particular
      branch or office or employee of the taxpayer which is based, at least in
      part,  on  the  branch's,  the  office's  or  the  employee's particular
      activities. Upon request, the taxpayer shall be required  to  furnish  a
      detailed   explanation   of  such  internal  accounting  system  to  the
      department.
        (D) (i) Receipts constituting fees earned by the taxpayer for advisory
      services to a customer in connection with the underwriting of securities
      for such customer (such customer being the entity which is contemplating
      issuing or is issuing securities) or fees earned  by  the  taxpayer  for
      managing  an  underwriting  shall  be  deemed  to  arise  from  services
      performed at the mailing address in the records of the taxpayer of  such
      customer who is responsible for paying such fees.
        (ii)  Receipts  constituting  the primary spread or selling concession
      from underwritten securities shall be  deemed  to  arise  from  services
      performed  within  the  city  to  the extent that production credits are
      awarded to branches, offices or employees of  the  taxpayer  within  the
      city as a result of the sale of the underwritten securities.
        (iii) The term "primary spread" means the difference between the price
      paid  by the taxpayer to the issuer of the securities being marketed and
      the  price  received  from  the  subsequent  sale  of  the  underwritten
      securities  at  the  initial  public  offering  price,  less any selling
      concession and any fees paid to the taxpayer for  advisory  services  or
      any  manager's  fees,  if  such fees are not paid by the customer to the
      taxpayer separately. The term "public offering price"  means  the  price
      agreed  upon  by the taxpayer and the issuer at which the securities are
      to be offered to the public. The term  "selling  concession"  means  the
      amount  paid  to the taxpayer for participating in the underwriting of a
      security where the taxpayer is not the lead underwriter.
        (E) Receipts constituting interest earned by the taxpayer on loans and
      advances made by the taxpayer to an entity affiliated with the  taxpayer
      shall  be deemed to arise from services performed at the principal place
      of  business  of  such  affiliated  entity.   For   purposes   of   this
      subparagraph, an entity shall be considered affiliated with the taxpayer
    
      if  such  entity  and  the  taxpayer  have eighty percent or more common
      direct or indirect, actual or beneficial ownership.
        (F)  Receipts constituting account maintenance fees shall be deemed to
      arise from services performed at the mailing address in the  records  of
      the  taxpayer of the customer who is responsible for paying such account
      maintenance fees.
        (G) Receipts constituting fees for management  or  advisory  services,
      including   fees   for  advisory  services  in  relation  to  merger  or
      acquisition activities, but excluding fees paid for  services  described
      in  paragraph  one of subdivision (e-2) of this section, shall be deemed
      to arise from services performed at the mailing address in  the  records
      of the taxpayer of the customer who is responsible for paying such fees.
        (2) For purposes of this subdivision, the term "securities" shall have
      the  same  meaning  as in section 475(c)(2) of the internal revenue code
      and the term "commodities" shall have the same  meaning  as  in  section
      475(e)(2)  of  such code. The term "registered securities or commodities
      broker or dealer" means a broker or dealer registered  as  such  by  the
      securities  and  exchange  commission or the commodities futures trading
      commission, and shall include an OTC derivatives dealer as defined under
      regulations of the securities and exchange commission at title 17,  part
      240,   section  3b-12  of  the  code  of  federal  regulations  (17  CFR
      240.3b-12).
        (3) If the  taxpayer  receives  any  of  the  receipts  enumerated  in
      paragraph   (1)  of  this  subdivision  as  a  result  of  a  securities
      correspondent relationship such taxpayer  has  with  another  registered
      securities  or  commodities broker or dealer with the taxpayer acting in
      this relationship as the clearing firm, such receipts shall be deemed to
      arise from services performed within the city to the extent set forth in
      each of the subparagraphs in paragraph  (1)  of  this  subdivision.  The
      amount  of  such  receipts  shall  exclude  the  amount  the taxpayer is
      required to  pay  to  the  correspondent  firm  for  such  correspondent
      relationship. If the taxpayer receives any of the receipts enumerated in
      paragraph   (1)  of  this  subdivision  as  a  result  of  a  securities
      correspondent relationship such taxpayer  has  with  another  registered
      securities  or  commodities broker or dealer with the taxpayer acting in
      this relationship as the introducing firm, such receipts shall be deemed
      to arise from services performed within the city to the extent set forth
      in each of the subparagraphs in paragraph (1) of this subdivision.
        (4) If, for  purposes  of  subparagraph  (A),  (B),  (F),  or  (G)  of
      paragraph (1) of this subdivision, and clause (i) of subparagraph (C) of
      paragraph  (1)  of  this  subdivision,  the  taxpayer is unable from its
      records to determine the mailing address of the customer,  the  receipts
      described  in  any of such subparagraphs and such clause shall be deemed
      to arise from services performed at the branch or office of the taxpayer
      that generates the transaction for  the  customer  that  generated  such
      receipts.
        (f)  Allocation  of investment income. (1) The investment income of an
      unincorporated business shall be allocated to the  city  by  multiplying
      such  investment  income  by  an  investment allocation percentage to be
      determined as follows:
        (A) multiply the amount of its investment  capital  invested  in  each
      stock,  bond  or  other  security  (other  than governmental securities)
      during the period covered by  its  return  by  the  issuer's  allocation
      percentage (determined as provided in paragraph two of this subdivision)
      of the issuer or obligor thereof:
        (B) add together the products so obtained; and
        (C)  divide the sum so obtained by the total of its investment capital
      invested during such period in stocks, bonds and other securities;
    
      provided, however, that in case any investment capital  is  invested  in
      any  stock,  bond  or other security during only a portion of the period
      covered by the return, only such portion of such capital shall be  taken
      into  account;  and  provided,  further, that if a taxpayer's investment
      allocation  percentage is zero, interest received on bank accounts shall
      be allocated in the manner provided in subdivision (b), (c)  or  (d)  of
      this section.
        (2)  (A)  In  the  case  of  an issuer or obligor subject to tax under
      subchapter two of chapter six of this title, or  subject  to  tax  as  a
      utility  corporation  under  chapter  eleven of this title, the issuer's
      allocation percentage shall be the percentage of the appropriate measure
      (as defined hereinafter) which is required to be  allocated  within  the
      city on the report or reports, if any, required of the issuer or obligor
      under  chapter  six  or eleven of this title for the preceding year. The
      appropriate measure referred to in the preceding sentence shall  be:  in
      the  case  of  an issuer or obligor subject to subchapter two of chapter
      six of this title, entire capital; and in  the  case  of  an  issuer  or
      obligor   subject   to  chapter  eleven  of  this  title  as  a  utility
      corporation, gross income.
        (B) In the case of an issuer or obligor subject to tax under part four
      of  subchapter  three  of  chapter  six  of  this  title,  the  issuer's
      allocation percentage shall be determined as follows:
        (i)  In  the case of a banking corporation described in paragraphs one
      through eight of subdivision (a) of section 11-640 of this  title  which
      is  organized  under  the  laws  of the United States, this state or any
      other state of the United States,  the  issuer's  allocation  percentage
      shall  be  its  alternative  entire net income allocation percentage, as
      defined in subdivision (c) of section 11-642  of  this  title,  for  the
      preceding  year.  In  the  case  of  such  a  banking  corporation whose
      alternative  entire  net  income  for  the  preceding  year  is  derived
      exclusively  from  business  carried  on  within  the city, its issuer's
      allocation percentage shall be one hundred percent.
        (ii) In the case of a banking corporation described in  paragraph  two
      of  subdivision  (a)  of section 11-640 of this title which is organized
      under the laws of a country other than the United States,  the  issuer's
      allocation  percentage  shall  be  determined by dividing (I) the amount
      described in  clause  (i)  of  subparagraph  (A)  of  paragraph  two  of
      subdivision  (a)  of  section  11-642 of this title with respect to such
      issuer or obligor for the preceding year, by (II) the  gross  income  of
      such  issuer  or  obligor from all sources within and without the United
      States, for such preceding year, whether or not included in  alternative
      entire net income for such year.
        (iii)  In the case of an issuer or obligor described in paragraph nine
      of subdivision (a) or in paragraph two of  subdivision  (d)  of  section
      11-640  of  this  title,  the  issuer's  allocation  percentage shall be
      determined by dividing the portion of the entire capital of  the  issuer
      or  obligor  allocable  to the city for the preceding year by the entire
      capital, wherever located, of the issuer or obligor  for  the  preceding
      year.
        (C)  Provided,  however, that if a report or reports for the preceding
      year are not filed, or if filed do not contain information  which  would
      permit  the  determination  of such issuer's allocation percentage, then
      the issuer's allocation percentage to be used shall, at  the  discretion
      of  the  commissioner  of finance, be either (i) the issuer's allocation
      percentage derived from the most recently filed report or reports of the
      issuer or obligor or (ii) a percentage calculated, by  the  commissioner
      of  finance,  reasonably  to indicate the degree of economic presence in
      the city of the issuer or obligor during the preceding year.
    
        (3) For purposes of this  subdivision,  investment  capital  shall  be
      determined  by  taking  the  average  value of the gross assets included
      therein  (less  liabilities  deductible  therefrom   pursuant   to   the
      provisions  of  subdivision  (h) of section 11-501 of this chapter). The
      value  of  investment  capital  which  consists of marketable securities
      shall be the fair market value  thereof  and  the  value  of  investment
      capital  other  than  marketable  securities  shall be the value thereof
      shown on the  books  and  records  of  the  unincorporated  business  in
      accordance with generally accepted accounting principles.
        (g) Special rules for manufacturing businesses.  (1) For taxable years
      beginning on or after July first, nineteen hundred ninety-six and before
      January  first,  two thousand eleven, a manufacturing business may elect
      to determine its business allocation percentage by adding  together  the
      percentages   determined   under   paragraphs  one,  two  and  three  of
      subdivision (c) of this section and an additional  percentage  equal  to
      the  percentage  determined  under paragraph three of subdivision (c) of
      this section, and dividing the result by the number  of  percentages  so
      added together.
        (2)  An election under this subdivision must be made on a timely filed
      (determined with regard to extensions granted) original return  for  the
      taxable  year.  Once  made  for  a  taxable year, such election shall be
      irrevocable for that taxable year. A separate election must be made  for
      each  taxable  year. A manufacturing business that has failed to make an
      election as provided in this paragraph shall be  required  to  determine
      its  business  allocation percentage without regard to the provisions of
      this subdivision. Notwithstanding anything  in  this  paragraph  to  the
      contrary,  the  commissioner  of  finance  may  permit  a  manufacturing
      business to make or revoke an election under this subdivision, upon such
      terms and conditions  as  the  commissioner  may  prescribe,  where  the
      commissioner  determines  that  such permission should be granted in the
      interests of fairness and  equity  due  to  a  change  in  circumstances
      resulting from an audit adjustment.
        (3)  As  used  in  this subdivision, the term "manufacturing business"
      means an unincorporated business primarily engaged in the  manufacturing
      and   sale   thereof   of  tangible  personal  property;  and  the  term
      "manufacturing" includes the process (including  the  assembly  process)
      (i)  of  working raw materials into wares suitable for use or (ii) which
      gives new shapes, new qualities or  new  combinations  to  matter  which
      already  has  gone  through  some  artificial  process,  by  the  use of
      machinery,  tools,  appliances   and   other   similar   equipment.   An
      unincorporated  business  shall be deemed to be primarily engaged in the
      activities described in  the  preceding  sentence  if  more  than  fifty
      percent  of  its gross receipts for the taxable year are attributable to
      such activities.
        (h) Notwithstanding subdivision (d)  of  this  section,  if  it  shall
      appear  to  the  commissioner of finance that any business or investment
      allocation  percentage  determined  as  hereinabove  provided  does  not
      properly  reflect the activity, business, or income of a taxpayer within
      the city, the commissioner of finance shall be authorized in his or  her
      discretion,  in  the case of a business allocation percentage, to adjust
      it by (1) excluding one or more of the factors  therein;  (2)  including
      one or more factors, such as expenses, purchases, contract values (minus
      subcontract  values); (3) excluding one or more assets in computing such
      allocation percentage, provided the income therefrom is also excluded in
      determining unincorporated business entire net income, or (4) any  other
      similar  or  different  method  calculated  to  effect a fair and proper
      allocation of the income reasonably attributable to the city, and in the
      case of an investment allocation percentage, to adjust it  by  excluding
    
      one  or  more  assets  in computing such percentage; provided the income
      therefrom is also excluded in determining unincorporated business entire
      net income. The commissioner of finance from time to time shall  publish
      all  rulings  of general public interest with respect to any application
      of the provisions of this subdivision.
        (i) Notwithstanding subdivision (c) of this section,  but  subject  to
      subdivision  (g)  of  this  section,  the business allocation percentage
      shall be computed in the manner set forth in this subdivision.
        (1) For taxable years beginning in two  thousand  nine,  the  business

Section 11-509 ::    
        
     
        ยง  11-509  Deductions  not  subject  to  allocation.  (a) In computing
      unincorporated business taxable income, there shall be allowed  (without
      allocation   under  section  11-508  of  this  chapter)  deductions  for
      reasonable compensation  for  taxable  years  beginning  before  January
      first,  two  thousand seven, not in excess of five thousand dollars, and
      for taxable years beginning on or  after  January  first,  two  thousand
      seven,  not  in excess of ten thousand dollars, for personal services of
      the proprietor and each partner actively engaged in  the  unincorporated
      business,  but  the aggregate of such deductions shall not exceed twenty
      per centum  of  the  unincorporated  business  taxable  income  computed
      without  the  benefit  of  any  deductions under this subdivision or the
      unincorporated business exemptions under section 11-510 of this chapter.
        (b) Subject to the conditions provided in paragraphs three and four of
      this subdivision at the election of the taxpayer  there  shall  also  be
      allowed (without allocation under section 11-508 of this chapter) either
      or  both  of  the  items  set  forth  in  paragraphs one and two of this
      subdivision, except that only one of the items  shall  be  allowed  with
      respect to any one item of property.
        (1)  Depreciation  with  respect  to any property such as described in
      paragraphs three or  four  of  this  subdivision,  and  subject  to  the
      conditions  provided  therein,  not  exceeding  twice  the  depreciation
      allowed with respect  to  the  same  property  for  federal  income  tax
      purposes.  Such  deduction  shall be allowed only upon condition that no
      deduction shall be allowed pursuant to section 11-507  of  this  chapter
      for  depreciation  of the same property, and the total of all deductions
      allowed pursuant to this paragraph in any taxable  year  or  years  with
      respect to any property shall not exceed its cost or other basis and, in
      the  case  of  an  unincorporated  business  carried  on both within and
      without this city, with respect to property described in paragraph  four
      of this subdivision, such total shall not exceed its cost or other basis
      multiplied  by  (A)  the  percentage  of  the  excess  of the taxpayer's
      unincorporated business gross income over  its  unincorporated  business
      deductions  allocated  to  this  city,  or  (B)  the  percentage  of the
      taxpayer's  business  income  allocated  to  this  city,  whichever   is
      applicable, which percentage shall be determined under section 11-508 of
      this chapter for the first year such depreciation is deducted.
        (2)  Expenditures  paid  or  incurred  during the taxable year for the
      construction, reconstruction, erection or acquisition  of  any  property
      such  as  described  in paragraph three or four of this subdivision, and
      subject to the conditions provided therein, which is used or to be  used
      for   purposes  of  research  or  development  in  the  experimental  or
      laboratory sense. Such purposes shall  not  be  deemed  to  include  the
      ordinary  testing  or  inspection  of  materials or products for quality
      control,  efficiency  surveys,  management  studies,  consumer  surveys,
      advertising,   promotions  or  research  in  connection  with  literary,
      historical or similar projects. Such deduction shall be allowed only  on
      condition  that,  in  the  case of an unincorporated business carried on
      both within and without this city, with respect to property described in
      paragraph four of this subdivision, such deduction does not  exceed  the
      expenditures  multiplied  by  (A)  the  percentage  of the excess of the
      taxpayer's unincorporated business gross income over its  unincorporated
      business deductions allocated to this city, or (B) the percentage of the
      taxpayer's   business  income  allocated  to  this  city,  whichever  is
      applicable, which percentage shall be determined under section 11-508 of
      this chapter for the first year such depreciation is deducted, and that,
      for the taxable year and all  succeeding  taxable  years,  no  deduction
      shall  be  allowed pursuant to section 11-507 of this chapter on account
      of such expenditures or on account of depreciation of the same property,
    
      except to the extent that its basis may be attributable to factors other
      than such expenditures, or in case a deduction is allowable pursuant  to
      this  paragraph  for only a part of such expenditures, on condition that
      any  deduction  allowable  for federal income tax purposes on account of
      such expenditures or on account of depreciation  of  the  same  property
      shall be proportionately reduced in determining the deductions allowable
      pursuant  to section 11-507 of this chapter for the taxable year and all
      succeeding taxable years. With respect to property which is used  or  to
      be  used  for research and development only in part, or during only part
      of its useful life, the deduction allowable pursuant to  this  paragraph
      shall  be  limited  to a proportionate part of the expenditures relating
      thereto. If a  deduction  shall  have  been  allowed  pursuant  to  this
      paragraph  for  all  or  part  of  such expenditures with respect to any
      property, and such property is used for purposes other than research and
      development to a greater extent than originally reported,  the  taxpayer
      shall  report  such  use  in the taxpayer's return for the first taxable
      year during which  it  occurs,  and  the  commissioner  of  finance  may
      recompute  the  tax  for  the year or years for which such deduction was
      allowed,  and  may  assess  any  additional  tax  resulting  from   such
      recomputation within the time fixed by subdivision (c) of section 11-523
      of this chapter.
        (3)  For  purposes  of this paragraph, such deduction shall be allowed
      only with respect to tangible property which is depreciable pursuant  to
      section  one  hundred sixty-seven of the internal revenue code, having a
      situs in the city and used in the  taxpayer's  trade  or  business,  (A)
      constructed,  reconstructed  or  erected  after  December  thirty-first,
      nineteen hundred sixty-five, pursuant to a contract  which  was,  on  or
      before  December  thirty-first, nineteen hundred sixty-seven, and at all
      times thereafter, binding on the taxpayer  or,  property,  the  physical
      construction,  reconstruction  or  erection  of which began on or before
      December thirty-first, nineteen hundred sixty-seven or which began after
      such  date  pursuant  to  an  order  placed  on   or   before   December
      thirty-first,  nineteen  hundred sixty-seven, and then only with respect
      to that portion of the basis thereof or the expenditure relating thereto
      which is properly attributable to such construction,  reconstruction  or
      erection  after  December  thirty-first, nineteen hundred sixty-five, or
      (B) acquired after December thirty-first, nineteen  hundred  sixty-five,
      pursuant  to  a  contract which was, on or before December thirty-first,
      nineteen hundred sixty-seven, and at all times  thereafter,  binding  on
      the  taxpayer  or  pursuant  to  an  order  placed on or before December
      thirty-first, nineteen hundred sixty-seven, by purchase  as  defined  in
      section  one  hundred  seventy-nine (d) of the internal revenue code, if
      the original use of such property commenced with the taxpayer, commenced
      in the city and commenced after December thirty-first, nineteen  hundred
      sixty-five  or  (C)  acquired,  constructed,  reconstructed,  or erected
      subsequent to December thirty-first, nineteen  hundred  sixty-seven,  if
      such  acquisition,  construction, reconstruction or erection is pursuant
      to a plan of the taxpayer which was in existence December  thirty-first,
      nineteen  hundred sixty-seven and not thereafter substantially modified,
      and such acquisition, construction,  reconstruction  or  erection  would
      qualify under the rules in paragraph four, five or six of subsection (h)
      of  section  forty-eight  of  the  internal  revenue  code  provided all
      references in such paragraphs four, five and six to  the  dates  October
      nine,  nineteen  hundred  sixty-six,  and  October ten, nineteen hundred
      sixty-six, shall be read  as  December  thirty-first,  nineteen  hundred
      sixty-seven.  A taxpayer shall be allowed a deduction under subparagraph
      (A), (B) or (C) of this paragraph only if the tangible property shall be
      delivered or the  construction,  reconstruction  or  erection  shall  be
    
      completed   on   or   before  December  thirty-first,  nineteen  hundred
      sixty-nine, except in the case of tangible property which  is  acquired,
      constructed,  reconstructed or erected pursuant to a contract which was,
      on or before December thirty-first, nineteen hundred sixty-seven, and at
      all  times thereafter, binding on the taxpayer. However, for any taxable
      year beginning on or after January first, nineteen hundred  sixty-eight,
      a  taxpayer shall not be allowed a deduction under paragraph one of this
      subdivision with respect to tangible personal  property  leased  to  any
      other person or corporation. For purposes of the preceding sentence, any
      contract  or  agreement  to  lease  or rent or for a license to use such
      property shall be considered a lease. With respect to property  which  a
      taxpayer uses for purposes other than leasing for part of a taxable year
      and leases for a part of a taxable year, a deduction under paragraph one
      may be taken in proportion to the part of the year such property is used
      by the taxpayer.
        (4)  For  purposes of this paragraph, such deductions shall be allowed
      only with respect to tangible property which is depreciable pursuant  to
      section  one  hundred sixty-seven of the internal revenue code, having a
      situs in this city and used in the taxpayer's trade or business, (A) the
      construction, reconstruction, or erection of which  is  completed  after
      December  thirty-first, nineteen hundred sixty-seven, and then only with
      respect to that  portion  of  the  basis  thereof  or  the  expenditures
      relating  thereto  which  is properly attributable to such construction,
      reconstruction or erection after December thirty-first, nineteen hundred
      sixty-three, or  (B)  acquired  after  December  thirty-first,  nineteen
      hundred  sixty-seven,  by  purchase  as  defined  in section one hundred
      seventy-nine (d) of the internal revenue code, if the  original  use  of
      such  property  commenced  with the taxpayer, commenced in this city and
      commenced after  December  thirty-first,  nineteen  hundred  sixty-five.
      Provided,  however,  a deduction under paragraph one of this subdivision
      shall be allowed with respect to property described  in  this  paragraph
      only  on  condition  that such property shall be principally used by the
      taxpayer in  the  production  of  goods  by  manufacturing;  processing;
      assembling;   refining;   mining;   extracting;   farming;  agriculture;
      horticulture;  floriculture;  viticulture  or  commercial  fishing.  For
      purposes of the preceding sentence, manufacturing shall mean the process
      of  working raw materials into wares suitable for use or which gives new
      shapes, new qualities or new combinations to matter  which  already  has
      gone  through  some  artificial  process by the use of machinery, tools,
      appliances, and other similar equipment. Property used in the production
      of goods shall include machinery, equipment or other  tangible  property
      which  is principally used in the repair and service of other machinery,
      equipment or other tangible property used principally in the  production
      of  goods  and  shall  include  all facilities used in the manufacturing
      operation, including storage of material to be used in manufacturing and
      of the products that are manufactured. At the option  of  the  taxpayer,
      air  and  water  pollution control facilities which qualify for elective
      deductions under subdivision nine of section 11-507 of this chapter  may
      be  treated,  for  purposes  of  this  paragraph,  as  tangible property
      principally  used  in  the  production  of   goods   by   manufacturing;
      processing;   assembling;   refining;   mining;   extracting;   farming;
      agriculture;  horticulture;  floriculture;  viticulture  or   commercial
      fishing,  in  which  event,  a  deduction  shall  not  be  allowed under
      subdivision nine of section 11-507 of this  chapter.  However,  for  any
      taxable  year  beginning  on  or  after  January first, nineteen hundred
      sixty-eight, a taxpayer shall not be allowed a deduction under paragraph
      one of this subdivision  with  respect  to  tangible  personal  property
      leased to any other person or corporation. For purposes of the preceding
    
      sentence, any contract or agreement to lease or rent or for a license to
      use  such property shall be considered a lease. With respect to property
      which a taxpayer uses for purposes other than  leasing  for  part  of  a
      taxable  year and leases for a part of a taxable year, a deduction under
      paragraph one shall be allowed in proportion to the  part  of  the  year
      such property is used by the taxpayer.
        (5)  If the deductions allowable for any taxable year pursuant to this
      subdivision  exceed  the  taxpayer's  unincorporated  business   taxable
      income,  determined without the allowance of such deductions, the excess
      may be carried over to the following taxable year or years  and  may  be
      deducted  (without  allocation  under section 11-508 of this chapter) in
      computing unincorporated business taxable income for such year or years.
        (6) In any taxable year when property is sold  or  otherwise  disposed
      of,  with  respect  to  which  a  deduction has been allowed pursuant to
      paragraph one or two of this subdivision, the  basis  of  such  property
      shall be adjusted to reflect the deductions so allowed, and if the basis
      as so adjusted is lower than the adjusted basis of the same property for
      federal  income  tax  purposes,  there  shall  be added to federal gross
      income the amount of the difference between such adjusted bases.

      an installment method, any additional tax for the year of such change of
      method and for any subsequent year, which is attributable to the receipt
      of installment payments properly accrued  in  a  prior  year,  shall  be
      reduced by the portion of tax for any prior taxable year attributable to
      the accrual of such installment payments, in accordance with regulations

Section 11-521 ::    
        
     
        ยง  11-521  Notice of deficiency. (a) General. If upon examination of a
      taxpayer's  return  under  this  chapter  the  commissioner  of  finance
      determines  that  there  is a deficiency of income tax, the commissioner
      may mail a notice of deficiency to the taxpayer. If a taxpayer fails  to
      file  a  return required under this chapter, the commissioner of finance
      is authorized to estimate the taxpayer's  city  unincorporated  business
      taxable   income   and   tax   thereon,  from  any  information  in  the
      commissioner's possession, and to mail a notice  of  deficiency  to  the
      taxpayer.  A  notice  of  deficiency  shall  be  mailed  by certified or
      registered mail to the taxpayer at his or her last known address  in  or
      out  of  the  city.  If  the  taxpayer  is  deceased  or  under  a legal
      disability, a notice of deficiency may be mailed  to  his  or  her  last
      known  address in or out of the city, unless the commissioner of finance
      has received notice of the existence of a  fiduciary  relationship  with
      respect to the taxpayer.
        (b)  Notice  of  deficiency  as assessment. After ninety days from the
      mailing of a notice of deficiency or, if the commissioner of finance has
      established a conciliation procedure pursuant to section 11-124  of  the
      code  and  the  taxpayer  has  requested  a  conciliation  conference in
      accordance  therewith,  after  ninety  days  from  the  mailing  of  the
      conciliation  decision or the date of the commissioner's confirmation of
      the discontinuance of the conciliation proceeding, such notice shall  be
      an  assessment of the amount of tax specified therein, together with the
      interest, additions to tax and penalties stated in such  notice,  except
      only  for  any  such  tax  or other amounts as to which the taxpayer has
      within such ninety day period filed with  the  tax  appeals  tribunal  a
      petition  under  section  11-529  of  this  chapter.  If  the  notice of
      deficiency or conciliation decision is addressed to a person outside  of
      the  United  States, such period shall be one hundred fifty days instead
      of ninety days.
        (c) Restrictions on assessment and levy. No assessment of a deficiency
      in tax and no levy or proceeding in court for its  collection  shall  be
      made,  begun  or  prosecuted,  except  as  otherwise provided in section
      11-534 of this chapter, until a notice of deficiency has been mailed  to
      the taxpayer, nor until the expiration of the time for filing a petition
      with the tax appeals tribunal contesting such notice, nor, if a petition
      with  respect  to  the  taxable  year  has  been  both  served  upon the
      commissioner of finance and filed with the tax appeals  tribunal,  until
      the decision of the tax appeals tribunal has become final. For exception
      in  the  case  of  judicial  review  of  the decision of the tax appeals
      tribunal, see subdivision (c) of section 11-530 of this chapter.
        (d) Exceptions  for  mathematical  errors.  If  a  mathematical  error
      appears  on  a  return (including an overstatement of the amount paid as
      estimated tax), the commissioner of finance shall  notify  the  taxpayer
      that  an  amount  of tax in excess of that shown upon the return is due,
      and that such excess has been assessed.
        Such notice shall not be considered as a notice of deficiency for  the
      purposes  of  this  section,  subdivision  (f) of section 11-527 of this
      chapter (limiting credits or refunds after petition to the  tax  appeals
      tribunal),  or  subdivision  (b)  of  section  11-529  of  this  chapter
      (authorizing the filing of a petition  with  the  tax  appeals  tribunal
      based on a notice of deficiency) nor shall such assessment or collection
      be prohibited by the provisions of subdivision (c) of this section.
        (e) Exception where change in federal or New York state taxable income
      is not reported.
        (1)  If  the  taxpayer  fails  to  comply  with section 11-519 of this
      chapter in not reporting a change or correction increasing or decreasing
      the taxpayer's federal or New York state taxable income as  reported  on
    
      the  taxpayer's  federal  or New York state return or in not reporting a
      change or correction which is treated in the same manner as if it were a
      deficiency for federal or New York state income tax purposes or  in  not
      filing  an  amended return or in not reporting the execution of a notice
      of waiver described in such section, instead of the  mode  and  time  of
      assessment  provided  for  in  subdivision  (b)  of  this  section,  the
      commissioner of finance may assess a deficiency based upon such  changed
      or  corrected federal or New York state taxable income by mailing to the
      taxpayer a notice of additional tax due specifying  the  amount  of  the
      deficiency,  and  such deficiency, together with the interest, additions
      to tax and penalties stated in such notice, shall be deemed assessed  on
      the  date  such  notice  is  mailed  unless within thirty days after the
      mailing of such notice a report of the federal or New York state  change
      or  correction  or  an amended return, where such return was required by
      section 11-519 of this chapter, is  filed  accompanied  by  a  statement
      showing  wherein  such  federal or New York state determination and such
      notice of additional tax due are erroneous.
        (2) Such notice shall not be considered as a notice of deficiency  for
      the  purposes of this section, subdivision (f) of section 11-527 of this
      chapter (limiting credits or refunds after petition to the  tax  appeals
      tribunal),  or  subdivision  (b)  of  section  11-529  of  this  chapter
      (authorizing the filing of a petition  with  the  tax  appeals  tribunal
      based  on  a  notice  of  deficiency),  nor  shall  such  assessment  or
      collection thereof be prohibited by the provisions of subdivision (c) of
      this section.
        (3) If the taxpayer is deceased or under a legal disability, a  notice
      of  additional tax due may be mailed to his or her last known address in
      or out of the city, unless the  commissioner  of  finance  has  received
      notice  of the existence of a fiduciary relationship with respect to the
      taxpayer.
        (f) Waiver of restrictions. The taxpayer shall at any time (whether or
      not a notice of deficiency has been issued) have the right to waive  the
      restrictions  on  assessment  and collection of the whole or any part of
      the deficiency by a signed notice in writing filed with the commissioner
      of finance.
        (g) Deficiency defined. For purposes of  this  chapter,  a  deficiency
      means the amount of the tax imposed by this chapter, less (i) the amount
      shown as the tax upon the taxpayer's return (whether the return was made
      or  the tax computed by the taxpayer or by the commissioner of finance),
      and less, (ii) the amounts previously  assessed  (or  collected  without
      assessment)  as  a  deficiency and plus (iii) the amount of any rebates.
      For the purpose of this definition, the tax imposed by this chapter  and
      the  tax  shown on the return shall both be determined without regard to
      payments on account of estimated tax; and a rebate means so much  of  an
      abatement,  credit, refund or other repayment (whether or not erroneous)
      made on the ground that the amounts entering into the  definition  of  a
      deficiency showed a balance in favor of the taxpayer.
        (h) Exception where change or correction of sales and compensating use
      tax  liability  is  not reported. (1) If a taxpayer fails to comply with
      section 11-519.1 of this chapter in not reporting a change or correction
      of his or her sales and compensating use tax liability or in not  filing
      a  copy  of an amended return or report relating to his or her sales and
      compensating use  tax  liability,  instead  of  the  mode  and  time  of
      assessment  provided  for  in  subdivision  (b)  of  this  section,  the
      commissioner of finance may assess a deficiency based upon such  changed
      or  corrected  sales and compensating use tax liability, as same relates
      to credits claimed under this chapter  by  mailing  to  the  taxpayer  a
      notice  of  additional  tax due specifying the amount of the deficiency,
    
      and such deficiency, together with the interest, additions  to  tax  and
      penalties  stated  in  such notice, shall be deemed assessed on the date
      such notice is mailed unless within thirty days  after  the  mailing  of
      such  notice  a report of the state change or correction or a copy of an
      amended return or report,  where  such  copy  was  required  by  section
      11-519.1  of  this  chapter, is filed accompanied by a statement showing
      where such state determination and such notice of additional tax due are
      erroneous.
        (2) Such notice shall not be considered as a notice of deficiency  for
      the  purposes of this section, subdivision (f) of section 11-527 of this
      chapter (limiting credits or refunds after petition to the  tax  appeals
      tribunal),  or  subdivision  (b)  of  section  11-529  of  this  chapter
      (authorizing the filing of a petition  with  the  tax  appeals  tribunal
      based  on  a  notice  of  deficiency),  nor shall such assessment or the
      collection thereof be prohibited by the provisions of subdivision (c) of
      this section.
        (3) If the taxpayer is deceased or under a legal disability, a  notice
      of  additional tax due may be mailed to his or her last known address in
      or out of the city, and such notice shall be sufficient for purposes  of
      this  chapter. If the commissioner of finance has received notice that a
      person is acting for the taxpayer in a fiduciary  capacity,  a  copy  of
      such notice shall also be mailed to the fiduciary named in such notice.

      assessed on the date of filing of  the  return  (including  any  amended
      return  showing  an  increase  of tax). In the case of a return properly
      filed without computation of tax, the tax computed by  the  commissioner
      of  finance  shall be deemed to be assessed on the date on which payment
      is due. If a notice of deficiency has been mailed,  the  amount  of  the
      deficiency  shall  be  deemed  to  be  assessed on the date specified in

      state adjustment, change or correction, any deficiency in tax under this
      chapter  resulting  therefrom shall be deemed to be assessed on the date
      of filing such report or amended return, and such  assessment  shall  be

      amended return, where such return was required by section 11-519 of this
      chapter is filed accompanied by a statement showing wherein such federal
      or  New  York  state determination and such notice of additional tax due
      are erroneous.
        If a notice of additional tax due, as prescribed in subdivision (h) of

      determination and such notice of additional tax due are erroneous.
        Any amount paid as a tax or in respect of a tax,  other  than  amounts
      paid  as  estimated  income tax, shall be deemed to be assessed upon the
      date of receipt of payment, notwithstanding any other provisions.
        (b) Other assessment powers. If the mode or time for the assessment of
      any tax under this chapter (including interest,  additions  to  tax  and
      assessable penalties) is not otherwise provided for, the commissioner of
      finance may establish the same by regulations.
        (c)  Estimated  income  tax.  No  unpaid amount of estimated tax under

      time  within  the  period prescribed for assessment, make a supplemental
      assessment, subject to the provisions of section 11-521 of this  chapter
      where  applicable,  whenever  it  is  ascertained that any assessment is

        (c) Exceptions. (1) Assessment at any time. The tax may be assessed at
      any time if:
        (A) no return is filed,
        (B) a false or fraudulent return is filed with intent to evade tax,
        (C) the taxpayer fails to comply with section 11-519 of  this  chapter
      in  not  reporting  a  change or correction increasing or decreasing the
      taxpayer's federal or New York state taxable income as reported  on  the
      taxpayer's federal or New York state income tax return, or the execution
      of  a  notice  of  waiver  and the changes or corrections on which it is
      based or in not reporting a change or correction which is treated in the
      same manner as if it were a deficiency for federal  or  New  York  state
      income tax purposes, or in not filing an amended return, or

      credit against the tax imposed by this chapter was claimed.
        (2)  Extension  by agreement. Where, before the expiration of the time
      prescribed  in  this  section  for  the  assessment  of  tax,  both  the
      commissioner  of  finance  and the taxpayer have consented in writing to
      its assessment after such time, the tax may  be  assessed  at  any  time
      prior  to the expiration of the period agreed upon. The period so agreed
      upon may be extended by subsequent agreements in writing made before the
      expiration of the period previously agreed upon.
        (3) Report of changed or corrected federal or New York  state  income.
      If  the  taxpayer  shall,  pursuant  to  section 11-519 of this chapter,

      decreasing  federal  or  New  York  state  taxable  income or report the
      execution of a notice of waiver and the changes and corrections on which
      it is based, or a change or correction which  is  treated  in  the  same
      manner  as  if it were a deficiency for federal or New York state income
      tax purposes, the assessment (if not deemed to have been made  upon  the
      filing  of  the report or amended return) may be made at any time within
      two years after such report or amended return was filed. The  amount  of
      such  assessment  of  tax shall not exceed the amount of the increase in
      city tax attributable to such  federal  or  New  York  state  change  or
      correction.  The  provisions of this paragraph shall not affect the time
      within which or the amount for which  an  assessment  may  otherwise  be
      made.

      deficiency for the taxable year of the loss may be assessed.
        (5) Recovery  of  erroneous  refund.  An  erroneous  refund  shall  be
      considered an underpayment of tax on the date made, and an assessment of
      a  deficiency arising out of an erroneous refund may be made at any time
      within two years  from  the  making  of  the  refund,  except  that  the
      assessment  may  be made within five years from the making of the refund
      if it appears that any part of  the  refund  was  induced  by  fraud  or
      misrepresentation of a material fact.
    
        (6)  Request  for  prompt  assessment.  If  a return is required for a
      decedent or for his or her estate during the period  of  administration,

      therefor (made after the return is filed) by the executor, administrator
      or  other  person representing the estate of such decedent, but not more
      than three years  after  the  return  was  filed,  except  as  otherwise
      provided in this subdivision and subdivision (d) of this section.

      research and development to a greater extent than originally reported.
        (8)   Report   concerning   waste   treatment   facility.   Under  the
      circumstances described in paragraph nine  of  section  11-507  of  this
      chapter,  the tax may be assessed within three years after the filing of
      the return containing the information required by such paragraph.
        (9) Report of changed or corrected  sales  and  compensating  use  tax
      liability.  If  the  taxpayer files a report or amended return or report
      required under section 11-519.1 of this chapter, in respect of a  change
      or   correction  of  sales  and  compensating  use  tax  liability,  the
      assessment (if not deemed to have been  made  upon  the  filing  of  the
      report)  may  be  made at any time within two years after such report or
      amended return or report was filed. The amount of such assessment of tax
      shall not exceed the amount of the increase in city tax attributable  to
      such  state change or correction. The provisions of this paragraph shall
      not affect the time within which or the amount for which  an  assessment
      may otherwise be made.
        (d)  Omission of income on return. The tax may be assessed at any time
      within six years after the return was filed if (1) a taxpayer omits from
      his or her city unincorporated business gross income an amount  properly
      includible  therein  which is in excess of twenty-five per centum of the
      amount of city  unincorporated  business  gross  income  stated  in  the
      return,  or  (2)  an  estate or trust omits income from its return in an
      amount in excess of twenty-five percent of its income determined  as  if
      it were an individual.
        For purposes of this subdivision there shall not be taken into account
      any amount which is omitted in the return if such amount is disclosed in
      the  return,  or  in  a  statement  attached  to the return, in a manner
      adequate to apprise the commissioner of finance of the nature and amount
      of such item.
        (e) Suspension of running of period of limitation. The running of  the
      period of limitations on assessment or collection of tax or other amount
      (or of a transferee's liability) shall, after the mailing of a notice of
      deficiency, be suspended for the period during which the commissioner of
      finance  is  prohibited  under subdivision (c) of section 11-521 of this
      chapter from making the assessment or from collecting by levy.

Section 11-524 ::    
        
     
        ยง  11-524  Interest on underpayment. (a) General. If any amount of tax
      is not paid on or before the last date prescribed in  this  chapter  for
      payment,  interest  on  such  amount at the underpayment rate set by the
      commissioner of finance pursuant to section 11-537 of this chapter,  or,
      if  no  rate is set, at the rate of seven and one-half percent per annum
      shall be paid for the period from such  last  date  to  the  date  paid,
      whether  or  not any extension of time for payment was granted. Interest
      under this subdivision shall not be paid if the amount thereof  is  less
      than one dollar.
        (b) Exception as to estimated tax. This section shall not apply to any
      failure to pay estimated tax under section 11-512 of this chapter.
        (c)  Exception for mathematical error. No interest shall be imposed on
      any underpayment of tax due solely to mathematical error if the taxpayer
      files a return within the time prescribed in this chapter (including any
      extension of time) and pays the  amount  of  underpayment  within  three
      months after the due date of such return, as it may be extended.
        (d)   Suspension   of   interest  on  deficiencies.  If  a  waiver  of
      restrictions on assessment  of  a  deficiency  has  been  filed  by  the
      taxpayer,  and  if  notice and demand by the commissioner of finance for
      payment of such deficiency is not made  within  thirty  days  after  the
      filing  of such waiver, interest shall not be imposed on such deficiency
      for the period beginning immediately after such thirtieth day and ending
      with the date of notice and demand.
        (e) Tax reduced by carryback. If the the amount of tax for any taxable
      year is reduced by reason of a carryback of a net operating  loss,  such
      reduction in tax shall not affect the computation of interest under this
      section  for the period ending with the filing date for the taxable year
      in which the net operating  loss  arises.  Such  filing  date  shall  be
      determined without regard to extensions of time to file.
        (f) Interest treated as tax. Interest under this section shall be paid
      upon  notice and demand and shall be assessed, collected and paid in the
      same manner as tax. Any reference in this chapter to the tax imposed  by
      this  chapter  shall be deemed also to refer to interest imposed by this
      section on such tax.
        (g) Interest on penalties or  additions  to  tax.  Interest  shall  be
      imposed  under  subdivision  (a)  of  this  section  in  respect  of any
      assessable penalty or addition to tax only if such assessable penalty or
      addition to tax is not paid within ten days from the date of the  notice
      and  demand  therefor  under  subdivision  (b) of section 11-532 of this
      chapter, and in such case interest shall be imposed only for the  period
      from such date of the notice and demand to the date of payment.
        (h)  Payment  within  ten  days after notice and demand. If notice and
      demand is made for payment  of  any  amount  under  subdivision  (b)  of
      section  11-532  of  this chapter, and if such amount is paid within ten
      days after the date of such  notice  and  demand,  interest  under  this
      section  on the amount so paid shall not be imposed for the period after
      the date of such notice and demand.
        (i) Limitation on assessment and collection. Interest prescribed under
      this section may be assessed and collected at any time during the period
      within which the tax or other amount to which such interest relates  may
      be assessed and collected, respectively.
        (j)  Interest  on erroneous refund. Any portion of tax or other amount
      which has been erroneously refunded, and which  is  recoverable  by  the
      commissioner  of  finance,  shall bear interest at the underpayment rate
      set by the commissioner of finance pursuant to section  11-537  of  this
      chapter,  or,  if  no  rate  is  set,  at the rate of seven and one-half
      percent per annum from the date of the payment of the refund,  but  only
    
      if  it  appears  that  any  part of the refund was induced by fraud or a
      misrepresentation of a material fact.
        (k)  Satisfaction  by credits. If any portion of a tax is satisfied by
      credit of an overpayment, then no interest shall be imposed  under  this
      section  on  the  portion  of the tax so satisfied for any period during
      which, if the credit  had  not  been  made,  interest  would  have  been
      allowable with respect to such overpayment.

Section 11-525 ::    
        
     
        ยง 11-525 Additions to tax and civil penalties. (a) (1) Failure to file
      tax  return.  (A)  In  case  of  failure to file a tax return under this
      chapter on or before the prescribed date (determined with regard to  any
      extension  of  time for filing), unless it is shown that such failure is
      due to reasonable cause and not due to willful neglect, there  shall  be
      added  to  the  amount  required  to be shown as tax on such return five
      percent of the amount of such tax if the failure is for  not  more  than
      one  month, with an additional five percent for each additional month or
      fraction thereof during which  such  failure  continues,  not  exceeding
      twenty-five percent in the aggregate.
        (B) In the case of a failure to file a tax return within sixty days of
      the date prescribed for filing of such return (determined with regard to
      any  extension of time for filing), unless it is shown that such failure
      is due to reasonable cause and not due to willful neglect, the  addition
      to  tax  under subparagraph (A) of this paragraph shall not be less than
      the lesser of one hundred dollars or one hundred percent of  the  amount
      required to be shown as tax on such return.
        (C)  For  purposes of this paragraph, the amount of tax required to be
      shown on the return shall be reduced by the amount of any  part  of  the
      tax  which  is  paid on or before the date prescribed for payment of the
      tax and by the amount of any credit against the tax which may be claimed
      upon the return.
        (2) Failure to pay tax shown on return. In case of failure to pay  the
      amounts  shown  as  tax  on  any  return required to be filed under this
      chapter on or before the prescribed date (determined with regard to  any
      extension  of time for payment), unless it is shown that such failure is
      due to reasonable cause and not due to willful neglect, there  shall  be
      added  to the amount shown as tax on such return one-half of one percent
      of the amount of such tax if the failure is not for more than one month,
      with an additional one-half of one percent for each additional month  or
      fraction  thereof  during  which  such  failure continues, not exceeding
      twenty-five percent in the aggregate. For the purpose of  computing  the
      addition  for  any month, the amount of tax shown on the return shall be
      reduced by the amount of any part of the tax which is paid on or  before
      the  beginning of such month and by the amount of any credit against the
      tax which may be claimed upon the return. If the amount of tax  required
      to  be  shown  on  a return is less than the amount shown as tax on such
      return, this paragraph shall  be  applied  by  substituting  such  lower
      amount.
        (3)  Failure  to  pay  tax  required to be shown on return. In case of
      failure to pay any amount in respect of any tax required to be shown  on
      a  return  required to be filed under this chapter which is not so shown
      (including an assessment made pursuant to  subdivision  (a)  of  section
      11-522  of  this  chapter)  within  ten days of the date of a notice and
      demand therefor, unless  it  is  shown  that  such  failure  is  due  to
      reasonable cause and not due to willful neglect, there shall be added to
      the  amount  of  tax  stated  in  such notice and demand one-half of one
      percent of such tax if the failure is not for more than one month,  with
      an  additional  one-half  of  one  percent  for each additional month or
      fraction thereof during which  such  failure  continues,  not  exceeding
      twenty-five  percent  in the aggregate. For the purpose of computing the
      addition for any month, the amount of  tax  stated  in  the  notice  and
      demand  shall  be  reduced by the amount of any part of the tax which is
      paid before the beginning of such month.
        (4) Limitations on additions. (A)  With  respect  to  any  return  the
      amount  of the addition under paragraph one of this subdivision shall be
      reduced by the amount of  the  addition  under  paragraph  two  of  this
      subdivision  for  any  month  to  which  an  addition applies under both
    
      paragraphs one and two of this subdivision. In  any  case  described  in
      subparagraph (B) of paragraph one of this subdivision, the amount of the
      addition  under such paragraph one shall not be reduced below the amount
      provided in such subparagraph.
        (B)  With  respect  to  any return, the maximum amount of the addition
      permitted under paragraph three of this subdivision shall be reduced  by
      the  amount  of  the  addition  under  paragraph one of this subdivision
      (determined without regard to subparagraph (B) of  such  paragraph  one)
      which is attributable to the tax for which the notice and demand is made
      and which is not paid within ten days of such notice and demand.
        * (b) Deficiency due to negligence. (1) If any part of a deficiency is
      due  to  negligence or intentional disregard of this chapter or rules or
      regulations hereunder (but without intent to defraud),  there  shall  be
      added to the tax an amount equal to five percent of the deficiency.
        (2)  There  shall  be  added  to  the  tax  (in addition to the amount
      determined under paragraph (1) of this subdivision) an amount  equal  to
      fifty  percent  of the interest payable under subdivision (a) of section
      11-524 with respect to the portion of the deficiency described  in  such
      paragraph  (1)  which  is  attributable to the negligence or intentional
      disregard referred to in such paragraph (1), for the period beginning on
      the  last  date  prescribed  by  law  for  payment  of  such  deficiency
      (determined  without  regard to any extension) and ending on the date of
      the assessment of the tax (or, if earlier, the date of  the  payment  of
      the tax).
        (3)  If  any payment is shown on a return made by a payor with respect
      to dividends, patronage dividends and interest under subsection  (a)  of
      section  six  thousand forty-two, subsection (a) of section six thousand
      forty-four or subsection (a) of section six thousand forty-nine  of  the
      internal  revenue code of nineteen hundred fifty-four, respectively, and
      the payee fails to include any portion of such payment in unincorporated
      business gross income, as that term is defined in  section  11-506,  any
      portion  of  a deficiency attributable to such failure shall be treated,
      for purposes of this subdivision, as due to negligence in the absence of
      clear and convincing evidence to the contrary. If any addition to tax is
      imposed under this subdivision by reason of the preceding sentence,  the
      amount  of  the  addition  to  tax  imposed  by  paragraph  one  of this
      subdivision shall be five percent of the portion of the deficiency which
      is attributable to the failure described in the preceding sentence.

        (c) Failure to file declaration or underpayment of estimated  tax.  If
      any  taxpayer  fails  to file a declaration of estimated tax or fails to
      pay all or any part of an installment of  estimated  tax,  the  taxpayer
      shall  be  deemed  to  have made an underpayment of estimated tax. There
      shall be added to the  tax  for  the  taxable  year  an  amount  at  the
      underpayment rate set by the commissioner of finance pursuant to section
      11-537  of this chapter, or, if no rate is set, at the rate of seven and
      one-half percent per annum upon the amount of the underpayment  for  the
      period  of  the  underpayment  but  not  beyond the fifteenth day of the
      fourth month following the close of the taxable year. The amount of  the
      underpayment  shall be the excess of the amount of the installment which
      would be required to be paid if the estimated tax were equal  to  ninety
      percent  of  the  tax shown on the return for the taxable year (or if no
      return was filed, ninety percent of the tax  for  such  year)  over  the
      amount,  if  any,  of  the  installment  paid  on or before the last day
      prescribed for such payment. No underpayment shall be  deemed  to  exist
      with  respect  to a declaration or installment otherwise due on or after
      the  taxpayer's  death.  In  any  case  in  which  there  would  be   no
      underpayment  if  this  subdivision were applied by substituting "eighty
    
      percent" for "ninety percent" where it appears in the  second  preceding
      sentence,  the  addition to tax under this subdivision shall be equal to
      seventy-five percent of  the  amount  otherwise  determined  under  this
      subdivision.
        (d)  Exception  to  addition  for  underpayment  of estimated tax. The
      addition to tax under subdivision (c) of this section  with  respect  to
      any  underpayment  of  any installment shall not be imposed if the total
      amount of all payments of estimated tax made on or before the last  date
      prescribed  for  the  payment  of  such  installment  equals  or exceeds
      whichever of the following is the lesser:
        (1) The amount which would have been required to be paid on or  before
      such  date  if  the estimated tax were whichever of the following is the
      least:
        (A) The tax shown on the return of  the  taxpayer  for  the  preceding
      taxable  year,  if a return showing a liability for tax was filed by the
      taxpayer for the preceding taxable year and such preceding  year  was  a
      taxable year of twelve months, or
        (B)  An  amount  equal to the tax computed, at the rates applicable to
      the taxable year, but otherwise on the basis of the facts shown  on  the
      taxpayer's  return for, and the law applicable to, the preceding taxable
      year, or
        (C) An amount equal to ninety percent of the tax for the taxable  year
      computed  by  placing on an annualized basis the unincorporated business
      taxable income for the months in the  taxable  year  ending  before  the
      month  in  which the installment is required to be paid. For purposes of
      this subparagraph, the unincorporated business taxable income  shall  be
      placed on an annualized basis by:
        (i)  multiplying  by twelve (or, in the case of a taxable year of less
      than twelve months, the number  of  months  in  the  taxable  year)  the
      unincorporated  business  taxable  income  for the months in the taxable
      year ending before the month in which the installment is required to  be
      paid, and
        (ii)  dividing  the  resulting  amount  by the number of months in the
      taxable year ending before the month  in  which  such  installment  date
      falls, or
        (D)(i) If the base period percentage for any six consecutive months of
      the  taxable  year equals or exceeds seventy percent, an amount equal to
      ninety percent of the tax determined in the following manner:
        (I) take the unincorporated business taxable  income  for  all  months
      during the taxable year preceding the filing month,
        (II)  divide  such amount by the base period percentage for all months
      during the taxable year preceding the filing month,
        (III) determine the tax on  the  amounts  determined  under  subclause
      (II), and
        (IV)  multiply  the  tax  determined under subclause (III) by the base
      period percentage for the filing month and all months during the taxable
      year preceding the filing month.
        (ii) For purposes of clause (i) of this subparagraph:
        (I) the base period percentage for any period of months shall  be  the
      average percent which the unincorporated business taxable income for the
      corresponding  months  in each of the three preceding years bears to the
      unincorporated business taxable income for the three  preceding  taxable
      years.  The  commissioner  of finance may by regulations provide for the
      determination  of  the  base  period  percentage  in  the  case  of  new
      unincorporated businesses and other similar circumstances, and
        (II)  the term "filing month" means the month in which the installment
      is required to be paid;
    
        (2) An amount equal to ninety percent of  the  tax  computed,  at  the
      rates  applicable  to  the  taxable  year,  on  the  basis of the actual
      unincorporated business taxable income for the  months  in  the  taxable
      year  ending before the month in which the installment is required to be
      paid.
        (e)(1)  Except  as provided in paragraph two hereof, subparagraphs (A)
      and (B) of paragraph one of subdivision (d) of this  section  shall  not
      apply  in  the  case  of  any taxpayer which had unincorporated business
      taxable income, or the portion thereof allocated within the city, of one
      million dollars or more for any taxable year during  the  three  taxable
      years immediately preceding the taxable year involved.
        (2)  The  amount  treated as the estimated tax under subparagraphs (A)
      and (B) of paragraph one of subdivision (d) of this section shall in  no
      event  be  less than seventy-five percent of the tax shown on the return
      for the taxable year beginning in nineteen hundred eighty-three  or,  if
      no return was filed, seventy-five percent of the tax for such year.
        (f)  Deficiency  due to fraud.  (1) If any part of a deficiency is due
      to fraud, there shall be added to the tax an amount equal to  two  times
      the deficiency.
        (3) The addition to tax under this subdivision shall be in lieu of any
      other addition to tax imposed by subdivision (a) or (b).
        (g)  Additional  penalty. Any taxpayer who with fradulent intent shall
      fail to pay any tax, or to make, render, sign or certify any  return  or
      declaration  of  estimated  tax, or to supply any information within the
      time required by or under this chapter shall be liable to a  penalty  of
      not  more  than  one  thousand dollars, in addition to any other amounts
      required under this chapter, to be imposed, assessed  and  collected  by
      the  commissioner of finance. The commissioner of finance shall have the
      power, in his or her discretion, to  waive,  reduce  or  compromise  any
      penalty under this subdivision.
        * (h)  Additions  treated  as  tax. The additions to tax and penalties
      provided by this section shall be paid upon notice and demand and  shall
      be  assessed,  collected  and  paid in the same manner as taxes, and any
      reference in this chapter to tax or tax imposed by this  chapter,  shall
      be  deemed  also to refer to the additions to tax and penalties provided
      by this section. For purposes of section 11-521, this subdivision  shall
      not apply to--
        (1)  any  addition  to  tax  under  subdivision  (a) except as to that
      portion attributable to a deficiency;
        (2) any addition to tax under subdivision (c); and
        (3) any additional penalties under subdivisions (g) and (k).
        * NB Amended Ch. 765/85 ยง 68, language juxtaposed per Ch. 907/85 ยง 14
        (i) Determination of deficiency. For purposes of subdivisions (b)  and
      (c)  of  this section, the amounts shown as the tax by the taxpayer upon
      his or her return shall be taken into account in determining the  amount
      of  the  deficiency  only if such return was filed on or before the last
      day prescribed for the filing of such return, determined with regard  to
      any extension of time for such filing.
        * (j)   Substantial   understatement  of  liability.  If  there  is  a
      substantial understatement of tax for any taxable year, there  shall  be
      added  to  the  tax  an amount equal to ten percent of the amount of any
      underpayment attributable to such understatement. For purposes  of  this
      subdivision,  there  is  a  substantial  understatement  of  tax for any
      taxable year if the amount of the understatement for  the  taxable  year
      exceeds  the  greater  of ten percent of the tax required to be shown on
      the return for the taxable year, or five thousand dollars. For  purposes
      of the preceding sentence, the term "understatement" means the excess of
      the amount of the tax required to be shown on the return for the taxable
    
      year,  over  the amount of the tax imposed which is shown on the return,
      reduced by any rebate (within the meaning of subdivision (g) of  section
      11-521).    The  amount  of such understatement shall be reduced by that
      portion of the understatement which is attributable to the tax treatment
      of any item by the taxpayer if there is or was substantial authority for
      such  treatment,  or  any  item with respect to which the relevant facts
      affecting the item's tax  treatment  are  adequately  disclosed  in  the
      return  or  in  a  statement attached to the return. The commissioner of
      finance may waive all or any part of the addition  to  tax  provided  by
      this  subdivision on a showing by the taxpayer that there was reasonable
      cause for the understatement (or part thereof)  and  that  the  taxpayer
      acted in good faith.

        * (k)  Aiding  or  assisting  in  the  giving  of  fraudulent returns,

Section 11-526 ::    
        
     
        ยง  11-526    Overpayment.  (a)  General.  The commissioner of finance,
      within the applicable period of limitations, may credit  an  overpayment
      of tax and interest on such overpayment against any liability in respect
      of  any  tax  imposed  by this chapter or by chapters six, seventeen and
      nineteen of this title, on the person  who  made  overpayment,  and  the
      balance shall be refunded.
        (b)  Credits  against  estimated  tax. The commissioner of finance may
      prescribe regulations providing for the crediting against the  estimated
      tax  for  any taxable year of the amount determined to be an overpayment
      of the tax for a preceding taxable year. If any overpayment of tax is so
      claimed as a credit against estimated tax  for  the  succeeding  taxable
      year,  such  amount  shall be considered as a payment of the tax for the
      succeeding taxable year (whether or not  claimed  as  a  credit  in  the
      declaration  of  estimated tax for such succeeding taxable year), and no
      claim for credit or refund of such overpayment shall be allowed for  the
      taxable year for which the overpayment arises.
        (c)  Rule  where  no tax liability. If there is no tax liability for a
      period in respect of which an amount is paid as tax, such  amount  shall
      be considered an overpayment.
        (d)  Assessment  and collection after limitation period. If any amount
      of income tax is assessed or  collected  after  the  expiration  of  the
      period  of limitations properly applicable thereto, such amount shall be
      considered an overpayment.
        (e) Notwithstanding any provision of law in article fifty-two  of  the
      civil  practice  law  and  rules to the contrary, the procedures for the
      enforcement of money judgments shall not  apply  to  the  department  of
      finance,  or to any officer or employee of the department of finance, as
      a garnishee, with respect to any amount  of  money  to  be  refunded  or
      credited to a taxpayer under this chapter.

Section 11-527 ::    
        
     
        ยง 11-527 Limitation on credit or refund. (a) General. Claim for credit
      or refund of an overpayment of tax shall be filed by the taxpayer within
      three  years  from  the  time the return was filed or two years from the
      time the tax was paid, whichever of such periods expires the  later,  or
      if no return was filed, within two years from the time the tax was paid.
      If  the  claim  is filed within the three year period, the amount of the
      credit or refund shall not exceed the portion of the tax paid within the
      three years immediately preceding the  filing  of  the  claim  plus  the
      period  of  any extension of time for filing the return. If the claim is
      not filed within the three year period, but is filed within the two year
      period, the amount of the credit or refund shall not exceed the  portion
      of the tax paid during the two years immediately preceding the filing of
      the  claim. Except as otherwise provided in this section, if no claim is
      filed, the amount of a credit or refund  shall  not  exceed  the  amount
      which  would  be  allowable  if  a  claim had been filed on the date the
      credit or refund is allowed.
        (b) Extension  of  time  by  agreement.  If  an  agreement  under  the
      provisions of paragraph two of subdivision (c) of section 11-523 of this
      chapter  (extending  the  period  for  assessment of income tax) is made
      within the period prescribed in subdivision (a) of this section for  the
      filing of a claim for credit or refund the period for filing a claim for
      credit  or  refund,  or  for making credit or refund if no claims filed,
      shall not expire prior to six months after the expiration of the  period
      within  which an assessment may be made pursuant to the agreement or any
      extension thereof. The amount of such credit or refund shall not  exceed
      the  portion  of  the  tax paid after the execution of the agreement and
      before the filing of the claim or the making of the credit or refund, as
      the case may be, plus the portion of the  tax  paid  within  the  period
      which  would  be  applicable  under subdivision (a) of this section if a
      claim had been filed on the date the agreement was executed.
        (c) Notice of change or  correction  of  federal  or  New  York  state
      taxable  income.  If  a  taxpayer  is required by section 11-519 of this
      chapter to report a change or correction in federal or  New  York  state
      taxable  income  reported  on  the  taxpayer's federal or New York state
      income tax return, or to report a change or correction which is  treated
      in  the same manner as if it were an overpayment for federal or New York
      state income tax purposes,  or  to  file  an  amended  return  with  the
      commissioner  of  finance,  claim  for credit or refund of any resulting
      overpayment of tax shall be filed by the taxpayer within two years  from
      the  time the notice of such change or correction or such amended return
      was required to be filed with the commissioner of finance. If the report
      or amended return required by section 11-519  of  this  chapter  is  not
      filed  within the ninety day period therein specified, no interest shall
      be payable on  any  claim  for  credit  or  refund  of  the  overpayment
      attributable  to the federal or New York state change or correction. The
      amount of such credit or refund shall  not  exceed  the  amount  of  the
      reduction  in tax attributable to such federal or New York state change,
      correction or items amended on the taxpayer's  amended  federal  or  New
      York state income tax return. This subdivision shall not affect the time
      within which or the amount for which a claim for credit or refund may be
      filed apart from this subdivision.
        (d)  Overpayment attributable to net operating loss carryback. A claim
      for credit or refund of so much of an overpayment as is attributable  to
      the  application to the taxpayer of a net operating loss carryback shall
      be filed within three years from the time the return  was  due  for  the
      taxable year of the loss, or within the period prescribed in subdivision
      (b)  of  this  section  in  respect  of such taxable year, or within the
      period prescribed in subdivision (c) of this section,  where  applicable
    
      in  respect  of  the  taxable  year  to  which the net operating loss is
      carried back, whichever expires the latest.
        (e)  Failure  to  file  claim  within  prescribed period. No credit or
      refund shall be allowed or made, except as provided in  subdivision  (f)
      of  this  section  or  subdivision (d) of section 11-530 of this chapter
      after the expiration of the applicable period of limitation specified in
      this chapter unless a claim  for  credit  or  refund  is  filed  by  the
      taxpayer  within  such  period.  Any  later credit shall be void and any
      later refund erroneous. No period of limitations specified in any  other
      law  shall apply to the recovery by a taxpayer of moneys paid in respect
      of taxes under this chapter.
        (f) Effect of petition  to  tax  appeals  tribunal.  If  a  notice  of
      deficiency  for  a  taxable  year  has been mailed to the taxpayer under
      section 11-521 of this chapter  and  if  the  taxpayer  files  a  timely
      petition  with  the  tax  appeals  tribunal under section 11-529 of this
      chapter, the tax appeals tribunal may determine that  the  taxpayer  has
      made  an  overpayment for such year (whether or not it also determines a
      deficiency for such year). No separate claim for credit  or  refund  for
      such year shall be filed, and no credit or refund for such year shall be
      allowed or made, except:
        (1)  as  to  overpayments  determined by a decision of the tax appeals
      tribunal which has become final;
        (2) as to any amount collected in excess  of  an  amount  computed  in
      accordance  with  the  decision  of  the  tax appeals tribunal which has
      become final;
        (3) as to any amount collected after the period of limitation upon the
      making of levy for collection has expired; and
        (4) as to any amount claimed as a result of  a  change  or  correction
      described in subdivision (c) of this section.
        (g)  Limit  on  amount  of credit or refund. The amount of overpayment
      determined under  subdivision  (f)  of  this  section  shall,  when  the
      decision  of  the  tax appeals tribunal has become final, be credited or
      refunded in accordance with subdivision (a) of section  11-526  of  this
      chapter  and  shall  not  exceed the amount of tax which the tax appeals
      tribunal determines as part of its decision was paid:
        (1) after the mailing of the notice of deficiency, or
        (2) within the period which would be applicable under subdivision (a),
      (b) or (c) of this section, if on the date of the mailing of the  notice
      of  deficiency a claim has been filed (whether or not filed) stating the
      grounds upon which the tax appeals  tribunal  finds  that  there  is  an
      overpayment.
        (h)  Early  return.  For  purposes  of  this section, any return filed
      before  the  last  day  prescribed  for  the  filing  thereof  shall  be
      considered  as  filed on such last day, determined without regard to any
      extension of time granted the taxpayer.
        (i) Prepaid tax. For purposes of this section, any  tax  paid  by  the
      taxpayer  before  the last day prescribed for its payment and any amount
      paid by the taxpayer as estimated tax for a taxable year shall be deemed
      to have been paid by the taxpayer on the fifteenth  day  of  the  fourth
      month  following  the  close  of his or her taxable year with respect to
      which such amount constitutes a credit or payment.
        (j) Cross reference.  For  provision  barring  refund  of  overpayment
      credited  against  tax  of  a  succeeding  year,  see subdivision (d) of
      section 11-526 of this chapter.
        (k) Notice of change or correction of sales and compensating  use  tax
      liability. If a taxpayer is required by section 11-519.1 of this chapter
      to  file  a report or amended return or report in respect of a change or
      correction of his or her sales and compensating use tax liability, claim
    
      for credit or refund of any resulting overpayment of tax shall be  filed
      by  the  taxpayer  within two years from the time such report or amended
      return or report was required to  be  filed  with  the  commissioner  of
      finance.  The  amount of such credit or refund shall be computed without
      change of the allocation of income upon which the taxpayer's return  (or
      any additional assessment) was based, and shall not exceed the amount of
      the  reduction in tax attributable to such change or correction of sales
      and compensating use tax liability.
        This subdivision shall not affect the time within which or the  amount
      for  which  a  claim  for  credit or refund may be filed apart from this
      subdivision.

Section 11-528 ::    
        
     
        ยง  11-528  Interest  on  overpayment. (a) General. Notwithstanding the
      provisions of section three-a of the  general  municipal  law,  interest
      shall  be allowed and paid as follows at the overpayment rate set by the
      commissioner of finance pursuant to section 11-537 of this chapter,  or,
      if  no  rate  is  set,  at  the  rate  of six percent per annum upon any
      overpayment in respect of the tax imposed by this chapter:
        (1) from the date of the overpayment to the  due  date  of  an  amount
      against which a credit is taken; or
        (2)  from  the  date of the overpayment to a date (to be determined by
      the commissioner of finance) preceding the date of a refund check by not
      more than thirty days, whether or not such refund check is  accepted  by
      the  taxpayer after tender of such check to the taxpayer. The acceptance
      of such check shall be without prejudice to any right of the taxpayer to
      claim any additional overpayment and interest thereon.
        (3) Late  and  amended  returns  and  claims  for  credit  or  refund.
      Notwithstanding paragraph one or two of this subdivision, in the case of
      an  overpayment claimed on a return of tax which is filed after the last
      date prescribed for  filing  such  return  (determined  with  regard  to
      extensions),  or  claimed  on  an  amended return of tax or claimed on a
      claim, for credit or refund, no interest shall be allowed  or  paid  for
      any day before the date on which such return or claim is filed.
        (4)  Interest  on  certain  refunds.  To  the  extent  provided for in
      regulations promulgated by the commissioner of finance, if  an  item  of
      income, gain, loss, deduction or credit is changed from the taxable year
      or period in which it is reported to the taxable year or period in which
      it  belongs  and the change results in an underpayment in a taxable year
      or period and an overpayment in some other taxable year or  period,  the
      provisions  of  paragraph  three  of this subdivision with respect to an
      overpayment shall not be applicable to the extent that the limitation in
      such paragraph on the right to interest would result in a  taxpayer  not
      being  allowed  interest  for  a  length  of  time  with  respect  to an
      overpayment while being required to pay interest on an equivalent amount
      of the related  underpayment.  However,  this  paragraph  shall  not  be
      construed  as  limiting  or  mitigating  the  effect  of  any statute of
      limitations or any other provisions of law relating to the authority  of
      such  commissioner  to issue a notice of deficiency or to allow a credit
      or refund of an overpayment.
        (5) Amounts of less than one dollar. No interest shall be  allowed  or
      paid if the amount thereof is less than one dollar.
        (b)  Advance  payment  of  tax  and  payment  of  estimated  tax.  The
      provisions of subdivisions (h) and (i) of section 11-527 of this chapter
      applicable in determining the date of payment of  tax  for  purposes  of
      determining  the  period  of  limitations  on credit or refund, shall be
      applicable in determining the date  of  payment  for  purposes  of  this
      section.
        (c)  Refund  within  three  months  of  claim  for overpayment. If any
      overpayment of tax imposed by  this  chapter  is  credited  or  refunded
      within  three  months  after  the  last date prescribed (or permitted by
      extension of time) for filing the return  of  such  tax  on  which  such
      overpayment  was  claimed  or  within three months after such return was
      filed, whichever is later, or  within  three  months  after  an  amended
      return  was filed claiming such overpayment or within three months after
      a claim for credit or refund was filed on  which  such  overpayment  was
      claimed,  no  interest  shall  be allowed under this section on any such
      overpayment. For purposes of this subdivision,  any  amended  return  or
      claim  for  credit  or  refund  filed before the last day prescribed (or
      permitted by extension of time) for the filing of the return of tax  for
      such year shall be considered as filed on such last day.
    
        (d)  Refund  of tax caused by carryback. For purposes of this section,
      if any overpayment of  tax  imposed  by  this  chapter  results  from  a
      carryback  of a net operating loss, such overpayment shall be deemed not
      to have been made prior to the filing date for the taxable year in which
      such  net  operating  loss  arises. Such filing date shall be determined
      without  regard  to  extensions  of  time  to  file.  For  purposes   of
      subdivision  (c)  of this section any overpayment described herein shall
      be treated as an overpayment for the  loss  year  and  such  subdivision
      shall be applied with respect to such overpayment by treating the return
      for  the  loss  year  as  not filed before claim for such overpayment is
      filed. The term "loss year" means the taxable year in  which  such  loss
      arises.
        (e)  No interest until return in processible form. (1) For purposes of
      subdivisions (a) and (c) of this section, a return shall not be  treated
      as filed until it is filed in processible form.
        (2)  For purposes of paragraph one of this subdivision, a return is in
      a processible form if:
        (A) such return is filed on a permitted form, and
        (B) such return contains:
        (i) the taxpayer's name,  address,  and  identifying  number  and  the
      required signatures, and
        (ii)  sufficient  required  information  (whether  on the return or on
      required attachments) to permit the  mathematical  verification  of  tax
      liability shown on the return.
        (f)  Cross-reference.  For  provision  with  respect to interest after
      failure to file notice of federal or New York state change under section
      11-519 of this chapter, see subdivision (c) of section  11-527  of  this
      chapter.

      petition to the tax appeals tribunal, and further proceedings before the
      tax appeals tribunal in any case initiated by the filing of a  petition,
      shall  be  governed  by  such  rules  as  the tax appeals tribunal shall
      prescribe. No petition shall be denied  in  whole  or  in  part  without
      opportunity  for  a hearing on reasonable prior notice. Such hearing and
      any appeal to the tribunal sitting en banc from the decision rendered in
      such hearing shall be  conducted  in  the  manner  and  subject  to  the
      requirements prescribed by the tax appeals tribunal pursuant to sections
      one  hundred sixty-eight through one hundred seventy-two of the charter.
      A decision of the tax appeals tribunal shall  be  rendered,  and  notice
      thereof  shall  be  given, in the manner provided by section one hundred
      seventy-one of the charter.
        (b) Petition for redetermination of a deficiency. Within ninety  days,
      or one hundred fifty days if the notice is addressed to a person outside
      of  the  United  States,  after  the mailing of the notice of deficiency
      authorized by section 11-521 of this chapter, or if the commissioner  of
      finance  has  established  a  conciliation procedure pursuant to section
      11-124 of the  code  and  the  taxpayer  has  requested  a  conciliation
      conference  in accordance therewith, within ninety days from the mailing
      of  the  conciliation  decision  or  the  date  of  the   commissioner's
      confirmation  of  the discontinuance of the conciliation proceeding, the
      taxpayer may file a  petition  with  the  tax  appeals  tribunal  for  a
      redetermination of the deficiency. Such petition may also assert a claim
      for  refund  for  the  same  taxable  year  or  years,  subject  to  the
      limitations of subdivision (g) of section 11-527 of this chapter.
        (c) Petition for refund. A taxpayer may file a petition with  the  tax
      appeals tribunal for the amounts asserted in a claim for refund if:
        (1)  the  taxpayer  has  filed  a  timely  claim  for  refund with the
      commissioner of finance,
        (2) the taxpayer  has  not  previously  filed  with  the  tax  appeals
      tribunal a timely petition under subdivision (b) of this section for the
      same  taxable year unless the petition under this subdivision relates to
      a separate claim for credit or refund properly filed  under  subdivision
      (f) of section 11-527 of this chapter, and
        (3)  either: (A) six months have expired since the claim was filed, or
      (B)  the  commissioner  of  finance  has  mailed  to  the  taxpayer,  by
      registered  or certified mail, a notice of disallowance of such claim in
      whole or in part. No petition under this subdivision shall be filed more
      than two years after the date of mailing of a  notice  of  disallowance,
      unless  prior  to  the  expiration  of  such two year period it has been
      extended by written agreement between the taxpayer and the  commissioner
      of finance. If a taxpayer files a written waiver of the requirement that
      he  or  she  be  mailed  a  notice  of disallowance, the two year period
      prescribed by this subdivision for filing a petition  for  refund  shall
      begin on the date such waiver is filed.
        (4)  If  the  commissioner  of  finance has established a conciliation
      procedure pursuant to section 11-124 of the  code,  a  taxpayer  who  is
      eligible  to  file  a  petition for refund with the tax appeals tribunal
      pursuant to this subdivision may request a conciliation conference prior
      to filing such petition, provided the request is made  within  the  time
      prescribed  for  filing  the  petition. Notwithstanding anything in this
      subdivision  to  the  contrary,  if  the  taxpayer   has   requested   a
      conciliation  conference  in  accordance  with the procedure established
      pursuant to section 11-124 of the code, a petition  for  refund  may  be
      filed  no  later  than  ninety days from the mailing of the conciliation
      decision  or  the  date  of  the  commissioner's  confirmation  of   the
      discontinuance of the conciliation proceeding.
    
        (d)  Assertion  of  deficiency after filing petition. (1) Petition for
      redetermination of deficiency. If a taxpayer files with the tax  appeals
      tribunal a petition for redetermination of a deficiency, the tax appeals
      tribunal  shall  have  power  to  determine  a  greater  deficiency than
      asserted in the notice of deficiency and to determine if there should be
      assessed  any  addition  to tax or penalty provided in section 11-525 of
      this chapter, if claim therefor is asserted at  or  before  the  hearing
      under the rules of the tax appeals tribunal.
        (2)  Petition  for  refund. If the taxpayer files with the tax appeals
      tribunal a petition for credit or refund for a  taxable  year,  the  tax
      appeals tribunal may:
        (A)  determine  a  deficiency  for  such  year  as  to  any  amount of
      deficiency asserted at or before the hearing  under  rules  of  the  tax
      appeals  tribunal, and within the period in which an assessment would be
      timely under section 11-523 of this chapter, or
        (B) deny so much of the amount for which credit or refund is sought in
      the petition, as is offset  by  other  issues  pertaining  to  the  same
      taxable  year which are asserted at or before the hearing under rules of
      the tax appeals tribunal.
        (3) Opportunity to respond. A taxpayer shall  be  given  a  reasonable
      opportunity  to  respond  to any matters asserted by the commissioner of
      finance under this subdivision.
        (4) Restriction on further notices  of  deficiency.  If  the  taxpayer
      files  a  petition  with the tax appeals tribunal under this section, no
      notice of deficiency under section 11-521 of this chapter may thereafter
      be issued by the commissioner of finance  for  the  same  taxable  year,
      except  in  case  of  fraud or with respect to a change or correction in
      federal or New York state taxable income required to be  reported  under
      section  11-519  of  this  chapter  or with respect to a state change or
      correction of sales and compensating use tax liability  to  be  reported
      under section 11-519.1 of this chapter.
        (e) Burden of proof. In any case before the tax appeals tribunal under
      this  chapter,  the  burden of proof shall be upon the petitioner except
      for the following issues, as to which the burden of proof shall be  upon
      the commissioner of finance:
        (1)  whether  the  petitioner  has been guilty of fraud with intent to
      evade tax;
        (2) whether the petitioner is liable as the transferee of property  of
      a taxpayer, but not to show that the taxpayer was liable for the tax;
        (3)  whether the petitioner is liable for any increase in a deficiency
      where such increase is asserted initially after a notice  of  deficiency
      was mailed and a petition under this section filed, unless such increase
      in  deficiency is the result of a change or correction of federal or New
      York state taxable income required to be reported under  section  11-519
      of  this  chapter, and of which change or correction the commissioner of
      finance had no notice at the  time  he  or  she  mailed  the  notice  of
      deficiency  or  unless  such  increase  in deficiency is the result of a
      change or  correction  of  sales  and  compensating  use  tax  liability
      required  to  be reported under section 11-519.1 of this chapter, and of
      which change or correction the commissioner of finance had no notice  at
      the time he or she mailed the notice of deficiency; and
        (4)  whether  any person is liable for a penalty under subdivision (k)
      of section 11-525.
        (f) Evidence of related federal or state determination. Evidence of  a
      federal  or  state  determination  relating  to  issues raised in a case
      before the tax appeals tribunal under this section shall be  admissible,
      under rules established by the tax appeals tribunal.
    
        (g)  Jurisdiction  over  other  years.  The tax appeals tribunal shall
      consider such facts with relation to the taxes for other years as may be
      necessary correctly to determine the tax for the taxable year, but in so
      doing shall have no jurisdiction to determine whether or not the tax for
      any other year has been overpaid or underpaid.

Section 11-530 ::    
        
     
        ยง  11-530  Review  of  tax appeals tribunal's decision. (a) General. A
      decision of the tax appeals tribunal sitting en banc shall be subject to
      judicial review at the instance of any taxpayer affected thereby in  the
      manner  provided  by law for the review of a final decision or action of
      administrative agencies of the city. An application by  a  taxpayer  for
      such review must be made within four months after notice of the decision
      is sent by certified mail, return receipt requested, to the taxpayer and
      the commissioner of finance.
        (b)  Judicial review exclusive remedy. The review of a decision of the
      tax appeals tribunal provided by this section  shall  be  the  exclusive
      remedy  available  to any taxpayer for the judicial determination of the
      liability of the taxpayer for the taxes imposed by this chapter.
        (c) Assessment  pending  review;  review  bond.  Irrespective  of  any
      restrictions  on  the  assessment  and  collection  of deficiencies, the
      commissioner of finance may assess a deficiency determined  by  the  tax
      appeals  tribunal in a decision rendered pursuant to section one hundred
      seventy-one of the charter after the expiration of the period  specified
      in  subdivision (a) of this section, notwithstanding that an application
      for judicial review in respect of such deficiency has been duly made  by
      the  taxpayer,  unless  the  taxpayer,  at or before the time his or her
      application for review is made, has paid the deficiency,  has  deposited
      with  the  commissioner  of finance the amount of the deficiency, or has
      filed with the commissioner of finance a bond (which may be  a  jeopardy
      bond  under  subdivision  (h)  of section 11-534 of this chapter) in the
      amount of the portion of the deficiency (including  interest  and  other
      amounts)  in respect of which the application for review is made and all
      costs and  charges  which  may  accrue  against  such  taxpayer  in  the
      prosecution  of the proceeding, including costs of all appeals, and with
      surety approved by a justice of the supreme court of the  state  of  New
      York,   conditioned  upon  the  payment  of  the  deficiency  (including
      interests and other amounts) as finally determined and  such  costs  and
      charges.  If,  as  a  result  of  a  waiver  of  the restrictions on the
      assessment and collection of  a  deficiency,  any  part  of  the  amount
      determined  by  the tax appeals tribunal is paid after the filing of the
      review bond, such bond  shall,  at  the  request  of  the  taxpayer,  be
      proportionately reduced.
        (d)  Credit,  refund  or  abatement  after  review. If the amount of a
      deficiency determined by the tax appeals tribunal is disallowed in whole
      or in part by the court of review, the amount  so  disallowed  shall  be
      credited,  or  refunded  to  the  taxpayer,  without the making of claim
      therefor, or, if payment has not been made, shall be abated.
        (e) Date of finality of tax appeals tribunal's decision. A decision of
      the tax appeals tribunal shall become final upon the expiration  of  the
      period  specified  in  subdivision  (a)  of  this  section for making an
      application for review, if no such application has been duly made within
      such time, or if such application has been duly made, upon expiration of
      the time for all further judicial review, or upon the rendering  by  the
      tax appeals tribunal of a decision in accordance with the mandate of the
      court  on  review.  Notwithstanding  the  foregoing,  for the purpose of
      making an application for  review,  the  decision  of  the  tax  appeals
      tribunal  shall  be  deemed  final on the date the notice of decision is
      sent by certified mail to the taxpayer and the commissioner of finance.

      (1) If any return,  declaration  of  estimated  tax,  claim,  statement,
      notice, petition, or other document required to be filed, or any payment
      required  to  be  made,  within  a  prescribed  period or on or before a
      prescribed date under authority of any provision  of  this  chapter  is,
      after  such  period or such date, delivered by the United States mail to
      the commissioner of  finance,  tax  appeals  tribunal,  bureau,  office,
      officer  or  person with which or with whom such document is required to
      be filed, or to which or to whom such payment is required  to  be  made,
      the  date of the United States postmark stamped on the envelope shall be
      deemed to be the date of delivery. This subdivision shall apply only  if
      the postmark date falls within the prescribed period or on or before the
      prescribed  date  for  the  filing  of  such document, or for making the
      payment, including any extension granted for such filing or payment, and
      only if such document or payment was  deposited  in  the  mail,  postage
      prepaid,  properly addressed to the commissioner of finance, tax appeals
      tribunal, bureau, office, officer or person with which or with whom  the
      document  is required to be filed or to which or to whom such payment is
      required to be made. If any document is sent by United States registered
      mail, such registration shall be prima facie evidence that such document
      was delivered to the commissioner  of  finance,  tax  appeals  tribunal,
      bureau,  office, officer or person to which or to whom addressed. To the
      extent that the commissioner of finance  or,  where  relevant,  the  tax
      appeals  tribunal  shall  prescribe by regulation, certified mail may be
      used in lieu of registered mail under this section. Except  as  provided
      in  paragraph  two  of this subdivision, this subdivision shall apply in
      the case of postmarks not made by the United States postal service  only
      if  and  to  the  extent  provided by regulations of the commissioner of
      finance or, where relevant, the tax appeals tribunal.
        (2) (A) Any reference in paragraph one  of  this  subdivision  to  the
      United  States  mail  shall  be  treated as including a reference to any
      delivery service designated by the secretary  of  the  treasury  of  the
      United  States  pursuant  to  section  seventy-five  hundred  two of the
      internal revenue code  and  any  reference  in  paragraph  one  of  this
      subdivision  to a United States postmark shall be treated as including a
      reference to any date recorded or marked  in  the  manner  described  in
      section  seventy-five  hundred  two  of  the  internal revenue code by a
      designated delivery service. If the commissioner of finance  finds  that
      any  delivery service designated by such secretary is inadequate for the
      needs of the city, the commissioner may withdraw  such  designation  for
      purposes  of  this title. The commissioner may also designate additional
      delivery services meeting the criteria of section  seventy-five  hundred
      two  of  the  internal  revenue  code for purposes of this title, or may
      withdraw any such designation if the commissioner of finance finds  that
      a  delivery  service  so  designated  is inadequate for the needs of the
      city. Any reference in paragraph one of this subdivision to  the  United
      States  mail  shall  be treated as including a reference to any delivery
      service designated by the commissioner of finance and any  reference  in
      paragraph  one  of this subdivision to a United States postmark shall be
      treated as including a reference to any date recorded or marked  in  the
      manner  described  in  section  seventy-five hundred two of the internal
      revenue code by a delivery service designated  by  the  commissioner  of
      finance.    Notwithstanding the foregoing, any withdrawal of designation
      or additional designation by the commissioner of finance  shall  not  be
      effective  for purposes of service upon the tax appeals tribunal, unless
      and until such withdrawal of designation or  additional  designation  is
      ratified by the president of the tax appeals tribunal.
    
        (B)  Any  equivalent of registered or certified mail designated by the
      United States secretary of the treasury, or as may be designated by  the
      commissioner  of  finance  pursuant  to  the  same criteria used by such
      secretary for such designations pursuant to section seventy-five hundred
      two  of  the internal revenue code, shall be included within the meaning
      of registered or certified  mail  as  used  in  paragraph  one  of  this
      subdivision. If the commissioner of finance finds that any equivalent of
      registered  or  certified  mail  designated  by  such  secretary  or the
      commissioner of finance is inadequate for the needs  of  the  city,  the
      commissioner  of  finance  may withdraw such designation for purposes of
      this title. Notwithstanding the foregoing, any withdrawal of designation
      or additional designation by the commissioner of finance  shall  not  be
      effective  for purposes of service upon the tax appeals tribunal, unless
      and until such withdrawal of designation or  additional  designation  is
      ratified by the president of the tax appeals tribunal.
        (b)  Last  known  address.  For purposes of this chapter, a taxpayer's
      last known address shall be given  in  the  last  return  filed  by  the
      taxpayer,  unless subsequently to the filing of such return the taxpayer
      shall have notified the commissioner of finance of a change of address.
        (c) Last day a Saturday, Sunday or legal holiday. When  the  last  day
      prescribed  under  authority of this chapter (including any extension of
      time) for performing any act falls  on  Saturday,  Sunday,  or  a  legal
      holiday  in  the state of New York, the performance of such act shall be
      considered timely if it is performed on the next succeeding day which is
      not a Saturday, Sunday or legal holiday.
        (d) Certificate: unfiled return. For  purposes  of  this  chapter  and
      sections  one hundred sixty-eight through one hundred seventy-two of the
      charter, the certificate of the commissioner of finance  to  the  effect
      that  a tax has not been paid, that a return or declaration of estimated
      tax has not been filed, or that information has not  been  supplied,  as
      required  by or under the provisions of this title, shall be prima facie
      evidence  that  such  tax  has  not  been  paid,  that  such  return  or
      declaration  has  not  been filed, or that such information has not been
      supplied.

Section 11-532 ::    
        
     
        ยง  11-532   Collection, levy and liens. (a) Collection procedures. The
      taxes imposed by this chapter shall be collected by the commissioner  of
      finance,  and  the  commissioner  may establish the mode or time for the
      collection of any amount due it under  this  chapter  if  not  otherwise
      specified.  The  commissioner  of  finance  shall,  upon request, give a
      receipt for any sum collected under this chapter.  The  commissioner  of
      finance may authorize banks or trust companies which are depositories or
      financial  agents  of the city to receive and give a receipt for any tax
      imposed under this chapter in such manner, at such times, and under such
      conditions as  the  commissioner  of  finance  may  prescribe;  and  the
      commissioner of finance shall prescribe the manner, times and conditions
      under which the receipt of such tax by such banks and trust companies is
      to be treated as payment of such tax to the commissioner of finance.
        (b)  Notice  and  demand for tax. The commissioner of finance shall as
      soon as practicable give notice to each person liable for any amount  of
      tax,  addition  to tax, penalty or interest, which has been assessed but
      remains unpaid, stating the amount and demanding payment  thereof.  Such
      notice  shall be left at the dwelling or usual place of business of such
      person or shall be sent by mail to such  person's  last  known  address.
      Except  where  the  commissioner  of  finance determines that collection
      would be jeopardized by delay, if any tax is assessed prior to the  last
      date  (including  any date fixed by extension) prescribed for payment of
      such tax, payment of such tax shall not be  demanded  until  after  such
      date.
        (c)  Issuance of warrant after notice and demand. If any person liable
      under this chapter for the payment of any tax, addition to tax,  penalty
      or  interest  neglects  or  refuses  to pay the same within the ten days
      after  notice  and  demand  herefor  is  given  to  such  person   under
      subdivision  (b) of this section, the commissioner of finance may within
      six years after the date of such assessment issue a warrant directed  to
      the sheriff of any county of the state, or to any officer or employee of
      the  department of finance, commanding such person to levy upon and sell
      such person's real and personal property for the payment of  the  amount
      assessed,  with  the  cost  of executing the warrant, and to return such
      warrant to the commissioner of finance and pay to the  commissioner  the
      money collected by virtue thereof within sixty days after the receipt of
      the warrant. If the commissioner of finance finds that the collection of
      the  tax or other amount is in jeopardy, notice and demand for immediate
      payment of such tax may be made by the commissioner of finance and  upon
      failure  or  refusal to pay such tax or other amount the commissioner of
      finance may issue  a  warrant  without  regard  to  the  ten-day  period
      provided in this subdivision.
        (d) Copy of warrant to be filed and lien to be created. Any sheriff or
      officer or employee who receives a warrant under subdivision (c) of this
      section  shall within five days thereafter file a copy with the clerk of
      the appropriate county. The clerk shall thereupon enter in the  judgment
      docket,  in  the  column  for judgment debtors, the name of the taxpayer
      mentioned in the warrant, and in appropriate columns the  tax  or  other
      amounts  for  which the warrant is issued and the date when such copy is
      filed; and such amount shall thereupon be a binding lien upon the  real,
      personal and other property of the taxpayer.
        (e)  Judgment. When a warrant has been filed with the county clerk the
      commissioner of finance shall, on behalf of the city, be deemed to  have
      obtained judgment against the taxpayer for the tax or other amounts.
        (f)  Execution.  The  sheriff  or  officer or employee shall thereupon
      proceed upon the judgment in all respects, with like effect, and in  the
      same  manner  prescribed  by law in respect to executions issued against
      property upon judgments of a court of record, and  a  sheriff  shall  be
    
      entitled  to  the  same fees for the sheriff's services in executing the
      warrant, to be collected in the same manner. An officer or  employee  of
      the  department of finance may proceed in any county or counties of this
      state  and  shall have all the powers of execution conferred by law upon
      sheriffs, but shall be entitled to no fee or compensation in  excess  of
      actual expenses paid in connection with the execution of the warrant.
        (g)  Taxpayer  not a resident of this state. Where a notice and demand
      under subdivision (b) of  this  section  shall  have  been  given  to  a
      taxpayer who is not then a resident of this state, and it appears to the
      commissioner of finance that it is not practicable to find in this state
      property  of the taxpayer sufficient to pay the entire balance of tax or
      other amount owing by such taxpayer who is not then a resident  of  this
      state,  the  commissioner of finance may, in accordance with subdivision
      (c) of this section, issue a warrant directed to an officer or  employee
      of the department of finance, a copy of which warrant shall be mailed by
      certified  or  registered  mail  to  the taxpayer at the taxpayer's last
      known address, subject to the rules for mailing provided in  subdivision
      (a)  of  section  11-521 of this chapter. Such warrant shall command the
      officer or employee to proceed in New York county, and such  officer  or
      employee  shall, within five days after receipt of the warrant, file the
      warrant and obtain a judgment in accordance with this section. Thereupon
      the commissioner of finance may authorize the institution of any  action
      or proceeding to collect or enforce the judgment in any place and by any
      procedure that a civil judgment of the supreme court of the state of New
      York  could  be  collected  or enforced. The commissioner of finance may
      also, in the  commissioner's  discretion,  designate  agents  or  retain
      counsel  for  the  purpose of collecting, outside the state of New York,
      any unpaid taxes, additions to tax, penalties  or  interest  which  have
      been assessed under this chapter against taxpayers who are not residents
      of this state, may fix the compensation of such agents and counsel to be
      paid  out  of  money  appropriated  or  otherwise lawfully available for
      payment thereof, and may require of them bonds or other security for the
      faithful performance of their duties, in such form and in such amount as
      the commissioner of finance shall deem proper and sufficient.
        (h) Action by city for recovery of taxes. Action may be brought by the
      corporation counsel of the city at the instance of the  commissioner  of
      finance  as  agent and trustee for the city to recover the amount of any
      unpaid taxes, additions to tax, penalties or interest  which  have  been
      assessed  under  this  chapter  within  six  years prior to the date the
      action is commenced.
        (i) Release of lien or vacating warrant. The commissioner of  finance,
      if  he  or  she finds that the interests of the city will not thereby be
      jeopardized, and upon such conditions as the commissioner  may  require,
      may  release  any  property  from the lien of any warrant or vacate such
      warrant for unpaid taxes, additions to tax, penalties and interest filed
      pursuant to subdivision (d) or (g) of this section, and such release  or
      vacating  of  the warrant may be recorded in the office of any recording
      officer in which such warrant has been filed. The clerk shall  thereupon
      cancel  and  discharge  as of the original date of docketing the vacated
      warrant.

        ยง 11-533 Transferees. (a) General. The liability, at law or in equity,
      of a transferee of property of a taxpayer for any tax, additions to tax,
      penalty  or interest due the commissioner of finance under this chapter,
      shall be assessed, paid, and collected in the same manner and subject to
      the same provisions and limitations as in the case of the tax  to  which
      the  liability  relates,  except  that  the  period  of  limitations for
      assessment against the transferee shall be extended by one year for each
      successive transfer,  in  order,  from  the  original  taxpayer  to  the
      transferee  involved, but not by more than three years in the aggregate.
      The  term  "transferee"  includes  donee,  heir,  legatee,  devisee  and
      distributee.
        (b)  Exceptions.  (1)  If  before  the  expiration  of  the  period of
      limitations for assessment of liability of the transferee, a  claim  has
      been  filed  by  the  commissioner  of  finance in any court against the
      original taxpayer or the  last  preceeding  transferee  based  upon  the
      liability  of  the  original taxpayer, then the period of limitation for
      assessment of liability of the transferee shall in no event expire prior
      to one year after such claim has been  finally  allowed,  disallowed  or
      otherwise disposed of.
        (2)  If,  before  the expiration of the time prescribed in subdivision
      (a) of this section or  the  immediately  preceding  paragraph  of  this
      subdivision  for  the  assessment  of the liability, the commissioner of
      finance and the  transferee  have  both  consented  in  writing  to  its
      assessment  after  such  time, the liability may be assessed at any time
      prior to the expiration of the period agreed upon. The period so  agreed
      upon may be extended by subsequent agreements in writing made before the
      expiration  of  the  period  previously  agreed upon. For the purpose of
      determining the  period  of  limitation  on  credit  or  refund  to  the
      transferee   of   overpayments   of  tax  made  by  such  transferee  or
      overpayments of tax made by the transferor as to which the transferee is
      legally entitled to credit or refund, such agreement and  any  extension
      thereof  shall  be deemed an agreement and extension thereof referred to
      in subdivision (b) of section 11-527 of this chapter. If  the  agreement
      is  executed  after  the  expiration  of  the  period  of limitation for
      assessment  against  the  original  taxpayer,  then  in   applying   the
      limitations  under  subdivision (b) of section 11-527 of this chapter on
      the amount of the credit or refund, the periods specified in subdivision
      (a) of section 11-527 of this chapter shall be increased by  the  period
      from the date of such expiration to the date of agreement.
        (c)  Deceased  transferor.  If  any  person is deceased, the period of
      limitation for assessment against such person shall be the  period  that
      would be in effect if such person had lived.
        (d)  Evidence.  Notwithstanding  the  provisions of subdivision (e) of
      section 11-537 of this chapter the commissioner of finance shall use his
      or her powers to make available to the transferee evidence necessary  to
      enable  the  transferee  to  determine  the  liability  of  the original
      taxpayer and of any preceding transferees, but without undue hardship to
      the original taxpayer or preceding transferee. See  subdivision  (e)  of
      section 11-529 of this chapter for rules as to burden of proof.

Section 11-534 ::    
        
     
        ยง  11-534  Jeopardy  assessment.  (a)  Authority  for  making.  If the
      commissioner of finance believes that the assessment or collection of  a
      deficiency  will  be  jeopardized  by  delay,  the  commissioner  shall,
      notwithstanding the provision of sections  11-521  and  11-536  of  this
      chapter,  and  immediately  assess  such  deficiency  (together with all
      interest, penalties and additions to  tax  provided  for  by  law),  and
      notice  and  demand shall be made by the commissioner of finance for the
      payment thereof.
        (b) Notice of deficiency. If the jeopardy assessment  is  made  before
      any  notice  in  respect  to  the  tax  to which the jeopardy assessment
      relates has been mailed under section 11-521 of this chapter,  then  the
      commissioner  of  finance  shall mail a notice under such section within
      sixty days after the making of the assessment.
        (c) Amount assessable before decision of  tax  appeals  tribunal.  The
      jeopardy  assessment  may  be made in respect of a deficiency greater or
      less than that of which notice is mailed to the taxpayer and whether  or
      not  the  taxpayer  has heretofore filed a petition with the tax appeals
      tribunal. The commissioner of finance may, at any time  before  the  tax
      appeals  tribunal  renders  its  decision, abate such assessment, or any
      unpaid portion thereof, to the extent that the commissioner believes the
      assessment to be excessive in amount. The tax appeals  tribunal  may  in
      its  decision redetermine the entire amount of the deficiency and of all
      amounts assessed at the same time in connection therewith.
        (d) Amount assessable after decision of tax appeals tribunal.  If  the
      jeopardy  assessment  is  made  after  the  decision  of the tax appeals
      tribunal is rendered, such assessment may be made only in respect of the
      deficiency determined by the tax appeals tribunal in its decision.
        (e) Expiration of right to assess. A jeopardy assessment  may  not  be
      made  after the decision of the tax appeals tribunal has become final or
      after the taxpayer has made an application for review of the decision of
      the tax appeals tribunal.
        (f) Collection of unpaid amounts. When a petition has been filed  with
      the  tax  appeals  tribunal  and  when the amount which should have been
      assessed has been determined by a decision of the tax  appeals  tribunal
      which has become final, then any unpaid portion, the collection of which
      has  been  stayed  by  bond,  shall be collected as part of the tax upon
      notice and demand from the commissioner of finance,  and  any  remaining
      portion  of  the  assessment  shall  be  abated.  If  the amount already
      collected exceeds the amount determined as the amount which should  have
      been assessed, such excess shall be credited or refunded to the taxpayer
      as  provided  in  section  11-526  of this chapter without the filing of
      claim therefor. If the amount determined as the amount which should have
      been assessed is greater than the amount  actually  assessed,  then  the
      difference  shall  be assessed and shall be collected as part of the tax
      upon notice and demand from the commissioner of finance.
        (g) Abatement if jeopardy does not exist. The commissioner of  finance
      may  abate  the  jeopardy  assessment  if  the  commissioner  finds that
      jeopardy does not exist. Such abatement may not be made after a decision
      of the tax appeals tribunal  in  respect  of  the  deficiency  has  been
      rendered  or,  if  no  petition  is filed with the tax appeals tribunal,
      after the expiration of the period for filing such petition. The  period
      of  limitation on the making of assessments and levy or a proceeding for
      collection, in respect of any deficiency, shall be determined as if  the
      jeopardy assessment so abated had not been made, except that the running
      of  such  period shall in any event be suspended for the period from the
      date of such jeopardy assessment until the expiration of the  tenth  day
      after the day on which such jeopardy assessment is abated.
    
        (h) Bond to stay collection. The collection of the whole or any amount
      of any jeopardy assessment may be stayed by filing with the commissioner
      of finance, within such time as may be fixed by regulation, a bond in an
      amount  equal to the amount as to which the stay is desired, conditioned
      upon  the  payment  of  the  amount (together with interest thereon) the
      collection of which is stayed at the time at which, but for  the  making
      of the jeopardy assessment, such amount would be due. Upon the filing of
      the  bond the collection of so much of the amount assessed as is covered
      by the bond shall be stayed. The taxpayer shall have the right to  waive
      such  stay at any time in respect of the whole or any part of the amount
      covered by the bond, and if as a result of such waiver any part  of  the
      amount  covered  by the bond is paid, then the bond shall at the request
      of the taxpayer, be proportionately  reduced.  If  any  portion  of  the
      jeopardy  assessment  is  abated,  or  if  a  notice or deficiency under
      section 11-521 of this chapter is mailed to the  taxpayer  in  a  lesser
      amount,   the   bond   shall,   at  the  request  of  the  taxpayer,  be
      proportionately reduced.
        (i) Petition to tax appeals tribunal. If the bond is given before  the
      taxpayer  has  filed  his  or  her petition under section 11-529 of this
      chapter, the bond shall contain a further condition that if  a  petition
      is not filed within the period provided in such section, then the amount
      the  collection  of  which is stayed by the bond, will be paid on notice
      and demand at any time after the expiration  of  such  period,  together
      with interest thereon from the date of the jeopardy notice and demand to
      the  date of notice and demand under this subdivision. The bond shall be
      conditioned upon the payment of so much of such  assessment  (collection
      of  which  is  stayed by the bond) as is not abated by a decision of the
      tax appeals tribunal which has become final. If the tax appeals tribunal
      determines that the amount assessed is greater  than  the  amount  which
      should  have  been  assessed, then the bond shall, at the request of the
      taxpayer, be proportionately  reduced  when  the  decision  of  the  tax
      appeals tribunal is rendered.
        (j)  Stay  of  sale  of  seized  property pending tax appeals tribunal
      decision. Where a jeopardy assessment is made, the property  seized  for
      the collection of the tax shall not be sold:
        (1)  if  subdivision  (b)  of this section is applicable, prior to the
      issuance of the notice of deficiency and  the  expiration  of  the  time
      provided  in  section  11-529 of this chapter for filing a petition with
      the tax appeals tribunal, and
        (2) if a petition is filed with  the  tax  appeals  tribunal  (whether
      before  or  after  the making of such jeopardy assessment), prior to the
      expiration of the period during which the assessment of  the  deficiency
      would  be  prohibited  if  subdivision  (a)  of  this  section  were not
      applicable.
        Such property may be sold if the taxpayer consents to the sale, or  if
      the commissioner of finance determines that the expenses of conservation
      and maintenance will greatly reduce the net proceeds, or if the property
      is perishable.
        (k)  Interest. For the purpose of subdivision (a) of section 11-524 of
      this chapter, the last date prescribed for payment shall  be  determined
      without  regard  to  any notice and demand for payment issued under this
      section prior to the last date otherwise prescribed for such payment.
        (l) Early termination of taxable year. If the commissioner of  finance
      finds  that  a  taxpayer designs quickly to depart from this state or to
      remove his or her property therefrom, or to conceal himself  or  herself
      or  his  or  her  property  therein,  or  to do any other act tending to
      prejudice or to render  wholly  or  partly  ineffectual  proceedings  to
      collect  the  income  tax  for the current or the preceding taxable year
    
      unless such proceedings be brought without delay,  the  commissioner  of
      finance  shall  declare the taxable period for such taxpayer immediately
      terminated, and shall cause notice of such finding and declaration to be
      given  to  the taxpayer, together with a demand for immediate payment of
      the tax for the taxable period so declared terminated and of the tax for
      the preceding taxable year or so much of such tax as is unpaid,  whether
      or  not  the  time otherwise allowed by law for filing return and paying
      the tax has expired; and such taxes shall thereupon  become  immediately
      due  and  payable. In any proceeding brought to enforce payment of taxes
      made due and payable by virtue of the provisions  of  this  subdivision,
      the  finding  of  the  commissioner  of finance made as herein provided,
      whether made after notice to the taxpayer  or  not,  shall  be  for  all
      purposes presumptive evidence of jeopardy.
        (m)  Reopening  of  taxable period. Notwithstanding the termination of
      the taxable period of the taxpayer by the  commissioner  of  finance  as
      provided in subdivision (l) of this section, the commissioner of finance
      may  reopen  such  taxable period each time the taxpayer is found by the
      commissioner of finance to have  received  income,  within  the  current
      taxable  year, since the termination of such period. A taxable period so
      terminated by the  commissioner  of  finance  may  be  reopened  by  the
      taxpayer  if  the taxpayer files with the commissioner of finance a true
      and accurate return of taxable income and  credits  allowed  under  this
      chapter  for taxable period, together with such other information as the
      commissioner of finance may by regulations prescribe.
        (n)  Furnishing  of  bond  where  taxable  year  is  closed   by   the
      commissioner  of  finance. Payment of taxes shall not be enforced by any
      proceedings under the provisions of  subdivision  (1)  of  this  section
      prior  to  the  expiration of the time otherwise allowed for paying such
      taxes if the taxpayer furnishes, under  regulations  prescribed  by  the
      commissioner  of  finance, a bond to insure the timely making of returns
      with respect to, and payment of, such taxes  or  any  taxes  under  this
      chapter for prior years.

      zone" at any time during the  period  designated  by  the  president  by
      executive  order  as the period of combatant activities in such zone, or

      area, plus the period of continuous hospitalization  outside  the  state
      attributable  to  such  injury,  and  the  next  one hundred eighty days
      thereafter, shall be disregarded in determining, under this chapter,  in
      respect  of  the  tax  liability  (including  any  interest, penalty, or
      addition to the tax) of such individual:
        (1) Whether any of the following acts was performed  within  the  time

      commissioner of finance.
        (2) The amount of any credit or refund (including interest).
        (b)  Action  taken  before  ascertainment  of  right  to benefits. The
      assessment or collection of the tax imposed by this chapter  or  of  any
      liability  to the commissioner of finance in respect of such tax, or any
      action or proceeding by or on behalf of the commissioner of  finance  in
      connection  therewith,  may  be  made,  taken,  begun,  or prosecuted in
      accordance with law, without regard to the provisions of subdivision (a)
      of this section, unless prior to such assessment, collection, action, or
      proceeding it is ascertained that the person concerned  is  entitled  to

        (c) Members of armed forces dying in action. In the case of any person
      who  dies during an induction period while in active service as a member

      falls  the  date  of  such  person's death, or with respect to any prior
      taxable year ending on or after the first day he or she so served  in  a
      combat  zone,  and no returns shall be required in behalf of such person
      or such person's estate for such year; and the tax for any such  taxable
      year  which  is  unpaid  at  the  date  of  his  or her death, including
      interest, additions to tax and penalties, if any, shall not be  assessed

--------------

Section 11-537 ::    
        
     
        ยง  11-537  General powers of commissioner of finance. (a) General. The
      commissioner of finance shall administer and enforce the tax imposed  by
      this  chapter  and the commissioner is authorized to make such rules and
      regulations, and to require such facts and information to  be  reported,
      as  the commissioner may deem necessary to enforce the provision of this
      chapter; and the  commissioner  may  delegate  his  or  her  powers  and
      functions  under  all parts of this chapter to one of the commissioner's
      deputies  or  to  any  employee  or  employees  of  the   commissioner's
      department.
        (b)  Examination  of  books and witnesses. The commissioner of finance
      for the purpose of ascertaining the correctness of any  return,  or  for
      the purpose of making an estimate of tax of any person, shall have power
      to  examine or to cause to have examined, by any agent or representative
      designated by the commissioner for  that  purpose,  any  books,  papers,
      records or memoranda bearing upon the matters required to be included in
      the  return,  and may require the attendance of the person rendering the
      return or any officer or employee of such person, or the  attendance  of
      any  other  person  having  knowledge  in  the  premises,  and  may take
      testimony and require proof material for the commissioner's information,
      with power to administer oaths to such person or persons.
        (c) Abatement authority. The commissioner of finance, of  his  or  her
      own  motion,  may abate any small unpaid balance of an assessment of tax
      under  this  part,  or  any  liability  in  respect  thereof,   if   the
      commissioner of finance determines under uniform rules prescribed by the
      commissioner that the administration and collection costs involved would
      not  warrant  collection  of  the  amount due. The commissioner may also
      abate, of his or her own motion, the unpaid portion of the assessment of
      any tax or any liability in  respect  thereof,  which  is  excessive  in
      amount,  or is assessed after the expiration of the period of limitation
      properly applicable thereto, or is erroneously or illegally assessed. No
      claim for abatement under this subdivision shall be filed by a taxpayer.
        (d) Special refund authority. Where no questions of fact  or  law  are
      involved  and it appears from the records of the commissioner of finance
      that any moneys have been erroneously or illegally  collected  from  any
      taxpayer or other person, or paid by such taxpayer or other person under
      a  mistake  of  facts,  pursuant  to the provisions of this chapter, the
      commissioner of finance at any time, without regard  to  any  period  of
      limitations,  shall  have  the power, upon making a record of his or her
      reasons therefor in writing, to cause such  moneys  so  paid  and  being
      erroneously and illegally held to be refunded.
        (e)  Cooperation  with the United States, this state and other states.
      Notwithstanding the provisions of section 11-538 of  this  chapter,  the
      commissioner  of finance may permit the secretary of the treasury of the
      United States or the secretary's delegates, or  the  proper  officer  of
      this  or  any  other  state  imposing  an income tax upon the incomes of
      individuals, or the authorized representative of any  such  officer,  to
      inspect  any  return  filed  under  this  chapter or may furnish to such
      officer or his or her authorized representative an abstract of any  such
      return  or  supply  such  officer  with  information  concerning an item
      contained in any such return, or disclosed by any investigation  of  tax
      liability  under  this  chapter, but such permission shall be granted or
      such  information  furnished  to  such   officer   or   such   officer's
      representative  only  if the laws of the United States or of such state,
      as the case may  be,  grant  substantially  similar  privileges  to  the
      commissioner  of  finance  and  such  information  is to be used for tax
      purposes only; and provided further  the  commissioner  of  finance  may
      furnish  to  the  secretary  of the treasury of the United States or the
      secretary's delegates or to the tax commission of the state of New  York
    
      or  its  delegates  such  returns filed under this chapter and other tax
      information, as he or she may consider proper for use in  court  actions
      or  proceedings  under  the  internal revenue code or the tax law of the
      state  of  New  York, whether civil or criminal, where a written request
      therefor has been made to the commissioner of finance by  the  secretary
      of  the  treasury  or  by  such  tax  commission  or by their delegates,
      provided the laws of the United States or the laws of the state  of  New
      York grant substantially similar powers to the secretary of the treasury
      of  the  United  States  or  the  secretary's  delegates  or to such tax
      commission or its delegates. Where the commissioner of  finance  has  so
      authorized  use  of  returns  or  other  information  in such actions or
      proceedings, officers and employees of the  department  of  finance  may
      testify  in  such  actions  or proceedings in respect to such returns or
      other information.
        (f) (1) Authority to set interest rates. The commissioner  of  finance
      shall  set the overpayment and underpayment rates of interest to be paid
      pursuant to sections 11-524, 11-525 and 11-528 of this chapter,  but  if
      no  such  rate or rates of interest are set, such overpayment rate shall
      be deemed to be set at six percent per annum and such underpayment  rate
      shall  be deemed to be set at seven and one-half percent per annum. Such
      overpayment and underpayment rates shall  be  the  rates  prescribed  in
      paragraph  two  of this subdivision, but the underpayment rate shall not
      be less than seven and one-half percent per annum. Any such rates set by
      the commissioner of  finance  shall  apply  to  taxes,  or  any  portion
      thereof,  which remain or become due or overpaid on or after the date on
      which such rates become effective and shall apply only with  respect  to
      interest  computed  or  computable  for  periods  or portions of periods
      occurring in the period during which such rates are in effect.
        (2) General rule. (A) Overpayment rate. The overpayment rate set under
      this subdivision shall be the sum of (i) the federal short-term rate  as
      provided  under  paragraph  three  of  this  subdivision,  plus (ii) two
      percentage points.
        (B)  Underpayment  rate.  The  underpayment  rate   set   under   this
      subdivision  shall  be  the  sum  of  (i) the federal short-term rate as
      provided under paragraph three of  this  subdivision,  plus  (ii)  seven
      percentage points.
        (3) Federal short-term rate. For purposes of this subdivision:
        (A)  The  federal  short-term  rate for any month shall be the federal
      short-term rate  determined  by  the  United  States  secretary  of  the
      treasury  during such month in accordance with subsection (d) of section
      twelve hundred seventy-four of the internal  revenue  code  for  use  in
      connection  with  section  six  thousand  six  hundred twenty-one of the
      internal revenue code. Any such rate shall be  rounded  to  the  nearest
      full  percent  (or,  if a multiple of one-half of one percent, such rate
      shall be increased to the next highest full percent).
        (B) Period during which  rate  applies.  (i)  In  general.  Except  as
      provided  in  clause  (ii)  of this subparagraph, the federal short-term
      rate for the first month in each calendar quarter shall apply during the
      first calendar quarter beginning after such month.
        (ii) Special  rule  for  the  month  of  September,  nineteen  hundred
      eighty-nine.  The  federal  short-term  rate  for  the  month  of April,
      nineteen hundred eighty-nine shall apply with  respect  to  setting  the
      overpayment  and underpayment rates for the month of September, nineteen
      hundred eighty-nine.
        (4) Publication of interest rates. The commissioner of  finance  shall

      or return required under this chapter. The  officers  charged  with  the
      custody of such reports and returns shall not be required to produce any
      of  them  or  evidence  of  anything  contained in them in any action or
      proceeding in any court, except on behalf of the city in  an  action  or

      thereafter  until  the  commissioner  of  finance  orders  them  to   be
      destroyed.
        2.  Any  officer  or  employee  of the city or the state who willfully

      make  payments  on  account  of  estimated  tax  and payment of any tax,
      penalty or interest imposed by this chapter to banks, banking houses  or
      trust  companies  designated  by the commissioner of finance and to file
      declarations of estimated tax and reports and returns with  such  banks,
      banking  houses  or  trust  companies  as  agents of the commissioner of
      finance, in lieu of making any such payment directly to the commissioner

      contrary, if a taxpayer has petitioned  the  tax  appeals  tribunal  for
      administrative  review as provided in section one hundred seventy of the
      charter, the commissioner of finance shall be authorized to  present  to
      the  tribunal  any report or return of such taxpayer, or any information
      contained therein or relating thereto, which may be material or relevant
      to the proceeding before the tribunal. The tax appeals tribunal shall be
      authorized to publish a copy or  a  summary  of  any  decision  rendered
