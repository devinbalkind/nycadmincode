Section 11-2407
---------------

Section 11-2407 ::    
        
     
        §  11-2407  Determination of tax. If a return required by this chapter
      is not filed, or if a return when filed is  incorrect  or  insufficient,
      the  commissioner  shall  determine  the  amount  of  tax  due from such
      information as may be obtainable and, if necessary, may estimate the tax
      on the basis of external indices. Notice of such determination shall  be
      given   to   the  person  liable  for  the  payment  of  the  tax.  Such
      determination shall finally and  irrevocably  fix  the  tax  unless  the
      person  against whom it is assessed, within ninety days after the giving
      of notice of such determination, or, if the commissioner of finance  has
      established  a  conciliation procedure pursuant to section 11-124 of the
      code and  the  taxpayer  has  requested  a  conciliation  conference  in
      accordance   therewith,  within  ninety  days  from  the  mailing  of  a
      conciliation decision or the date of the commissioner's confirmation  of
      the  discontinuance  of  the  conciliation proceeding, both (1) serves a
      petition upon the commissioner of finance and (2) files a petition  with
      the  tax  appeals  tribunal for a hearing, or unless the commissioner of
      his or her own motion shall redetermine the same. Such hearing  and  any
      appeal  to  the  tax  appeals tribunal sitting en banc from the decision
      rendered in such hearing shall be conducted in the manner and subject to
      the requirements prescribed by the  tax  appeals  tribunal  pursuant  to
      sections  one hundred sixty-eight through one hundred seventy-two of the
      charter. After such hearing the tax appeals tribunal shall  give  notice
      of  its  decision  to the person against whom the tax is assessed and to
      the commissioner of finance. A decision  of  the  tax  appeals  tribunal
      sitting   en   banc   shall  be  reviewable  for  error,  illegality  or
      unconstitutionality or any other reason whatsoever by a proceeding under
      article seventy-eight of the civil practice law and rules if application
      therefor is made to the supreme court by the person against whom the tax
      was assessed within four months after the giving of the notice  of  such
      tax  appeals tribunal decision. A proceeding under article seventy-eight
      of the civil practice law  and  rules  shall  not  be  instituted  by  a
      taxpayer  unless:  (a) the amount of any tax sought to be reviewed, with
      penalties and interest thereon, if any, shall be  first  deposited  with
      the  commissioner  and  there  shall  be  filed with the commissioner an
      undertaking issued by a surety company authorized to  transact  business
      in  this  state  and approved by the superintendent of insurance of this
      state as to solvency and responsibility, in such amount as a justice  of
      the  supreme  court shall approve, to the effect that if such proceeding
      be dismissed or the tax confirmed, the taxpayer will pay all  costs  and
      charges which may accrue in the prosecution of the proceedings or (b) at
      the  option of the taxpayer, such undertaking may be in a sum sufficient
      to cover the taxes, interest and penalties stated in such decision, plus
      the costs and charges which may accrue against it in the prosecution  of
      the proceeding, in which event the taxpayer shall not be required to pay
      such  taxes,  interest  or  penalties  as  a  condition precedent to the
      application.
    
    
    
    
    
    
    

Section 11-2408
---------------

Section 11-2408 ::    
        
     
        §  11-2408  Refunds.  a.  In  the manner provided in this section, the
      commissioner shall refund or credit, without interest, any tax,  penalty
      or  interest  erroneously,  illegally or unconstitutionally collected or
      paid, if written application to the commissioner for such  refund  shall
      be  made  within one year from the payment thereof. Whenever a refund or
      credit is made or denied, the commissioner shall state his or her reason
      therefor and give  notice  thereof  to  the  taxpayer  in  writing.  The
      commissioner  may,  in  lieu  of  any  refund required to be made, allow
      credit therefor on payments due from the applicant.
        b. Any determination of the commissioner of finance denying  a  refund
      or  credit  pursuant to subdivision a of this section shall be final and
      irrevocable unless the applicant  for  such  refund  or  credit,  within
      ninety days from the mailing of notice of such determination, or, if the
      commissioner   of  finance  has  established  a  conciliation  procedure
      pursuant  to  section  11-124  and  the  applicant   has   requested   a
      conciliation conference in accordance therewith, within ninety days from
      the mailing of a conciliation decision or the date of the commissioner's
      confirmation  of the discontinuance of the conciliation proceeding, both
      (1) serves a petition upon the commissioner of finance and (2)  files  a
      petition  with the tax appeals tribunal for a hearing. Such petition for
      a  refund  or  credit  made  as  herein  provided  shall  be  deemed  an
      application  for  a  revision of any tax, penalty or interest complained
      of. Such hearing and any appeal to the tribunal sitting en banc from the
      decision rendered in such hearing shall be conducted in the  manner  and
      subject  to  the  requirements  prescribed  by  the tax appeals tribunal
      pursuant  to  sections  one  hundred  sixty-eight  through  one  hundred
      seventy-two of the charter. After such hearing, the tax appeals tribunal
      shall  give  notice  of  its  decision  to  the  applicant  and  to  the
      commissioner of finance. The applicant shall be entitled to institute  a
      proceeding  pursuant  to article seventy-eight of the civil practice law
      and rules to review a decision of the tax appeals  tribunal  sitting  en
      banc  if  application  to the supreme court be made therefor within four
      months after the giving of notice of such decision, and provided, in the
      case of an application by a taxpayer, that a final determination of  tax
      due  was  not previously made. Such a proceeding shall not be instituted
      by a taxpayer unless an  undertaking  shall  first  be  filed  with  the
      commissioner,  in such amount and with such sureties as a justice of the
      supreme court shall approve, to the effect that if  such  proceeding  be
      dismissed  or  the  tax  confirmed,  the taxpayer will pay all costs and
      charges which may accrue in the prosecution of the proceeding.
        c. A person shall not be entitled to  a  revision,  refund  or  credit
      under  this  section,  of  a  tax,  interest  or  penalty which had been
      determined to be due pursuant to the provisions of  section  11-2407  of
      this chapter where such person has had a hearing or an opportunity for a
      hearing,  as  provided in said section or has failed to avail himself or
      herself of the remedies therein provided. No refund or credit  shall  be
      made  of  a  tax,  interest or penalty paid after a determination by the
      commissioner made pursuant to section 11-2407 of this chapter unless  it
      be   found   that   such   determination   was   erroneous,  illegal  or
      unconstitutional or otherwise improper,  by  the  tax  appeals  tribunal
      after  a  hearing  or  of the commissioner's own motion, or, if such tax
      appeals tribunal affirms in whole or in part the  determination  of  the
      commissioner  of finance, in a proceeding under article seventy-eight of
      the civil practice law and rules, pursuant to  the  provisions  of  said
      section  in  which event refund or credit without interest shall be made
      of the tax, interest or penalty found to have been overpaid.
    
    
    
    
    
    
    

Section 11-2409
---------------

Section 11-2409 ::    
        
     
        §  11-2409  Remedies  exclusive. The remedies provided by this chapter
      shall be the exclusive remedies available to any person for  the  review
      of  tax  liability  imposed  by  this  chapter;  and no determination or
      proposed determination of tax or determination on  any  application  for
      refund  by  the  commissioner  of  finance,  nor any decision by the tax
      appeals tribunal or any of  its  administrative  law  judges,  shall  be
      enjoined  or  reviewed  by an action for declaratory judgment, an action
      for money had and received or by any action or proceeding other than, in
      the case of a decision by the tax appeals tribunal sitting  en  banc,  a
      proceeding  under  article  seventy-eight  of the civil practice law and
      rules; provided, however, that a taxpayer  may  proceed  by  declaratory
      judgment  if  such  taxpayer  institutes suit within thirty days after a
      deficiency assessment is made and pays  the  amount  of  the  deficiency
      assessment to the commissioner prior to the institution of such suit and
      posts a bond for costs as provided in section 11-2407 of this chapter.
    
    
    
    
    
    
    

Section 11-2410
---------------

Section 11-2410 ::    
        
     
        §  11-2410  Reserves.  In  cases  where the taxpayer has applied for a
      refund and has instituted a proceeding under  article  seventy-eight  of
      the  civil  practice  law and rules to review a determination adverse to
      such taxpayer on his or her application for refund, the city comptroller
      shall set up appropriate reserves to meet any decision  adverse  to  the
      city.
    
    
    
    
    
    
    

Section 11-2411
---------------

Section 11-2411 ::    
        
     
        §  11-2411  Proceedings  to  recover tax. a. Whenever any person shall
      fail to pay any tax or penalty or interest imposed by  this  chapter  as
      herein  provided, the corporation counsel shall, upon the request of the
      commissioner, bring or cause to be brought an action to enforce  payment
      of the same against the person liable for the same on behalf of the city
      of  New York in any court of the state of New York or of any other state
      or of the United States. If, however, the commissioner  in  his  or  her
      discretion  believes  that  a taxpayer subject to the provisions of this
      chapter is about to  cease  business,  leave  the  state  or  remove  or
      dissipate  the assets out of which tax or penalties or interest might be
      satisfied and that any such tax or penalty or interest will not be  paid
      when  due,  he  or she may declare such tax or penalty or interest to be
      immediately due and payable and may issue a warrant immediately.
        b. As an additional or alternate remedy, the commission  may  issue  a
      warrant,  directed  to the city sheriff, commanding such sheriff to levy
      upon and sell the real and personal property of such person which may be
      found within the city, for the payment of the amount thereof,  with  any
      penalties  and  interest,  and the cost of executing the warrant, and to
      return such warrant to the commissioner and to pay to  him  or  her  the
      money  collected  by  virtue  thereof within sixty days after receipt of
      such warrant. The city sheriff shall, within five days after the receipt
      of the warrant, file with the county clerk a copy thereof, and thereupon
      such clerk shall enter in the judgment docket the  name  of  the  person
      mentioned  in  the  warrant  and  the  amount  of the tax, penalties and
      interest for which the warrant is issued and the date when such copy  is
      filed.  Thereupon  the amount of such warrant so docketed shall become a
      lien upon the title to and interest in real and personal property of the
      person against whom the warrant is issued. The city sheriff  shall  then
      proceed upon the warrant in the same manner and with like effect as that
      provided  by  law  in respect to executions issued against property upon
      judgments of a court of  record,  and  for  services  in  executing  the
      warrant  such sheriff shall be entitled to the same fees which he or she
      may collect in the same manner. In the discretion of the commissioner  a
      warrant  of  like  terms, force and effect may be issued and directed to
      any officer or employee  of  the  department  of  finance,  and  in  the
      execution  thereof  such  officer  or employee shall have all the powers
      conferred by law upon sheriffs, but he or she shall be  entitled  to  no
      fee  for  compensation  in  excess  of  the  actual expenses paid in the
      performance of such duty. If a warrant  is  returned  not  satisfied  in
      full,  the  commissioner  may  from  time to time issue new warrants and
      shall also have the same remedies to enforce the amount  due  thereunder
      as if the city had recovered judgment therefor and execution thereon had
      been returned unsatisfied.
        c.  Whenever  there  is made a sale, transfer or assignment in bulk of
      any part or the whole of a stock  of  merchandise  or  of  fixtures,  or
      merchandise and of fixtures pertaining to the conducting of the business
      of  the  seller,  transferor or assignor, otherwise than in the ordinary
      course of trade and in the regular prosecution  of  said  business,  the
      purchaser,  transferee or assignee shall at least ten days before taking
      possession of such merchandise, fixtures, or merchandise  and  fixtures,
      or  paying  therefor,  notify the commissioner by registered mail of the
      proposed sale and of the price, terms and conditions thereof whether  or
      not  the seller, transferor or assignor, has represented to, or informed
      the purchaser, transferee or assignee that it owes any tax  pursuant  to
      this  chapter  and  whether or not the purchaser, transferee or assignee
      has knowledge that such taxes are owing, and whether any such taxes  are
      in fact owing.
    
        Whenever  the  purchaser,  transferee  or  assignee shall fail to give
      notice to the commissioner as required by the  preceding  paragraph,  or
      whenever  the  commissioner  shall  inform  the purchaser, transferee or
      assignee that a possible claim for such tax or taxes exists, any sums of
      money,  property  or choses in action, or other consideration, which the
      purchaser, transferee or assignee is required to transfer  over  to  the
      seller,  transferor  or  assignor  shall  be subject to a first priority
      right and lien for any such taxes theretofore or  thereafter  determined
      to  be  due from the seller, transferor or assignor to the city, and the
      purchaser, transferee or  assignee  is  forbidden  to  transfer  to  the
      seller,  transferor  or  assignor  any  such  sums of money, property or
      choses in action to the extent of the amount of the  city's  claim.  For
      failure   to  comply  with  the  provisions  of  this  subdivision,  the
      purchaser, transferee or assignee, in addition to being subject  to  the
      liabilities  and remedies imposed under the provisions of article six of
      the uniform commercial code, shall be personally liable for the  payment
      to the city of any such taxes theretofore or thereafter determined to be
      due  to  the  city  from  the  seller,  transferor or assignor, and such
      liability may be assessed  and  enforced  in  the  same  manner  as  the
      liability for tax under this chapter.
        d.  The commissioner of finance, if he or she finds that the interests
      of the city will not thereby be jeopardized, and upon such conditions as
      the commissioner of finance may require, may release any  property  from
      the  lien  of  any  warrant  or  vacate  such  warrant for unpaid taxes,
      additions to tax, penalties and interest filed pursuant to subdivision b
      of this section, and such release or vacating  of  the  warrant  may  be
      recorded  in  the  office of any recording officer in which such warrant
      has been filed. The clerk shall thereupon cancel and discharge as of the
      original date of docketing the vacated warrant.

Section 11-2414 ::    
        
     
        §  11-2414  Interest  and penalties. (a) Interest on underpayments. If
      any amount of tax is not paid on or before the last date prescribed  for
      payment  (without  regard to any extension of time granted for payment),
      interest on such amount at the rate set by the commissioner  of  finance
      pursuant  to  subdivision (g) of this section, or, if no rate is set, at
      the rate of seven and one-half percent per annum, shall be paid for  the
      period  from  such  last  date  to the date of payment. In computing the
      amount of interest to be paid, such interest shall be compounded  daily.
      Interest  under this subdivision shall not be paid if the amount thereof
      is less than one dollar.
        (b) * (1) Failure to file return. (A) In case of  failure  to  file  a
      return  under  this chapter on or before the prescribed date (determined
      with regard to any extension of time for filing),  unless  it  is  shown
      that  such  failure  is  due  to reasonable cause and not due to willful
      neglect, there shall be added to the amount required to be shown as  tax
      on  such return five percent of the amount of such tax if the failure is
      for not more than one month, with an additional five  percent  for  each
      additional   month   or  fraction  thereof  during  which  such  failure
      continues, not exceeding twenty-five percent in the aggregate.
        (B) In the case of a failure to file a return of tax within sixty days
      of the date prescribed for filing of such return (determined with regard
      to any extension of time for filing),  unless  it  is  shown  that  such
      failure  is  due to reasonable cause and not due to willful neglect, the
      addition to tax under subparagraph (A) of this paragraph  shall  not  be
      less  than  the  lesser of one hundred dollars or one hundred percent of
      the amount required to be shown as tax on such return.
        (C) For purposes of this paragraph, the amount of tax required  to  be
      shown  on  the  return shall be reduced by the amount of any part of the
      tax which is paid on or before the date prescribed for  payment  of  the
      tax and by the amount of any credit against the tax which may be claimed
      upon the return.
        * NB Amended Ch. 765/85 § 41, language juxtaposed per Ch. 907/85 § 14
        (2)  Failure to pay tax shown on return. In case of failure to pay the
      amount shown as tax on a return required to be filed under this  chapter
      on  or  before  the  prescribed  date  (determined  with  regard  to any
      extension of time for payment), unless it is shown that such failure  is
      due  to  reasonable cause and not due to willful neglect, there shall be
      added to the amount shown as tax on such return one-half of one  percent
      of the amount of such tax if the failure is not for more than one month,
      with  an additional one-half of one percent for each additional month or
      fraction thereof during which  such  failure  continues,  not  exceeding
      twenty-five  percent  in the aggregate. For the purpose of computing the
      addition for any month the amount of tax shown on the  return  shall  be
      reduced  by the amount of any part of the tax which is paid on or before
      the beginning of such month and by the amount of any credit against  the
      tax  which may be claimed upon the return. If the amount of tax required
      to be shown on a return is less than the amount shown  as  tax  on  such
      return,  this  paragraph  shall  be  applied  by substituting such lower
      amount.
        (3) Failure to pay tax required to be shown  on  return.  In  case  of
      failure  to pay any amount in respect of any tax required to be shown on
      a return required to be filed under this chapter which is not  so  shown
      (including  a  determination  made  pursuant  to section 11-2407 of this
      chapter) within ten days of the date of a notice  and  demand  therefor,
      unless  it is shown that such failure is due to reasonable cause and not
      due to willful neglect, there shall be added to the amount of tax stated
      in such notice and demand one-half of one percent of  such  tax  if  the
      failure  is  not for more than one month, with an additional one-half of
    
      one percent for each additional month or fraction thereof  during  which
      such  failure  continues,  not  exceeding  twenty-five  percent  in  the
      aggregate. For the purpose of computing the addition for any month,  the
      amount  of  tax  stated in the notice and demand shall be reduced by the
      amount of any part of the tax which is paid before the beginning of such
      month.
        * (4) Limitations on additions.
        (A) With respect to any  return  the  amount  of  the  addition  under
      paragraph  one of this subdivision shall be reduced by the amount of the
      addition under paragraph two of this subdivision for any month to  which
      an  addition  applies  under  both  paragraphs  one and two. In any case
      described in subparagraph (B) of paragraph one of this subdivision,  the
      amount  of  the  addition  under such paragraph one shall not be reduced
      below the amount provided in such subparagraph.
        (B) With respect to any return, the maximum  amount  of  the  addition
      permitted  under paragraph three of this subdivision shall be reduced by
      the amount of the addition  under  paragraph  one  of  this  subdivision
      (determined  without  regard  to subparagraph (B) of such paragraph one)
      which is attributable to the tax for which the notice and demand is made
      and which is not paid within ten days of such notice and demand.
        * NB Amended Ch. 765/85 § 41, language juxtaposed per Ch. 907/85 § 14
        * (c)  Underpayment  due  to  negligence.  (1)  If  any  part  of   an
      underpayment  of  tax  is  due to negligence or intentional disregard of
      this chapter or any rules or regulations hereunder (but  without  intent
      to  defraud),  there  shall  be added to the tax a penalty equal to five
      percent of the underpayment.
        (2) There shall be added  to  the  tax  (in  addition  to  the  amount
      determined  under  paragraph one of this subdivision) an amount equal to
      fifty percent of the interest payable  under  subdivision  (a)  of  this
      section  with  respect  to  the portion of the underpayment described in
      such  paragraph  one  which  is  attributable  to  the   negligence   or
      intentional  disregard referred to in such paragraph one, for the period
      beginning on the last  date  prescribed  by  law  for  payment  of  such
      underpayment  (determined without regard to any extension) and ending on
      the date of the assessment of the tax (or, if earlier, the date  of  the
      payment of the tax).
        * NB Amended Ch. 765/85 § 41, language juxtaposed per Ch. 907/85 § 14
        * (d) Underpayment due to fraud. (1) If any part of an underpayment of
      tax  is due to fraud, there shall be added to the tax a penalty equal to
      fifty percent of the underpayment.
        (2) There shall be added to  the  tax  (in  addition  to  the  penalty
      determined  under  paragraph one of this subdivision) an amount equal to
      fifty percent of the interest payable  under  subdivision  (a)  of  this
      section  with  respect  to  the portion of the underpayment described in
      such paragraph one which  is  attributable  to  fraud,  for  the  period
      beginning  on  the  last  day  prescribed  by  law  for  payment of such
      underpayment (determined without regard to any extension) and ending  on
      the  date  of the assessment of the tax (or, if earlier, the date of the
      payment of the tax).
        (3) The penalty under this subdivision shall be in lieu of  any  other
      addition to tax imposed by subdivision (b) or (c) of this section.
        * NB Amended Ch. 765/85 § 41, language juxtaposed per Ch. 907/85 § 14
        (e)  Additional penalty. Any person who, with fraudulent intent, shall
      fail to pay any tax imposed by this chapter, or to make, render, sign or
      certify any return,  or  to  supply  any  information  within  the  time
      required  by or under this chapter, shall be liable for a penalty of not
      more than one  thousand  dollars,  in  addition  to  any  other  amounts
      required under this chapter to be imposed, assessed and collected by the
    
      commissioner  of  finance.  The  commissioner  of finance shall have the
      power, in his or her discretion, to  waive,  reduce  or  compromise  any
      penalty under this subdivision.
        (f)  The  interest and penalties imposed by this section shall be paid
      and disposed of in the same manner as other revenues from this  chapter.
      Unpaid  interest and penalties may be enforced in the same manner as the
      tax imposed by this chapter.
        (g) (1) Authority to set interest rates. The commissioner  of  finance
      shall set the rate of interest to be paid pursuant to subdivision (a) of
      this section, but if no such rate of interest is set, such rate shall be
      deemed  to  be  set  at  seven and one-half percent per annum. Such rate
      shall be the rate prescribed in paragraph two of  this  subdivision  but
      shall  not  be  less than seven and one-half percent per annum. Any such
      rate set by the commissioner of finance shall apply  to  taxes,  or  any
      portion  thereof,  which  remain  or  become due on or after the date on
      which such rate becomes effective and shall apply only with  respect  to
      interest  computed  or  computable  for  periods  or portions of periods
      occurring in the period in which such rate is in effect.
        (2) General rule. The rate of  interest  set  under  this  subdivision
      shall  be  the  sum of (i) the federal short-term rate as provided under
      paragraph three of this subdivision, plus (ii) seven percentage points.
        (3) Federal short-term rate. For purposes of this subdivision:
        (A) The federal short-term rate for any month  shall  be  the  federal
      short-term  rate  determined  by  the  United  States  secretary  of the
      treasury during such month in accordance with subsection (d) of  section
      twelve  hundred  seventy-four  of  the  internal revenue code for use in
      connection with section six  thousand  six  hundred  twenty-one  of  the
      internal  revenue  code.  Any  such rate shall be rounded to the nearest
      full percent (or, if a multiple of one-half of one  percent,  such  rate
      shall be increased to the next highest full percent).
        (B) Period during which rate applies.
        (i)   In   general.   Except  as  provided  in  clause  (ii)  of  this
      subparagraph, the federal short-term rate for the first  month  in  each
      calendar quarter shall apply during the first calendar quarter beginning
      after such month.
        (ii)  Special  rule  for  the  month  of  September,  nineteen hundred
      eighty-nine. The  federal  short-term  rate  for  the  month  of  April,
      nineteen  hundred  eighty-nine  shall  apply with respect to setting the
      rate  of  interest  for  the  month  of  September,   nineteen   hundred
      eighty-nine.
        (4)  Publication  of  interest rate. The commissioner of finance shall
      cause to be published in the city record,  and  give  other  appropriate
      general notice of, the interest rate to be set under this subdivision no
      later  than  twenty days preceding the first day of the calendar quarter
      during which such interest rate applies. The setting and publication  of
      such  interest  rate  shall  not  be  included  within  paragraph (a) of
      subdivision five of section one thousand forty-one of the  city  charter
      relating to the definition of a rule.
        * (h)  Miscellaneous.  (1)  The  certificate  of  the  commissioner of
      finance to the effect that a tax has not been paid, that  a  return  has
      not  been  filed, that information has not been supplied pursuant to the
      provisions of this chapter  or  that  records  have  not  been  retained
      pursuant to the provisions of this chapter shall be prima facie evidence
      thereof.

Section 11-2415 ::    
        
     
        §  11-2415  Returns  to be secret. a. Except in accordance with proper
      judicial order, or as otherwise provided by law, it  shall  be  unlawful
      for  the  commissioner,  the  tax  appeals  tribunal  or  any officer or
      employee of the city  to  divulge  or  make  known  in  any  manner  any
      information  relating  to  the  business  of a taxpayer contained in any
      return required under  this  chapter.  The  officers  charged  with  the
      custody  of such returns shall not be required to produce any of them or
      evidence of anything contained in them in any action  or  proceeding  in
      any  court,  except  on  behalf  of  the  commissioner  in  an action or
      proceeding under the provisions of this chapter, or  on  behalf  of  any
      party  to  any action or proceeding under the provisions of this chapter
      when the returns or facts shown thereby are directly  involved  in  such
      action  or  proceeding,  in either of which events the court may require
      the production of, and may admit in evidence, so much of said returns or
      of the facts shown thereby, as are pertinent to the action or proceeding
      and no more. Nothing herein shall be construed to prohibit the  delivery
      to  a  taxpayer  or  the  taxpayer's duly authorized representative of a
      certified copy of any return filed in connection with his or her tax nor
      to prohibit the publication of statistics so classified  as  to  prevent
      the  identification  of particular returns and the items thereof, or the
      inspection by the corporation counsel or other legal representatives  of
      the  city, or by the district attorney of any county within the city, of
      the return of any taxpayer who shall bring action to set aside or review
      the tax based thereon, or against whom an  action  or  proceeding  under
      this  chapter  may  be  instituted. Returns shall be preserved for three
      years  and  thereafter  until  the  commissioner  permits  them  to   be
      destroyed.
        (b) (1) Any officer or employee of the city who willfully violates the
      provisions  of  subdivision  (a) of this section shall be dismissed from
      office and be incapable of holding any public office in this city for  a
      period of five years thereafter.
        (2) Cross-reference: For criminal penalties, see chapter forty of this
      title.
        (c)  This  section  shall  be  deemed  a state statute for purposes of
      paragraph (a) of subdivision two of section eighty-seven of  the  public
      officers law.
        d.  Notwithstanding  anything  in subdivision a of this section to the
      contrary, if a taxpayer has petitioned  the  tax  appeals  tribunal  for
      administrative  review as provided in section one hundred seventy of the
      charter, the commissioner of finance shall be authorized to  present  to
      the  tribunal  any report or return of such taxpayer, or any information
      contained therein or relating thereto, which may be material or relevant
      to the proceeding before the tribunal. The tax appeals tribunal shall be
      authorized to publish a copy or  a  summary  of  any  decision  rendered
      pursuant to section one hundred seventy-one of the charter.

        § 11-2416 Notices and limitations of time. a. Any notice authorized or
      required  under  the  provisions of this chapter may be given by mailing
      the same to the person for whom it is intended in  a  postpaid  envelope
      addressed  to  such person at the address given in the last return filed
      by him or her pursuant to the provisions  of  this  chapter  or  in  any
      application  made  by  him  or  her,  or, if no return has been filed or
      application made, then to such address as may be obtainable. The mailing
      of such notice shall be presumptive evidence of the receipt of the  same
      by  the person to whom addressed. Any period of time which is determined
      according to the provisions of this chapter  by  the  giving  of  notice
      shall commence to run from the date of mailing of such notice.
        b. The provisions of the civil practice law and rules or any other law
      relative  to  limitations  of time for the enforcement of a civil remedy
      shall not apply to any proceeding or action taken by the city  to  levy,
      appraise,  assess,  determine  or  enforce  the collection of any tax or
      penalty or interest provided by this chapter.  However,  except  in  the
      case  of  a wilfully false or fraudulent return with intent to evade the
      tax, no assessment of additional tax shall be made after the  expiration
      of  more  than  three  years  from  the  date of the filing of a return,
      provided, however, that where no return has been filed  as  provided  by
      law the tax may be assessed at any time.
        c.  Where,  before  the expiration of the period prescribed herein for
      the assessment of an additional tax, a taxpayer has consented in writing
      that such period be extended, the amount of such additional tax due  may
      be  determined  at  any  time within such extended period. The period so
      extended may be further extended by subsequent consents in writing  made
      before the expiration of the extended period.
        d.  If  any  return,  claim,  statement, notice, application, or other
      document required to be filed, or  any  payment  required  to  be  made,
      within  a  prescribed  period  or  on  or before a prescribed date under
      authority of any provision of this chapter is, after such period or such
      date, delivered by United States mail to the  commissioner  of  finance,
      the  tax  appeals tribunal, bureau, office, officer or person with which
      or with whom such document is required to be filed, or to  which  or  to
      whom  such payment is required to be made, the date of the United States
      postmark stamped on the envelope shall be  deemed  to  be  the  date  of
      delivery.  This  subdivision shall apply only if the postmark date falls
      within the prescribed period or on or before the prescribed date for the
      filing of such document,  or  for  making  the  payment,  including  any
      extension  granted for such filing or payment, and only if such document
      or  payment  was  deposited  in  the  mail,  postage  prepaid,  properly
      addressed  to  the  commissioner  of  finance, the tax appeals tribunal,
      bureau, office, officer or person with which or with whom  the  document
      is  required to be filed or to which or to whom such payment is required
      to be made. If any document is sent by United  States  registered  mail,
      such  registration  shall be prima facie evidence that such document was
      delivered to the commissioner of  finance,  the  tax  appeals  tribunal,
      bureau, office, officer or person to which or to whom addressed, and the
      date of registration shall be deemed the postmark date. The commissioner
      of  finance and, where relevant, the tax appeals tribunal are authorized
      to provide by regulation the extent  to  which  the  provisions  of  the
      preceding  sentence with respect to prima facie evidence of delivery and
      the postmark date shall apply to certified mail. Except as  provided  in
      subdivision  f of this section, this subdivision shall apply in the case
      of postmarks not made by the United States postal service only if and to
      the extent provided by regulation of the  commissioner  of  finance  or,
      where relevant, the tax appeals tribunal.
    
        e.  When  the  last  day  prescribed  under  authority of this chapter
      (including any extension of time) for performing  any  act  falls  on  a
      Saturday,  Sunday or legal holiday in the state, the performance of such
      act shall be considered timely if it is performed on the next succeeding
      day which is not a Saturday, Sunday or legal holiday.
        f.  (1)  Any  reference in subdivision d of this section to the United
      States mail shall be treated as including a reference  to  any  delivery
      service designated by the secretary of the treasury of the United States
      pursuant  to  section  seventy-five  hundred two of the internal revenue
      code and any reference in subdivision d of  this  section  to  a  United
      States  postmark  shall be treated as including a reference to any date
      recorded or marked in  the  manner  described  in  section  seventy-five
      hundred  two  of  the  internal  revenue  code  by a designated delivery
      service. If the commissioner of finance finds that any delivery  service
      designated  by  such  secretary is inadequate for the needs of the city,
      the commissioner of finance may withdraw such designation  for  purposes
      of this title. The commissioner of finance may also designate additional
      delivery  services  meeting the criteria of section seventy-five hundred
      two of the internal revenue code for purposes  of  this  title,  or  may
      withdraw  any such designation if the commissioner of finance finds that
      a delivery service so designated is inadequate  for  the  needs  of  the
      city.  Any  reference  in  subdivision  d  of this section to the United
      States mail shall be treated as including a reference  to  any  delivery
      service  designated  by the commissioner of finance and any reference in
      subdivision d of this section to  a  United  States  postmark  shall  be
      treated  as  including a reference to any date recorded or marked in the
      manner described in section seventy-five hundred  two  of  the  internal
      revenue  code  by  a  delivery service designated by the commissioner of
      finance. Notwithstanding the foregoing, any withdrawal of designation or
      additional designation by the  commissioner  of  finance  shall  not  be
      effective  for purposes of service upon the tax appeals tribunal, unless
      and until such withdrawal of designation or  additional  designation  is
      ratified by the president of the tax appeals tribunal.
        (2)  Any  equivalent of registered or certified mail designated by the
      United States secretary of the treasury, or as may be designated by  the
      commissioner  of  finance  pursuant  to  the  same criteria used by such
      secretary for such designations pursuant to section seventy-five hundred
      two of the internal revenue code, shall be included within  the  meaning
      of  registered  or  certified  mail  as  used  in  subdivision d of this
      section. If the commissioner of finance finds  that  any  equivalent  of
      registered  or  certified  mail  designated  by  such  secretary  or the
      commissioner of finance is inadequate for the needs  of  the  city,  the
      commissioner  of  finance  may withdraw such designation for purposes of
      this title. Notwithstanding the foregoing, any withdrawal of designation
      or additional designation by the commissioner of finance  shall  not  be
      effective  for purposes of service upon the tax appeals tribunal, unless
      and until such withdrawal of designation or  additional  designation  is
      ratified by the president of the tax appeals tribunal.
