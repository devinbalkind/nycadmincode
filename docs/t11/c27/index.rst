      be paid an annual vault charge, beginning as  of  July  first,  nineteen
      hundred  sixty-two, for the privilege of occupying, using or maintaining
      a vault in the streets of the city, to be  paid  by  the  owner  of  the

      for  each additional ten feet in depth or fraction thereof calculated by

      such total area the same rates as provided in subparagraphs one and two.
      The  additional  area  for  any additional depth of ten feet or fraction
      thereof shall however, be reduced by ten per cent for each foot of depth
      less than ten feet.
        (B) For periods beginning on or after  July  first,  nineteen  hundred

      however, be reduced by ten percent for each foot of depth less than  ten
      feet.

      adding the plane or surface area for each such additional depth  to  the

      total area the same rate as provided in subparagraph one. The additional
      area for any additional depth of ten  feet  or  fraction  thereof  shall

      vault  charge  or  additional  charge  shall be imposed pursuant to this
      chapter on or after June first, nineteen hundred ninety-eight.
        (b) Where the owner of the premises immediately adjoining the vault is
      exempt from or otherwise not liable for the  annual  vault  charge,  the
      tenant,  lessee or any other person using, occupying or maintaining such

        (c) The annual vault charge imposed by this section shall be due from,
      and shall be paid by, the person  who  is  the  owner  of  the  premises
      immediately adjoining the vault on the first day of July of the year for
      which  such  charge  is  imposed  except  that, on and after June first,
      nineteen  hundred  seventy-two, such charge shall be due from, and shall
      be paid by the person who is  the  owner  of  the  premises  immediately
      adjoining  the vault on the first day of June of the year for which such
      charge is imposed. Where the annual vault charge is imposed pursuant  to
      subdivision  (b)  of this section, such annual vault charge shall be due
      from and paid  by,  the  tenant,  lessee  or  any  other  person  using,
      occupying  or maintaining the vault on the first day of July of the year
      for which such charge is imposed, except that for years beginning on  or
      after June first, nineteen hundred seventy-two, such charge shall be due
      from,  and  paid  by,  the  tenant,  lessee  or  any other person using,

      for which such charge is imposed.
        (d)  In  the  event  that  the  annual vault charge as imposed by this
      chapter shall be held invalid, then such annual vault  charge  shall  be
      deemed a tax on the same basis and at the same rates as provided in this
      chapter  and  all  other  provisions  of  this  chapter shall be equally
      applicable.
        (e) Where, prior to the first day of August in any year in  which  the
      annual  vault  charge  imposed  hereunder shall be due and payable, if a
      vault or part thereof is made unavailable  for  use  or  occupancy,  the
      annual  vault  charge  paid for such year, pursuant to the provisions of
      this chapter,  shall  be  refunded  in  full  upon  application  to  and
      furnishing  of  such  proof  as the commissioner of finance may require.
      Where such closing of a vault occurs prior to the last day  of  December
      in  any  such  year,  fifty  percent  of the annual vault charge due and
      actually paid for  such  year  shall  be  refunded  to  the  payor  upon
      application  to  and  furnishing  of  such  proof as the commissioner of
      finance may require. Where such closing is limited to a part of a vault,
      such a refund shall be granted only  to  the  extent  that  the  closing
      reduces  the  area of the vault and thereby the amount of the charge for
      the vault.

      August,  nineteen  hundred sixty-two, and on or before the fifteenth day
      of July of every year thereafter, file with the commissioner of  finance
      a  return  showing  the  dimensions of the vault as to length, width and
      depth, except that the return required to be filed  on  or  before  July
      fifteenth, nineteen hundred seventy-two shall be filed on or before June
      fifteenth,  nineteen  hundred  seventy-two  and those due in later years
      shall be required to be filed on or before June fifteenth of such years.
      The commissioner of finance, if he or she deems it necessary  to  insure
      adequate information with regard to the proper charge to be imposed, may
      require  information returns from other persons, including the owners of
      real property regardless of whether a vault has been extended therefrom,
      the users or lessees of the vault or lessees or tenants of the  property
      adjoining the vault.
        b.  The  forms  of  returns shall be prescribed by the commissioner of
      finance and shall contain  such  information  as  he  or  she  may  deem
      necessary  for  the  proper  administration  of  this  chapter;  and the
      commissioner of  finance  or  his  or  her  duly  authorized  agents  or
      employees  shall  be  empowered  to  require  supplemental returns. If a
      return required by this chapter is not filed or if the return when filed
      is incorrect or insufficient on its face, the  commissioner  of  finance
      shall take the necessary steps to enforce the filing of such a return or
      of a corrected return. Upon failure to comply with a notice to furnish a
      return  or  a sufficient return, the commissioner of finance may require

      return  form shall be accompanied by instructions which explain in clear
      and simple terms how to determine the dimensions and  extent  of  street
      occupancy  of  a  vault,  how to calculate the amount of the charge, and
      such other matters as the commissioner considers necessary or helpful to
      an understanding of the requirements of  this  chapter.  Notwithstanding
      the  foregoing,  neither  the  failure  of the commissioner to mail such
      return form and instructions nor the failure of any  person  to  receive
      the  same  shall relieve any person of the obligation to file any return
      required under this section or of liability for the charge, interest  or
      penalties imposed by this chapter.
        d.  If  no  form  or other notice has previously been sent to a person
      subject to the annual vault charge with respect to the amount  of  vault
      charge  owed for any year, the commissioner of finance shall notify such
      person of the amount owed as soon as practicable after discovering  that
      such amount is owed.

      this chapter. Such charge shall be due and payable on the  last  day  on
      which  such  return is required to be filed, without regard to whether a
      return is filed or whether the return which is filed correctly shows the
      amount due.
        b. The charge otherwise required to be paid with the return due on  or
      before  June  fifteenth,  nineteen  hundred  eighty shall be paid in two
      equal installments as follows: one-half of the charge shall be paid with

Section 11-2706 ::    
        
     
        ยง  11-2706  Presumption  and  burden  of proof. For the purpose of the
      proper administration of this chapter and  to  prevent  evasion  of  the
      annual  vault  charge hereby imposed, it shall be presumed, except where
      the depth of a vault exceeds twelve feet, that the size of the vault  as
      indicated  upon  the  license  therefor originally issued by the borough
      president up to and including December  thirty-first,  nineteen  hundred
      sixty-two, and the commissioner of transportation thereafter is a proper
      measure  of the charge until the contrary is established, and the burden
      of proving that the size of the vault is not accurately stated upon  the
      license  shall be upon the person so claiming. In cases where no license
      of record has been issued for a vault or where  the  depth  of  a  vault
      exceeds  twelve feet, the burden of proving the actual size of the vault
      shall be upon the person liable for the vault charge.

Section 11-2707 ::    
        
     
        ยง  11-2707 Determination of vault charge. If a return required by this
      chapter is not  filed  or  if  a  return  when  filed  is  incorrect  or
      insufficient,  the amount of the vault charge due shall be determined by
      the commissioner of finance from such information as may  be  obtainable
      and,  if necessary, the charge may be estimated on the basis of external
      indices, including but not limited to the records of the  department  of
      transportation,  the reports of tax assessors, the reports of inspectors
      and investigators in the offices of  the  commissioner  of  finance  and
      commissioner  of  transportation,  and/or  other information or factors.
      Notice of such determination shall be given to the person liable for the
      payment thereof. Such determination shall finally  and  irrevocably  fix
      the  vault  charge  unless the person against whom it is assessed shall,
      within ninety days after the giving of notice of such determination, or,
      if the commissioner of finance has established a conciliation  procedure
      pursuant  to  section 11-124 of the code and such person has requested a
      conciliation conference in accordance therewith, within ninety days from
      the mailing of a conciliation decision or the date of the commissioner's
      confirmation of the discontinuance of the conciliation proceeding,  both
      (1)  serves  a petition upon the commissioner of finance and (2) files a
      petition with the tax appeals tribunal, or unless  the  commissioner  of
      finance  of  his or her own motion shall redetermine the same. Upon such
      hearing the tax appeals tribunal may require the filing of a certificate
      signed by a city surveyor specifying the dimensions of the vault.  After
      such  hearing the tax appeals tribunal shall give notice of its decision
      to the person against whom the vault charge is assessed. A  decision  of
      the  tax appeals tribunal sitting en banc shall be reviewable for error,
      illegality or unconstitutionality or any other reason  whatsoever  by  a
      proceeding  under  article  seventy-eight  of the civil practice law and
      rules if application therefor is made to the supreme court by the person
      against whom the vault charge was assessed within four months after  the
      giving of the notice of such tax appeals tribunal decision. A proceeding
      under  article  seventy-eight  of the civil practice law and rules shall
      not be instituted by a person against whom the vault charge is  assessed
      unless  (a)  the  amount of any vault charge sought to be reviewed, with
      penalties and interest thereon, if any, shall be  first  deposited  with
      the   commissioner  of  finance  and  there  shall  be  filed  with  the
      commissioner of finance an undertaking in  such  amount  and  with  such
      sureties  as a justice of the supreme court shall approve, to the effect
      that if such proceeding be dismissed or the vault charge  confirmed  the
      person  against whom the vault charge is assessed will pay all costs and
      charges which may accrue in the prosecution of the proceeding, or (b) at
      the option of such person, such undertaking filed with the  commissioner
      of  finance  may  be  in  a  sum  sufficient  to cover the vault charge,
      penalties and interest thereon stated in such decision  plus  the  costs
      and  charges  which  may accrue against him or her in the prosecution of
      the proceeding, in which event such person  shall  not  be  required  to
      deposit  such  vault  charge,  penalties  and  interest  as  a condition
      precedent to the application.

        ยง  11-2708  Refunds.  a.  In  the manner provided in this section, the
      commissioner of finance shall refund or credit,  without  interest,  any
      vault   charge,   penalty   or   interest   erroneously,   illegally  or
      unconstitutionally collected or paid if application to the  commissioner
      of  finance  for  such  refund  shall  be  made within one year from the
      payment thereof. Whenever a refund is made or denied by the commissioner
      of finance, he or she shall state his or her reason  therefor  and  give
      notice thereof to the applicant in writing. Such application may be made
      by the owner of the premises, or other person, who has actually paid the
      vault  charge.  The  commissioner  of finance may, in lieu of any refund
      required to be made, allow credit therefor  on  payments  due  from  the
      applicant.
        b.  Any  determination of the commissioner of finance denying a refund
      or credit pursuant to subdivision a of this section shall be  final  and
      irrevocable  unless  the  applicant  for  such  refund or credit, within
      ninety days from the mailing of notice of such determination, or, if the
      commissioner  of  finance  has  established  a  conciliation   procedure
      pursuant  to section 11-124 of the administrative code and the applicant
      has requested a conciliation conference in accordance therewith,  within
      ninety  days  from the mailing of a conciliation decision or the date of
      the  commissioner's  confirmation   of   the   discontinuance   of   the
      conciliation   proceeding,   both   (1)   serves  a  petition  upon  the
      commissioner of finance and (2) files a petition with  the  tax  appeals
      tribunal  for  a  hearing. Such petition for a refund or credit, made as
      herein provided, shall be deemed an application for a  revision  of  any
      vault  charge,  penalty  or interest complained of. Such hearing and any
      appeal to the tax appeals tribunal sitting en  banc  from  the  decision
      rendered in such hearing shall be conducted in the manner and subject to
      the  requirements  prescribed  by  the  tax appeals tribunal pursuant to
      sections one hundred sixty-eight through one hundred seventy-two of  the
      charter.  After such hearing, the tax appeals tribunal shall give notice
      of its decision to the applicant and to the commissioner of finance. The
      applicant shall be entitled to review such decision of the  tax  appeals
      tribunal   sitting   en   banc  by  a  proceeding  pursuant  to  article
      seventy-eight of  the  civil  practice  law  and  rules,  provided  such
      proceeding  is  instituted  within  four  months after the giving of the
      notice of such decision, and provided, in the case of an application  by
      a  person  against  whom  the  vault  charge  is  assessed, that a final
      determination of the vault charge due was not previously  made.  Such  a
      proceeding  shall  not  be instituted by a person against whom the vault
      charge is assessed unless an undertaking is filed with the  commissioner
      of  finance  in  such  amount and with such sureties as a justice of the
      supreme court shall approve to the effect that  if  such  proceeding  be
      dismissed  or the vault charge confirmed, such person will pay all costs
      and charges which may accrue in the prosecution of such proceeding.

      under this section of a vault charge, interest or penalty which had been

Section 11-2711 ::    
        
     
        ยง  11-2711 Proceedings to recover annual vault charge. a. Whenever any
      person shall fail to pay any vault charge, penalty or  interest  imposed
      by  this chapter as herein provided, the corporation counsel shall, upon
      the request of the  commissioner  of  finance  bring,  or  cause  to  be
      brought,  an  action to enforce the payment of the same on behalf of the
      city of New York in any court of the state of New York or of  any  other
      state or of the United States.
        b. As an additional remedy or as an alternate remedy, the commissioner
      of finance may issue a warrant, directed to the city sheriff, commanding
      him  or  her to levy upon and sell the real and personal property of the
      person liable for vault charges which may be found within the  city  for
      the  payment of the amount thereof, with any penalties and interest, and
      the cost of executing the warrant, and to return  such  warrant  to  the
      commissioner  of finance and to pay to him or her the money collected by
      virtue thereof within sixty days after the receipt of such warrant.  The
      city  sheriff  shall  within  five days after the receipt of the warrant
      file with the county clerk a copy  thereof,  and  thereupon  such  clerk
      shall  enter  in the judgment docket the name of the person mentioned in
      the warrant and the amount of the vault charge, penalty and interest for
      which the warrant is issued and  the  date  when  such  copy  is  filed.
      Thereupon  the  amount  of  such warrant so docketed shall become a lien
      upon the title to and interest in real  and  personal  property  of  the
      person  against  whom the warrant is issued. The city sheriff shall then
      proceed upon the warrant in the same manner, and with  like  effect,  as
      that  provided  by  law in respect to executions issued against property
      upon judgments of a court of record and for services  in  executing  the
      warrant  he  or  she shall be entitled to the same fees, which he or she
      may collect in the same manner. In the discretion of the commissioner of
      finance a warrant of like terms, force and  effect  may  be  issued  and
      directed  to an officer or employee of the department of finance, and in
      the execution thereof such officer or employee shall have all the powers
      conferred by law upon sheriffs, but shall  be  entitled  to  no  fee  or
      compensation in excess of the actual expenses paid in the performance of
      such  duty.  If  a  warrant  is  returned  not  satisfied  in  full, the
      commissioner of finance may from time to time  issue  new  warrants  and
      shall  also  have the same remedies to enforce the amount due thereunder
      as if the city had recovered judgment therefor and execution thereon had
      been returned unsatisfied.
        c. In addition to any other lien provided for  in  this  section,  the
      annual vault charge imposed by this chapter shall become a lien, binding
      upon  the  premises  immediately  adjoining such vault, on the date such
      charge is required to be paid until the same is paid in full.
        d. The commissioner of finance, if he or she finds that the  interests
      of the city will not thereby be jeopardized, and upon such conditions as
      the  commissioner  of finance may require, may release any property from
      the lien of any warrant or vacate such warrant for unpaid vault charges,
      additions to vault charges, penalties and  interest  filed  pursuant  to
      subdivision  b  of  this  section,  and  such release or vacating of the
      warrant may be recorded in the office of any recording officer in  which
      such  warrant  has  been  filed.  The  clerk  shall thereupon cancel and
      discharge as of the original date of docketing the vacated warrant.

      the dimensions of a vault and the owner of the premises  has  failed  to
      comply,  he  or  she may obtain such certificate and, in such situation,
      the necessary expense of obtaining such certificate shall  constitute  a
      lien against such premises until paid.
        8.  The  commissioner of finance or his or her designated employees or
      agents  shall  have  power  to  inspect  premises  for  the  purpose  of
      determining the extent, if any, of liability imposed by this chapter.

      compounded  daily.  Interest under this subdivision shall not be paid if
      the amount thereof is less than one dollar.
        (b) * (1) Failure to file return. (A) In case of  failure  to  file  a
      return  under  this chapter on or before the prescribed date (determined
      with regard to any extension of time for filing),  unless  it  is  shown
      that  such  failure  is  due  to reasonable cause and not due to willful
      neglect, there shall be added to the amount  required  to  be  shown  as
      vault charge on such return five percent of the amount of such charge if

      one percent of such charge if the failure  is  not  for  more  than  one
      month,  with  an  additional one-half of one percent for each additional
      month or fraction thereof  during  which  such  failure  continues,  not

      this section, but if no such rate of interest is set, such rate shall be
      deemed to be set at seven and one-half  percent  per  annum.  Such  rate
      shall  be  the  rate prescribed in paragraph two of this subdivision but
      shall not be less than seven and one-half percent per  annum.  Any  such
      rate set by the commissioner of finance shall apply to vault charges, or

      connection with section six  thousand  six  hundred  twenty-one  of  the
      internal  revenue  code.  Any  such rate shall be rounded to the nearest

      shall be increased to the next highest full percent).
        (B) Period during which rate applies.

Section 11-2715 ::    
        
     
        ยง 11-2715 Notices and limitations of time. a. Any notice authorized or
      required under the provisions of this chapter may be given to the person
      for  whom  it is intended by mailing it in a postpaid envelope addressed
      to such person at the address given in the return filed by  him  or  her
      pursuant to the provisions of this chapter or in any application made by
      him  or  her  or,  if no such return has been filed or application made,
      then to the address of the premises immediately adjoining the vault. The
      mailing  of  a  notice  as  in  this  subdivision  provided,  shall   be
      presumptive  evidence  of  the receipt of the same by the person to whom
      addressed. Any period of time  which  is  determined  according  to  the
      provisions of this chapter by the giving of notice shall commence to run
      from the date of mailing of such notice as in this subdivision provided.
        b. The provisions of the civil practice law and rules or any other law
      relative  to  limitations  of time for the enforcement of a civil remedy
      shall not apply to any  proceeding  or  action  taken  by  the  city  to
      appraise, assess, determine, levy or enforce the collection of any vault
      charge  or penalty provided by this chapter. However, except in the case
      of a wilfully false or fraudulent return with intent to evade the  vault
      charge,  no  assessment  shall be made after the expiration of more than
      three years from the date of such return; provided, however, that  where
      no return has been filed as provided by law, the annual vault charge may
      be assessed at any time.
        c.  Where,  before  the expiration of the period prescribed herein for
      the assessment of an additional vault charge, a person has consented  in
      writing  that  such  period  be  extended, the amount of such additional
      vault charge due may be determined at  any  time  within  such  extended
      period.  The  period  so  extended may be further extended by subsequent
      consents in writing made before the expiration of the extended period.
        d. If any return, claim,  statement,  notice,  application,  or  other
      document  required  to  be  filed,  or  any payment required to be made,
      within a prescribed period or on  or  before  a  prescribed  date  under
      authority of any provision of this chapter is, after such period or such
      date,  delivered  by  United States mail to the commissioner of finance,
      the tax appeals tribunal, bureau, office, officer or person  with  which
      or  with  whom  such document is required to be filed, or to which or to
      whom such payment is required to be made, the date of the United  States
      postmark  stamped  on  the  envelope  shall  be deemed to be the date of
      delivery. This subdivision shall apply only if the postmark  date  falls
      within the prescribed period or on or before the prescribed date for the
      filing  of  such  document,  or  for  making  the payment, including any
      extension granted for such filing or payment, and only if such  document
      or  payment  was  deposited  in  the  mail,  postage  prepaid,  properly
      addressed to the commissioner of  finance,  the  tax  appeals  tribunal,
      bureau,  office,  officer or person with which or with whom the document
      is required to be filed or to which or to whom such payment is  required
      to  be  made.  If any document is sent by United States registered mail,
      such registration shall be prima facie evidence that such  document  was
      delivered  to  the  commissioner  of  finance, the tax appeals tribunal,
      bureau, office, officer or person to which or to whom addressed, and the
      date of registration shall be deemed the postmark date. The commissioner
      of finance and, where relevant, the tax appeals tribunal are  authorized
      to  provide  by  regulation  the  extent  to which the provisions of the
      preceding sentence with respect to prima facie evidence of delivery  and
      the  postmark date shall apply to certified mail. This subdivision shall
      apply in the case of postmarks not made  by  the  United  States  postal
      service  only  if  and  to  the  extent  provided  by  regulation of the
      commissioner of finance or, where relevant, the tax appeals tribunal.
    
        e. When the last  day  prescribed  under  authority  of  this  chapter
      (including  any  extension  of  time)  for performing any act falls on a
      Saturday, Sunday or legal holiday in the state, the performance of  such
      act shall be considered timely if it is performed on the next succeeding
      day which is not a Saturday, Sunday or legal holiday.

Section 11-2715.1 ::    
        
     
        ยง 11-2715.1 Vault charge amnesty program. a. Notwithstanding any other
      provision  of  law  to  the  contrary,  there  is  hereby  established a
      nine-month amnesty program, beginning January  first,  nineteen  hundred
      eighty-nine and ending September thirtieth, nineteen hundred eighty-nine
      (hereinafter referred to as the "amnesty period"), for all persons owing
      the  annual  vault  charge imposed by this chapter. Such amnesty program
      shall be administered by the commissioner of finance and shall apply  to
      liabilities  for  annual  vault charge years ending prior to June first,
      nineteen hundred eighty-nine.
        b. (1) A person seeking amnesty pursuant to this section must,  during
      the  amnesty  period,  file  a  written  application  therefor  with the
      commissioner of finance, on a form prescribed by the  commissioner,  and
      must  provide such information as the commissioner may require. In order
      to qualify for amnesty, such person must pay all  annual  vault  charges
      for  which  he  or  she  is  liable.  Upon payment by such person to the
      commissioner of all such charges as provided in  this  subdivision,  the
      commissioner  shall  waive any applicable penalties and interest, and no
      civil, administrative or criminal action or proceeding shall be  brought
      against  such  person  with respect to the charges so paid. In addition,
      the commissioner shall  release  the  lien  binding  upon  the  premises
      immediately  adjoining  the  vault  pursuant to subdivision c of section
      11-2711 of this chapter for charges which became payable  prior  to  the
      time  such  person  acquired  title  to the premises. Failure to pay all
      charges as provided in this subdivision  shall  invalidate  any  amnesty
      granted pursuant to this section.
        (2)  In the case of any vault adjoining premises owned by a person who
      (A) prior to January  first,  nineteen  hundred  eighty-nine,  paid  all
      annual  vault charges and interest and penalties for which he or she was
      liable, and (B) is otherwise in full compliance with this  chapter,  the
      commissioner of finance shall release the lien binding upon the premises
      immediately  adjoining  the  vault  pursuant to subdivision c of section
      11-2711 of this chapter for charges which became payable  prior  to  the
      time such person acquired title to the premises.
        c.  Amnesty  shall  not be granted to any person subject to the annual
      vault charge who is a party to any civil litigation which is pending  on
      the  date of such person's application in any court of this state or the
      United States for nonpayment or other delinquency  in  relation  to  the
      annual  vault  charge.  A  civil  litigation  shall  not be deemed to be
      pending if such person withdraws  from  such  litigation  prior  to  the
      granting of amnesty.
        d.  No  refund  or  credit shall be granted of any penalty or interest
      paid prior to the time the person subject to  the  annual  vault  charge
      makes a request for amnesty pursuant to subdivision b of this section.
        e.  Unless  the  commissioner  of  finance  on  his  or her own motion
      redetermines the amount of the annual vault charge, no refund or  credit
      shall be granted of any charges paid under this section.
        f. The commissioner of finance shall formulate such regulations as are
      necessary,  issue  forms  and  instructions,  and take any and all other
      actions  necessary  to  implement  the  provisions  of   this   section.
      Furthermore, prior to and throughout the duration of the amnesty period,
      the  commissioner  of  finance  shall  implement  a plan for prominently
      announcing and explaining  the  amnesty  program.  Such  plan  shall  be
      reasonably  calculated  to  inform all property owners who may be liable
      for vault charges and may include  written  announcements  sent  in  tax
      bills  and  other  mailings  done  by  the  city of New York to property
      owners, public service announcements, advertisements  in  newspapers  of
      general circulation and notification of community boards. The plan shall
    
      include,   but  not  be  limited  to,  information  which  explains  the
      determination of vault size and charge.

      circumstance  shall  for  any reason be adjudged by a court of competent
      jurisdiction to be invalid, such judgment shall not  affect,  impair  or
      invalidate  the  remainder of this chapter or the application thereof to
      other persons or circumstances, but shall be confined in  its  operation
      to  the  clause,  sentence,  paragraph, section or part thereof directly
      involved in the controversy in  which  such  judgment  shall  have  been
      rendered and to the person or circumstance involved.
