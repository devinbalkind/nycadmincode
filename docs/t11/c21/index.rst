      property taxable as hereafter provided);
        (7)  (i)  at the rate of one percent of the consideration with respect

      considered rent for purposes of the tax imposed by chapter seven of this
      title; and
        (8) at the rate of two percent of the consideration  with  respect  to
      all  other  conveyances  made  on  or after July first, nineteen hundred

      three-family house or an individual dwelling unit in a dwelling which is
      to  be  occupied or is occupied as the residence or home of four or more
      families living independently of each other where the  consideration  is

        Where  any  real property is situated partly within and partly without

      consideration and total net consideration attributable to  that  portion
      of  such  real  property  situated within the city of New York or to the
      interest in such portion.
        b. (1) In addition to the taxes imposed by  subdivision  a,  there  is
      hereby imposed a tax on each instrument or transaction (unless evidenced
      by  a  deed  subject  to  tax  under  subdivision a), at the time of the
      transfer, whereby any economic interest in real property is  transferred
      by  a  grantor to a grantee, where the consideration exceeds twenty-five
      thousand dollars.
        (A) With respect to such transfers made on or after  July  thirteenth,
      nineteen  hundred  eighty-six  and before August first, nineteen hundred
      eighty-nine, the tax shall be (i) at the rate  of  one  percent  of  the

      transferred  is  a  one,  two  or  three-family  house,  an   individual
      cooperative  apartment, an individual residential condominium unit or an
      individual dwelling unit in a dwelling which is to  be  occupied  or  is
      occupied  as  the  residence  or  home  of  four or more families living
      independently of each other, or where the consideration for the transfer
      is less than five hundred thousand dollars, and (ii) at the rate of  two
      percent of the consideration with respect to all other transfers.
        (B)  With  respect  to  such  transfers made on or after August first,
      nineteen hundred eighty-nine, the tax shall be at the following rates:
        (i) at the rate of one percent of the  consideration  where  the  real
      property,  the  economic interest in which is transferred, is a one, two
      or  three-family  house,  an  individual   cooperative   apartment,   an
      individual  residential  condominium unit or an individual dwelling unit
      in a dwelling which is to be occupied or is occupied as the residence or
      home of four or more families living independently  of  each  other  and
      where  the  consideration  for  such transfer of an economic interest in
      such real property is five hundred thousand dollars or less, and at  the
      rate  of  one and four hundred twenty-five thousandths of one percent of
      the consideration where  the  consideration  for  such  transfer  of  an
      economic  interest  in  such property is more than five hundred thousand
      dollars, and
        (ii) at the rate of one and four hundred  twenty-five  thousandths  of
      one  percent of the consideration with respect to all other transfers of

      hundred thousand dollars or less, and at the rate of two and six hundred
      twenty-five  thousandths  of  one percent of the consideration where the
      consideration for such transfers is  more  than  five  hundred  thousand
      dollars.
        (C)  Where  any  real  property,  the  economic  interest  in which is
      transferred, is situated partly within and partly without the boundaries
      of the city of New York, the consideration subject to tax shall be  such
      part  of  the  consideration  as is attributable to that portion of such
      real property which is situated within the city of New York.
        (2) Notwithstanding the definition of "controlling interest" contained
      in subdivision eight of section 11-2101  or  anything  to  the  contrary
      contained  in  subdivision  seven  of  that  section, in the case of any
      transfer of shares of stock in  a  cooperative  housing  corporation  in
      connection  with  the  grant or transfer of a proprietary leasehold, the
    
      tax imposed by this subdivision shall apply to (i) the original transfer
      of such shares of stock by the cooperative  corporation  or  cooperative
      plan  sponsor,  and (ii) any subsequent transfer of such shares of stock
      by  the  owner thereof. Notwithstanding any provision of this chapter to
      the contrary, in the case of a transfer described in clause (ii) of this
      paragraph  which  relates  to  an  individual  residential   unit,   the
      consideration  for  such  transfer  shall not include any portion of the
      unpaid principal of any mortgage on the real property of the cooperative
      housing corporation. In determining the tax on a transfer  described  in
      clause  (i)  of  this  paragraph,  a  credit  shall  be  allowed  for  a
      proportionate part of the amount of any tax paid upon the conveyance  to
      the  cooperative  housing  corporation  of  the  land  and  building  or
      buildings  comprising  the  cooperative  dwelling  or  dwellings.   Such
      proportionate  part  shall  be  the amount determined by multiplying the
      amount of tax paid  upon  the  conveyance  to  the  cooperative  housing
      corporation by a fraction, the numerator of which shall be the number of
      shares of stock transferred in a transaction described in clause (i) and
      the denominator of which shall be the total number of outstanding shares
      of  stock  of  the  cooperative housing corporation (including any stock
      held by the corporation). In no event, however, shall such credit reduce
      the tax on a transfer described in clause (i) below zero, nor shall  any
      such  credit  be  allowed  for any tax paid more than twenty-four months
      prior to the date on which occurs the first in a series of transfers  of
      shares of stock in an offering of cooperative housing corporation shares
      described  in  clause  (i).  For  purposes  of  this paragraph, the term
      "cooperative housing corporation" shall not include  a  housing  company
      organized and operating pursuant to the provisions of article two, four,
      five or eleven of the private housing finance law.
        (3) Notwithstanding the definition of "controlling interest" contained
      in  paragraph  eight  of  section  11-2101  or  anything to the contrary
      contained in  paragraph  seven  of  that  section,  in  the  case  of  a
      corporation (other than a cooperative housing corporation), partnership,
      association, trust or other entity formed for the purpose of cooperative
      ownership  of  real  property, the tax imposed by this subdivision shall
      apply to each transfer of shares of stock in such corporation,  interest
      in  such partnership, association or other entity or beneficial interest
      in such trust, in connection with the grant or transfer of a proprietary
      leasehold.  Notwithstanding  any  provision  of  this  chapter  to   the
      contrary,  in  the  case of a transfer described in this paragraph which
      relates to an individual  residential  unit  (other  than  the  original
      transfer  of  such  a unit by the cooperative entity or cooperative plan
      sponsor), the consideration for such  transfer  shall  not  include  any
      portion  of the unpaid principal of any mortgage on the real property of
      such corporation,  partnership,  association,  trust  or  other  entity.
      Notwithstanding any other provision of law to the contrary, all revenues
      arising  from  the  tax  imposed  pursuant  to  this  paragraph shall be
      credited to and deposited in the general fund of the city, but  no  part
      of  such  revenues  may  be  expended  unless appropriated in the annual
      budget of the city.
        c. (1) Anything to the contrary notwithstanding, in the  case  of  any
      conveyance or transfer of real property or any economic interest therein
      in  complete  or  partial  liquidation  of  a  corporation, partnership,
      association, trust or other entity, the taxes imposed  by  this  section
      shall  be  measured  by  (i)  the  consideration  for such conveyance or
      transfer, or (ii) the value of the real property  or  economic  interest
      therein, whichever is greater.
        (2)  If,  within  twenty-four  months  following  the  transfer  of an
      economic interest in real property which is subject to the  tax  imposed
    
      by  this  chapter,  the  corporation, partnership, association, trust or
      other entity owning the real property the economic interest in which was
      so transferred, is liquidated, and such real property is conveyed to the
      grantee or grantees of such economic interest, a credit shall be allowed
      against  the  tax  imposed  by  this  chapter  upon  such  conveyance in
      liquidation to such grantee or grantees. The amount of such credit shall
      be equal to the amount of the tax paid upon the prior  transfer  of  the
      economic  interest  in  such  real  property,  but  shall in no event be
      greater than the tax payable upon the conveyance in liquidation.
        d. In the case of a transfer of an economic  interest  in  any  entity
      that  owns  assets in addition to real property or interest therein, the
      consideration subject to tax shall be deemed equal to  the  fair  market
      value  of the real property or interest therein apportioned based on the
      percentage of the ownership interest in the entity transferred.
        e. (1) Notwithstanding anything contained in  this  section,  the  tax
      imposed  under  subdivisions  a and b on any deed or other instrument or
      transaction conveying or  transferring  real  property  or  an  economic
      interest  therein,  that  qualifies  as  a  real estate investment trust
      transfer, as defined below, shall be imposed at a rate  equal  to  fifty
      percent of the otherwise applicable rate.
        (2) For purposes of this subdivision e, a real estate investment trust
      transfer  shall  mean  (A)  any  deed or other instrument or transaction
      conveying or transferring real property or an economic interest  therein
      to  a  real  estate investment trust as defined in section eight hundred
      fifty-six of the internal revenue code (a "REIT") or to a partnership or
      corporation in which a REIT  owns  a  controlling  interest  immediately
      following the transaction; and
        (B)  any  issuance  or  transfer  of  an  interest  in a REIT, or in a
      partnership or corporation in which a REIT owns a  controlling  interest
      immediately  following  the  issuance  or  transfer in connection with a
      transaction  described  in   subparagraph   (A)   of   this   paragraph.
      Notwithstanding  the foregoing, a transaction described in the preceding
      sentence shall not constitute a real estate  investment  trust  transfer
      unless  (i)  it  occurs  in connection with the initial formation of the
      REIT and the conditions described in subparagraphs (C) and (D)  of  this
      paragraph  are  satisfied,  or  (ii)  in  the  case  of  any real estate
      investment  trust  transfer  occurring  on  or  after  July  thirteenth,
      nineteen  hundred  ninety-six  and  before September first, two thousand
      fourteen, the transaction is  described  in  subparagraph  (E)  of  this
      paragraph in which case the provision of such subparagraph shall apply.
        (C)  The  value  of  the  ownership  interests  in  the  REIT, or in a
      partnership  or  corporation  in  which  the  REIT  owns  a  controlling
      interest,  received  by the grantor as consideration for such conveyance
      or transfer must be equal to an amount not less than  forty  percent  of
      the  value  of  the  equity  interest  in  the real property or economic
      interest therein conveyed or transferred by the grantor to  the  grantee
      and  such  ownership interests must be retained by the grantor or owners
      of the grantor for a period of not less than  two  years  following  the
      date of such conveyance or transfer; provided, however, that in the case
      of  the  death of the grantor or an owner of the grantor within such two
      year period, this two year retention requirement shall be deemed  to  be
      satisfied  notwithstanding  any conveyance or transfer of such ownership
      interests held by such individual as a result of such death.  The  value
      of  the  equity  interest  in  such  real  property or economic interest
      therein shall be computed by subtracting from the consideration for  the
      conveyance or transfer of the real property or economic interest therein
      the   unpaid  balance  of  any  loans  secured  by  mortgages  or  other
      encumbrances which are liens on the real property or  economic  interest
    
      therein  immediately  before the conveyance or transfer. For purposes of
      this computation, in the case  of  a  conveyance  or  transfer  of  real
      property  other than a conveyance or transfer of an economic interest in
      real  property, the amount of the unpaid balance of any loans secured by
      mortgages or other encumbrances to be subtracted from  consideration  is
      determined  by multiplying the total unpaid balance of any loans secured
      by  mortgages  or  other  encumbrances  on  the  real  property  by  the
      percentage of the ownership interest in the real property being conveyed
      or  transferred to the grantee. In the case of a transfer of an economic
      interest in real property, such amount to be subtracted is equal to  the
      sum  of  the  following  amounts:  (i) a reasonable apportionment to the
      interests in real property owned by the entity  of  the  amount  of  any
      loans  secured  by encumbrances on the ownership interests in the entity
      which are being conveyed or transferred and (ii) the amount of any loans
      secured by mortgages or other encumbrances on the real property  of  the
      entity  multiplied  by  the  percentage  interest in the entity which is
      being conveyed or transferred.
        Provided, however, that for purposes of the computation made  pursuant
      to  this  subparagraph  (C),  any mortgages or other encumbrances on the
      real  property  or  economic  interest  therein  which  are  created  in
      contemplation  of  the initial formation of the REIT or in contemplation
      of the conveyance or transfer of such real property or economic interest
      therein to the REIT or to a partnership or corporation in which the REIT
      owns a controlling interest  immediately  following  the  conveyance  or
      transfer shall not be considered.
        (D) Seventy-five percent or more of the cash proceeds received by such
      REIT  from the sale of ownership interests in such REIT upon its initial
      formation must be used: (i) to make payments on  loans  secured  by  any
      interest  in real property (including an ownership interest in an entity
      owning real property) which is owned  directly  or  indirectly  by  such
      REIT;  (ii)  to  pay  for  capital  improvements to real property or any
      interest therein owned directly or indirectly by such REIT; (iii) to pay
      brokerage fees and commissions, professional fees and payments to or  on
      behalf  of  a  tenant as an inducement to enter into a lease or sublease
      incurred in connection with the creation  of  a  leasehold  or  sublease
      pertaining  to  real  property or any interest therein owned directly or
      indirectly by such REIT; (iv) to acquire any interest in  real  property
      (including  an  ownership  interest in any entity owning real property),
      apart from any acquisition to which a reduced rate of tax is  applicable
      pursuant  to  this subdivision (without regard to this subparagraph); or
      (v) for reserves established for any of the purposes described in clause
      (i),  (ii)  or  (iii)  of  this  subparagraph.  For  purposes  of   this
      subparagraph,  the  term  real  property  shall  include  real  property
      wherever located.
        (E) If a transaction otherwise described in subparagraph (A) or (B) of
      this  paragraph  occurs  other  than  in  connection  with  the  initial
      formation  of  a REIT, the condition set forth in subparagraph (D) shall
      be disregarded and such transaction  shall  constitute  a  "real  estate
      investment  trust  transfer"  if the condition set forth in subparagraph
      (C) would be satisfied if "fifty  percent"  is  substituted  for  "forty
      percent" therein.
        (3)  For  purposes  of determining the consideration for a real estate
      investment trust transfer taxable under this subdivision e the value  of
      the  real  property  or interest therein shall be equal to the estimated
      market value as determined by  the  commissioner  of  finance  for  real
      property  tax  purposes  as  reflected  on  the  most  recent  notice of
      assessment issued by such commissioner,  or  such  other  value  as  the
      taxpayer may establish to the satisfaction of such commissioner.
    
        (4)  This  subdivision  e  shall  only apply to real estate investment
      trust transfers occurring  on  or  after  the  effective  date  of  this
      subdivision.
        f. Notwithstanding any other provision of this chapter, in determining
      the  tax  imposed  by this chapter with respect to a deed, instrument or
      transaction conveying or transferring a one, two or three-family  house,
      an  individual  residential  condominium unit, an individual residential
      cooperative apartment, or an interest  therein,  the  consideration  for
      such  conveyance  or  transfer  shall  exclude,  to the extent otherwise
      included  therein,  the  amount  of  any  mortgage  or  other  lien   or
      encumbrance on the real property or interest therein that existed before
      the  delivery  of the deed or the transfer and remains thereon after the
      date of delivery of the deed or the transfer, other than  any  mortgage,
      lien  or  encumbrance  placed  on the property or interest in connection
      with, or in anticipation of, the conveyance or transfer, or by reason of
      deferred payments of the purchase price whether represented by notes  or
      otherwise. Provided, however, that this subdivision shall not apply to a
      conveyance  or  transfer  (1)  to  a  mortgagee, lienor or encumbrancer,
      regardless of whether the grantor or transferor  is  or  was  personally
      liable for the indebtedness secured by the mortgage, lien or encumbrance
      or  whether  the mortgage, lien or encumbrance is canceled of record, or
      (2) which qualifies as a "real  estate  investment  trust  transfer"  as
      defined in subdivision e of this section.

        ยง  11-2103  Presumptions  and  burden of proof. For the purpose of the
      proper administration of this chapter and to prevent evasion of the  tax
      hereby  imposed,  it  shall  be presumed that all deeds and transfers of
      economic interests in real property are taxable. Where the consideration
      includes property other than  money,  it  shall  be  presumed  that  the
      consideration  is  the  value  of the real property or interest therein.
      Such presumptions shall prevail until the contrary  is  established  and
      the  burden of proving the contrary shall be on the taxpayer. The burden
      of proving that a lien or encumbrance existed on the  real  property  or
      interest  therein  before  the delivery of the deed and remained thereon
      thereafter and the  burden  of  proving  the  amount  of  such  lien  or
      encumbrance  at  the  time  of  the delivery of the deed shall be on the
      taxpayer.

      grantor to the commissioner of finance at the office of the register  in
      the  county  where  the  deed is or would be recorded within thirty days
      after the delivery of the deed by the grantor to the grantee but  before
      the  recording of such deed, or, in the case of a tax on the transfer of
      an economic interest in real property, at such place as the commissioner
      of finance shall designate, within thirty days after the  transfer.  The
      grantee  shall  also  be liable for the payment of such tax in the event
      that the amount of tax due is not paid by the grantor or the grantor  is
      exempt  from  tax.  All moneys received as such payments by the register
      during the preceding month shall be transmitted to the  commissioner  of
      finance  on  the  first  day  of  each  month or on such other day as is
      mutually agreeable to the commissioner of finance and the register. From
      the moneys so received by him or her, the commissioner of finance  shall
      set said in a special account:
        (1)  the  total  amount of taxes imposed pursuant to the provisions of
      paragraph three of subdivision a of  section  11-2102  of  this  chapter
      including any interest or penalties thereon;
        (2) fifty percent of the total amount of taxes imposed pursuant to the
      provisions of paragraph four of subdivision a of section 11-2102 of this
      chapter,  including  fifty percent of any interest or penalties thereon,
      provided, however, that where such tax is measured by the  consideration
      for  a  conveyance  without  deduction for the amount of any mortgage or
      other lien or encumbrance on the real property or interest therein which
      existed before the delivery of the deed and remains  thereon  after  the
      delivery  of  the  deed, the entire amount of tax imposed at the rate of
      one percent on the portion  of  the  consideration  ascribable  to  such
      nondeductible   mortgage,  lien  or  other  encumbrance,  including  any
      interest or penalties thereon, and fifty  percent  of  the  tax  on  the
      balance of the consideration, including fifty percent of any interest or
      penalties thereon, shall be set aside in such special account;
        (3) fifty percent of the total amount of taxes imposed pursuant to the
      provisions  of subparagraph (iii) of paragraph seven of subdivision a of
      section 11-2102 of this chapter, including fifty percent of any interest
      or penalties thereon;

      provisions of paragraph eight of subdivision a  of  section  11-2102  of
      this  chapter,  including  fifty  percent  of  any interest or penalties
      thereon;

      two  percent pursuant to the provisions of clause (ii) of subparagraph A
      of paragraph one of subdivision b of section  11-2102  of  this  chapter
      including fifty percent of any interest or penalties thereon;
        (6)  with  respect  to any conveyance of real property, transfer of an
      economic interest therein, or any grant, assignment or  surrender  of  a
      leasehold  interest  in  real  property,  made on or after August first,
      nineteen hundred eighty-nine and taxable under  this  chapter,  in  each
      instance  where  the  tax rate is in excess of two percent, a portion of
      the tax received equal to one percent of the  consideration  subject  to
      the tax plus any interest or penalty attributable to such portion of the
      tax; and
        (7)  notwithstanding  anything  in subdivision six to the contrary, in
      each instance where the tax rate imposed pursuant to  subdivision  e  of
      section  11-2102  of this chapter is in excess of one percent, a portion
      of the tax received equal to  one-half  of  one  percent  of  the  total
      consideration  for  the  real  property  or  economic  interest  therein
      conveyed or transferred, plus any interest or  penalty  attributable  to
      such portion of the tax.
    
        Moneys  in such account shall be used for payment by such commissioner
      to the state comptroller for deposit in the urban mass transit operating
      assistance account of the mass transportation operating assistance  fund
      of  any  amount  of  insufficiency  certified  by  the state comptroller
      pursuant  to  the provisions of subdivision six of section eight-eight-a
      of the state finance law, and, on the fifteenth day of each  month,  the
      commissioner  of finance shall transmit all funds in such account on the
      last day of the preceding month, except  the  amount  required  for  the
      payment   of   any  amount  of  insufficiency  certified  by  the  state
      comptroller and such amount as he or she deems necessary for refunds and
      such other amounts necessary to finance the New York City transportation
      disabled  committee  and  the  New  York  City  paratransit  system   as
      established  by  section  fifteen-b of the transportation law, provided,
      however, that such amounts shall not exceed six  percent  of  the  total
      funds  in  the  account  but  in  no  event  be  less  than  one hundred
      seventy-five thousand dollars beginning April  first,  nineteen  hundred
      eighty-six,  and  further  that  beginning  November fifteenth, nineteen
      hundred eighty-four and during the entire period prior to  operation  of
      such  system,  the  total of such amounts shall not exceed three hundred
      seventy-five thousand dollars for the administrative  expenses  of  such
      committee  and  fifty  thousand  dollars  for the expenses of the agency
      designated pursuant to paragraph b of subdivision five of such  section,
      and  other  amounts  necessary  to  finance  the  operating needs of the
      private bus companies franchised by the city of New York and eligible to
      receive state operating  assistance  under  section  eighteen-b  of  the
      transportation  law,  provided,  however,  that  such  amounts shall not
      exceed four percent of the total funds in the account, to the  New  York
      city transit authority for mass transit within the city.

        ยง  11-2105  Returns.  a.  A  joint  return  shall be filed by both the
      grantor and the grantee for each deed  whether  or  not  a  tax  is  due
      thereon.  Such  return  shall  be filed with the commissioner of finance
      within thirty days after the delivery of the deed by the grantor to  the
      grantee  but  before  the  recording  of  such deed. The commissioner of
      finance may, by rule, require that such returns be filed electronically.
      Filing shall be accomplished by delivering the return  to  the  register
      for transmittal to the commissioner of finance or, where required by the
      commissioner  of finance, by electronic filing of the return in a manner
      designated by the commissioner of finance. In the case of a transfer  of
      an  economic interest in real property, a joint return shall be filed in
      the above manner by both the grantor and the grantee for each instrument
      or transaction by which such transfer is effected, whether or not a  tax
      is  due  thereon.  Such  return  shall be filed with the commissioner of
      finance, at such place and in such manner as he  or  she  may  designate
      within thirty days after the transfer. The commissioner of finance shall
      prescribe  the  form  of  the  return and the information which it shall
      contain. The return shall be signed by both the grantor or the grantor's
      agent and the grantee or the grantee's agent. Where the commissioner  of
      finance   requires   electronic  filing,  the  return  shall  be  signed
      electronically. Upon the filing of such return for a deed,  evidence  of
      the   filing  shall  be  affixed  to  the  deed  by  the  register.  The
      commissioner of finance may provide for the use of stamps as evidence of
      payment and that they  shall  be  affixed  to  the  deed  before  it  is
      recorded.  Where  either  the  grantor or grantee has failed to sign the
      return, it shall be accepted as a return, but the party who  has  failed
      to  sign  the  return  or file a separate return shall be subject to the
      penalties applicable to a person who has failed to file a return and the
      period of limitations for assessment of tax or of additional  tax  shall
      not apply to such party. For good cause, the commissioner of finance may
      waive any rule requiring electronic filing and may permit a return to be
      filed in such other manner as the commissioner of finance may designate.
        b. Returns shall be preserved for three years and thereafter until the
      commissioner of finance permits them to be destroyed.
        c. The commissioner of finance may require amended returns to be filed
      within twenty days after notice and to contain the information specified
      in the notice.
        d.  If  a  return required by this chapter is not filed or if a return
      when filed is incorrect or insufficient on its face the commissioner  of
      finance  shall  take the necessary steps to enforce the filing of such a
      return or of a corrected return.
        e. Where a deed, or  instrument  or  transaction  has  more  than  one
      grantor or more than one grantee, the return may be signed by any one of
      the  grantors  and  by  any one of the grantees, provided, however, that
      those not signing shall not be relieved of any  liability  for  the  tax
      imposed by this chapter.
        f.  The  payment  of, and the filing of returns relating to, the taxes
      imposed hereunder, shall be required as a  condition  precedent  to  the
      recording  or  filing of a deed, lease, assignment or surrender of lease
      or other instrument effecting a conveyance or transfer subject  to  such
      taxes.
        * (g)  Every cooperative housing corporation shall be required to file
      an information return with the commissioner of finance as follows:  such
      information  return shall be filed by February fifteenth of the year two
      thousand and of each year  thereafter,  covering  the  reporting  period
      beginning  on  January sixth of the year preceding the filing and ending
      on January fifth of the  year  of  the  filing.  For  reporting  periods
      beginning  before  January  sixth,  nineteen  hundred  ninety-nine, such
    
      information return shall  be  filed  by  July  fifteenth  of  each  year
      covering  the  preceding  period of January first through June thirtieth
      and by January fifteenth of each year covering the preceding  period  of
      July first through December thirty-first provided, however, that for the
      reporting  period  from  January  first through June thirtieth, nineteen
      hundred eighty-nine, such information return  shall  be  filed  by  July
      thirty-first,  nineteen  hundred  eighty-nine.  The return shall contain
      such information regarding the  transfer  of  shares  of  stock  in  the
      cooperative  housing corporation as the commissioner may deem necessary,
      including  but  not  limited  to,  the  names,  addresses  and  employer
      identification numbers or social security numbers of the grantor and the
      grantee,  the number of shares transferred, the date of the transfer and
      the consideration paid for such transfer,  provided,  however,  that  if
      such cooperative housing corporation elects that such information return
      be  deemed  an application for an abatement pursuant to paragraph (f) of
      subdivision three of section four  hundred  sixty-seven-a  of  the  real
      property  tax  law,  such  return shall contain the information required
      pursuant to paragraph (d) of subdivision  three  of  such  section.  The
      commissioner   of   finance   may  enter  into  an  agreement  with  the
      commissioner of taxation and finance of the state of New York to provide
      that a single information return may be filed for purposes  of  the  tax
      imposed  by  this  chapter  and  the real estate transfer tax imposed by
      article thirty-one of the tax law.

      such mortgage holder or its wholly owned subsidiary, shall not be liable
      as grantee for the tax determined to be due under this chapter from  the
      grantor  in such transfer, provided that such transfer occurred pursuant
      to, as the result of, or in connection with an  action,  proceeding,  or
      other  procedure  to  which  such  cooperative  housing corporation is a
      party, to enforce a lien, security interest or other  rights  on  or  in
      such  stock  and  proprietary  leasehold,  including  but not limited to
      rights under the proprietary lease.  This  subdivision  shall  apply  to

        ยง  11-2107  Determination of tax. If a return required by this chapter
      is not filed, or if a return when filed is  incorrect  or  insufficient,
      the amount of tax due shall be determined by the commissioner of finance
      from  such  information  as  may  be  obtainable, including the assessed
      valuation of the real property  or  interest  therein.  Notice  of  such
      determination  shall  be  given  to  the person liable for the tax. Such
      determination shall finally and  irrevocably  fix  the  tax  unless  the
      person  against whom it is assessed, within ninety days after the giving
      of notice of such determination, or, if the commissioner of finance  has
      established  a  conciliation procedure pursuant to section 11-124 of the
      code and  the  taxpayer  has  requested  a  conciliation  conference  in
      accordance   therewith,  within  ninety  days  from  the  mailing  of  a
      conciliation decision or the date of the commissioner's confirmation  of
      the  discontinuance  of  the  conciliation proceeding, both (1) serves a
      petition upon the commissioner of finance and (2) files a petition  with
      the  tax  appeals tribunal for a hearing, or, unless the commissioner of
      finance of his or her  own  motion  shall  redetermine  the  same.  Such
      hearing  and any appeal to the tax appeals tribunal sitting en banc from
      the decision rendered in such hearing shall be conducted in  the  manner
      and  subject  to the requirements prescribed by the tax appeals tribunal
      pursuant  to  sections  one  hundred  sixty-eight  through  one  hundred
      seventy-two  of the charter. After such hearing the tax appeals tribunal
      shall give notice of its decision to the person against whom the tax  is
      assessed  and  to  the  commissioner  of  finance. A decision of the tax
      appeals  tribunal  sitting  en  banc  shall  be  reviewable  for  error,
      illegality  or  unconstitutionality  or any other reason whatsoever by a
      proceeding under article seventy-eight of the  civil  practice  law  and
      rules if application therefor is made to the supreme court by the person
      against whom the tax was assessed within four months after the giving of
      the  notice  of  such  tax appeals tribunal decision. A proceeding under
      article seventy-eight of the civil practice law and rules shall  not  be
      instituted  by a taxpayer unless: (a) the amount of any tax sought to be
      reviewed, with penalties and interest thereon, if any,  shall  be  first
      deposited with the commissioner of finance and there shall be filed with
      the  commissioner  of finance an undertaking, issued by a surety company
      authorized to transact business  in  this  state  and  approved  by  the
      superintendent   of   insurance   of  this  state  as  to  solvency  and
      responsibility, in such amount and with such sureties as  a  justice  of
      the  supreme  court shall approve, to the effect that if such proceeding
      be dismissed or the tax confirmed, the taxpayer will pay all  costs  and
      charges which may accrue in the prosecution of the proceeding; or (b) at
      the  option of the taxpayer such undertaking filed with the commissioner
      of finance may be in a sum sufficient to cover the taxes, penalties  and
      interest  thereon  stated  in  such  decision plus the costs and charges
      which may accrue against it in the prosecution  of  the  proceeding,  in
      which  event  the  taxpayer shall not be required to deposit such taxes,
      penalties and interest as a condition precedent to the application.

Section 11-2108 ::    
        
     
        ยง  11-2108  Refunds.  a.  In  the  manner provided in this section the
      commissioner of finance shall refund or credit,  without  interest,  any
      tax,  penalty  or  interest erroneously, illegally or unconstitutionally
      collected or paid if application to the commissioner of finance for such
      refund shall be made within one year from the payment thereof.  Whenever
      a  refund  is  made  or  denied  by  the  commissioner  of  finance, the
      commissioner shall state his or her  reason  therefor  and  give  notice
      thereof  to the taxpayer in writing. Such application may be made by the
      grantor, grantee or other person who has  actually  paid  the  tax.  The
      commissioner  of finance may, in lieu of any refund required to be made,
      allow credit therefor on payments due from the applicant.
        b. Any determination of the commissioner of finance denying  a  refund
      or  credit  pursuant to subdivision a of this section shall be final and
      irrevocable unless the applicant  for  such  refund  or  credit,  within
      ninety days from the mailing of notice of such determination, or, if the
      commissioner   of  finance  has  established  a  conciliation  procedure
      pursuant  to  section  11-124  and  the  applicant   has   requested   a
      conciliation conference in accordance therewith, within ninety days from
      the mailing of a conciliation decision or the date of the commissioner's
      confirmation  of the discontinuance of the conciliation proceeding, both
      (1) serves a petition upon the commissioner of finance and (2)  files  a
      petition  with the tax appeals tribunal for a hearing. Such petition for
      a  refund  or  credit  made  as  herein  provided  shall  be  deemed  an
      application  for  a  revision of any tax, penalty or interest complained
      of. Such hearing and any appeal to the tax appeals tribunal  sitting  en
      banc  from  the  decision rendered in such hearing shall be conducted in
      the manner and subject to the requirements prescribed by the tax appeals
      tribunal pursuant  to  sections  one  hundred  sixty-eight  through  one
      hundred  seventy-two of the charter. After such hearing, the tax appeals
      tribunal shall give notice of its decision  to  the  applicant  and  the
      commissioner  of finance. The applicant shall be entitled to review such
      decision of the tax appeals tribunal sitting en  banc  by  a  proceeding
      pursuant  to  article seventy-eight of the civil practice law and rules,
      provided such proceeding is instituted  within  four  months  after  the
      giving  of  notice  of  such  decision,  and provided, in the case of an
      application by a taxpayer, that a final determination of tax due was not
      previously made. Such a proceeding shall not be instituted by a taxpayer
      unless an undertaking is filed with the commissioner of finance in  such
      amount  and  with  such sureties as a justice of the supreme court shall
      approve to the effect that if such proceeding be dismissed  or  the  tax
      confirmed,  the taxpayer will pay all costs and charges which may accrue
      in the prosecution of such proceeding.
        c. A person shall not be entitled to  a  revision,  refund  or  credit
      under  this  section  of  a  tax,  interest  or  penalty  which had been
      determined to be due pursuant to the provisions of  section  11-2107  of
      this  chapter  where he or she has had a hearing or an opportunity for a
      hearing, as provided in said section, or has failed to avail himself  or
      herself  of  the remedies therein provided. No refund or credit shall be
      made of a tax, interest or penalty paid after  a  determination  by  the
      commissioner of finance made pursuant to section 11-2107 of this chapter
      unless  it  be  found  that such determination was erroneous, illegal or
      unconstitutional or otherwise improper,  by  the  tax  appeals  tribunal
      after  a hearing, or on the commissioner of finance's own motion, or, if
      such tax appeals tribunal affirms in whole or in part the  determination
      of   the   commissioner  of  finance,  in  a  proceeding  under  article
      seventy-eight of the civil practice  law  and  rules,  pursuant  to  the
      provisions  of  said  section,  in  which event refund or credit without
    
      interest shall be made of the tax, interest or  penalty  found  to  have
      been overpaid.

      available  to any person for the review of tax liability imposed by this
      chapter; and no  determination  or  proposed  determination  of  tax  or
      determination  on  any  application  for  refund  shall  be  enjoined or
      reviewed by an action for declaratory judgment, an action for money  had
      and  received  or by any action or proceeding other than a proceeding in
      the nature of a certiorari proceeding under article seventy-eight of the
      civil practice law and rules; provided, however,  that  a  taxpayer  may
      proceed  by  declaratory  judgment  if  he or she institutes suit within
      thirty days after a deficiency assessment is made and pays the amount of
      the deficiency assessment to the commissioner of finance  prior  to  the
      institution  of  such  suit  and  posts  a bond for costs as provided in

---------------

Section 11-2111 ::    
        
     
        ยง  11-2111  Proceedings  to  recover  tax.  a. Whenever any grantor or
      grantee shall fail to pay any tax, penalty or interest imposed  by  this
      chapter  as  herein  provided,  the  corporation counsel shall, upon the
      request of the commissioner of finance bring or cause to be  brought  an
      action  to  enforce the payment of the same on behalf of the city of New
      York in any court of the state of New York or of any other state  or  of
      the  United  States.  If, however, the commissioner of finance in his or
      her discretion believes that any such grantor or grantee subject to  the
      provisions  of  this chapter is about to cease business, leave the state
      or remove or dissipate the assets out of which the tax or penalty  might
      be  satisfied,  and  that  any such tax or penalty will not be paid when
      due, such commissioner may declare such tax or penalty to be immediately
      due and payable and may issue a warrant immediately.
        b. As an additional or alternate remedy, the commissioner  of  finance
      may  issue a warrant, directed to the city sheriff commanding him or her
      to levy upon and sell the real and personal  property  of  the  grantor,
      grantee or other person liable for the tax which may be found within the
      city,  for  the  payment  of  the  amount  thereof, with any penalty and
      interest, and the cost of executing the  warrant,  and  to  return  such
      warrant  to  the  commissioner  of  finance and to pay to him or her the
      money collected by virtue thereof within sixty days after the receipt of
      such warrant. The city sheriff shall within five days after the  receipt
      of  the warrant file with the county clerk a copy thereof, and thereupon
      such clerk shall enter in the judgment docket the  name  of  the  person
      mentioned in the warrant and the amount of the tax, penalty and interest
      for  which  the  warrant is issued and the date when such copy is filed.
      Thereupon the amount of such warrant so docketed  shall  become  a  lien
      upon  the title to and the interest in real and personal property of the
      person against whom the warrant is issued. The city sheriff  shall  then
      proceed  upon  the  warrant in the same manner, and with like effect, as
      that provided by law in respect to executions  issued  against  property
      upon  judgments  of  a court of record and for services in executing the
      warrant he or she shall be entitled to the same fees, which such sheriff
      may collect in the same manner. In the discretion of the commissioner of
      finance a warrant of like terms, force and  effect  may  be  issued  and
      directed  to an officer or employee of the department of finance, and in
      the execution thereof such officer or employee shall have all the powers
      conferred by law upon sheriffs, but shall  be  entitled  to  no  fee  or
      compensation in excess of the actual expenses paid in the performance of
      such  duty.  If  a  warrant  is  returned  not  satisfied  in  full, the
      commissioner of finance may from time to time  issue  new  warrants  and
      shall  also  have the same remedies to enforce the amount due thereunder
      as if the city had recovered judgment therefor and execution thereon had
      been returned unsatisfied.
        c. The commissioner of finance, if he or she finds that the  interests
      of the city will not thereby be jeopardized, and upon such conditions as
      the  commissioner  of finance may require, may release any property from
      the lien of any  warrant  or  vacate  such  warrant  for  unpaid  taxes,
      additions to tax, penalties and interest filed pursuant to subdivision b
      of  this  section,  and  such  release or vacating of the warrant may be
      recorded in the office of any recording officer in  which  such  warrant
      has been filed. The clerk shall thereupon cancel and discharge as of the
      original date of docketing the vacated warrant.

      partly  within  and partly without the city of New York which is located
      within the city of New York or any interest therein;

      such  length of time as may be required for the proper administration of
      this chapter and to furnish such records to the commissioner of  finance
      upon request;

      production   of  books,  papers  and  documents  to  secure  information
      pertinent to the performance of the duties of the commissioner or of the

      any amount of tax is not paid on or before the last date prescribed  for
      payment  (without  regard to any extension of time granted for payment),
      interest on such amount at the rate set by the commissioner  of  finance
      pursuant  to  subdivision (g) of this section, or, if no rate is set, at
      the rate of seven and one-half percent per annum, shall be paid for  the
      period  from  such  last  date  to the date of payment. In computing the
      amount of interest to be paid, such interest shall be compounded  daily.
      Interest  under this subdivision shall not be paid if the amount thereof
      is less than one dollar.
        (b) * (1) Failure to file return. (A) In case of  failure  to  file  a
      return  under  this chapter on or before the prescribed date (determined
      with regard to any extension of time for filing),  unless  it  is  shown
      that  such  failure  is  due  to reasonable cause and not due to willful
      neglect, there shall be added to the amount required to be shown as  tax
      on  such return five percent of the amount of such tax if the failure is
      for not more than one month, with an additional five  percent  for  each
      additional   month   or  fraction  thereof  during  which  such  failure
      continues, not exceeding twenty-five percent in the aggregate.
        (B) In the case of a failure to file a return of tax within sixty days
      of the date prescribed for filing of such return (determined with regard
      to any extension of time for filing),  unless  it  is  shown  that  such
      failure  is  due to reasonable cause and not due to willful neglect, the
      addition to tax under subparagraph (A) of this paragraph  shall  not  be
      less  than  the  lesser of one hundred dollars or one hundred percent of
      the amount required to be shown as tax on such return. (C) For  purposes
      of  this paragraph, the amount of tax required to be shown on the return
      shall be reduced by the amount of any part of the tax which is  paid  on
      or  before  the date prescribed for payment of the tax and by the amount
      of any credit against the tax which may be claimed upon the return.

      amount  shown as tax on a return required to be filed under this chapter
      on or  before  the  prescribed  date  (determined  with  regard  to  any
      extension  of time for payment), unless it is shown that such failure is
      due to reasonable cause and not due to willful neglect, there  shall  be
      added  to the amount shown as tax on such return one-half of one percent
      of the amount of such tax if the failure is not for more than one month,
      with an additional one-half of one percent for each additional month  or
      fraction  thereof  during  which  such  failure continues, not exceeding
      twenty-five percent in the aggregate. For the purpose of  computing  the
      addition  for  any  month the amount of tax shown on the return shall be
      reduced by the amount of any part of the tax which is paid on or  before
      the  beginning of such month and by the amount of any credit against the
      tax which may be claimed upon the return. If the amount of tax  required
      to  be  shown  on  a return is less than the amount shown as tax on such
      return, this paragraph shall  be  applied  by  substituting  such  lower
      amount.
        (3)  Failure  to  pay  tax  required to be shown on return. In case of
      failure to pay any amount in respect of any tax required to be shown  on
      a  return  required to be filed under this chapter which is not so shown
      (including a determination made pursuant  to  section  11-2107  of  this
      chapter)  within  ten  days of the date of a notice and demand therefor,
      unless it is shown that such failure is due to reasonable cause and  not
      due to willful neglect, there shall be added to the amount of tax stated
      in  such  notice  and  demand one-half of one percent of such tax if the
      failure is not for more than one month, with an additional  one-half  of
      one  percent  for each additional month or fraction thereof during which
    
      such  failure  continues,  not  exceeding  twenty-five  percent  in  the
      aggregate.  For the purpose of computing the addition for any month, the
      amount of tax stated in the notice and demand shall be  reduced  by  the
      amount of any part of the tax which is paid before the beginning of such
      month.
        * (4) Limitations on additions.
        (A)  With  respect  to  any  return,  the amount of the addition under
      paragraph one of this subdivision shall be reduced by the amount of  the
      addition  under paragraph two of this subdivision for any month to which

      penalty under this subdivision.
        (f)  The  interest and penalties imposed by this section shall be paid

      Unpaid  interest and penalties may be enforced in the same manner as the

        (g) (1) Authority to set interest rates. The commissioner  of  finance
      shall set the rate of interest to be paid pursuant to subdivision (a) of
      this section, but if no such rate of interest is set, such rate shall be
      deemed  to  be  set  at  seven and one-half percent per annum. Such rate
      shall be the rate prescribed in paragraph two of  this  subdivision  but
      shall  not  be  less than seven and one-half percent per annum. Any such
      rate set by the commissioner of finance shall apply  to  taxes,  or  any
      portion  thereof,  which  remain  or  become due on or after the date on
      which such rate becomes effective and shall apply only with  respect  to
      interest  computed  or  computable  for  periods  or portions of periods
      occurring in the period in which such rate is in effect.
        (2) General rule. The rate of  interest  set  under  this  subdivision
      shall  be  the  sum of (i) the federal short-term rate as provided under
      paragraph three of this subdivision, plus (ii) seven percentage points.
        (3) Federal short-term rate. For purposes of this subdivision:
        (A) The federal short-term rate for any month  shall  be  the  federal
      short-term  rate  determined  by  the  United  States  secretary  of the
      treasury during such month in accordance with subsection (d) of  section
      twelve  hundred  seventy-four  of  the  internal revenue code for use in
      connection with section six  thousand  six  hundred  twenty-one  of  the
      internal  revenue  code.  Any  such rate shall be rounded to the nearest
      full percent (or, if a multiple of one-half of one  percent,  such  rate
      shall be increased to the next highest full percent).
        (B) Period during which rate applies.
        (i)   In   general.   Except  as  provided  in  clause  (ii)  of  this
      subparagraph, the federal short-term rate for the first  month  in  each
      calendar quarter shall apply during the first calendar quarter beginning
      after such month.
        (ii)  Special  rule  for  the  month  of  September,  nineteen hundred
      eighty-nine. The  federal  short-term  rate  for  the  month  of  April,
      nineteen  hundred  eighty-nine  shall  apply with respect to setting the
      rate  of  interest  for  the  month  of  September,   nineteen   hundred
      eighty-nine.
        (4)  Publication  of  interest rate. The commissioner of finance shall
      cause to be published in the city record,  and  give  other  appropriate
      general notice of, the interest rate to be set under this subdivision no
      later  than  twenty days preceding the first day of the calendar quarter
      during which such interest rate applies. The setting and publication  of
      such  interest  rate  shall  not  be  included  within  paragraph (a) of
      subdivision five of section one thousand forty-one of the  city  charter
      relating to the definition of a rule.
        * (h)  Miscellaneous.  (1)  The certificate of the commissioner to the
      effect that a tax has not been paid or that  information  has  not  been
      supplied pursuant to the provisions of this chapter shall be presumptive
      evidence thereof.

      corporation  fails  to  file  an  information  return   required   under
      subdivision  (g)  of  section  11-2105  of this chapter on or before the
      prescribed date (determined with regard to any  extension  of  time  for
    
      filing), unless it is shown that such failure is due to reasonable cause
      and  not  due  to  willful  neglect,  there  shall  be  imposed  on such
      cooperative housing corporation a penalty of  one  hundred  dollars  for
      each such failure.

        ยง 11-2116 Notices and limitations of time. a. Any notice authorized or
      required  under  the  provisions of this chapter may be given by mailing
      the same to the person for whom it is intended in  a  postpaid  envelope
      addressed  to  such person at the address given in the last return filed
      by him or her  pursuant  to  the  provisions  of  this  chapter  in  any
      application  made  by  him or her, or in any deed or instrument which is
      the subject  of  the  notice,  or,  if  no  return  has  been  filed  or
      application  made  or  address stated in the deed or instrument, then to
      such address as may be obtainable. The mailing of such notice  shall  be
      presumptive  evidence  of  the receipt of the same by the person to whom
      addressed. Any period of time  which  is  determined  according  to  the
      provisions of this chapter by the giving of notice shall commence to run
      from the date of mailing of such notice.
        b. The provisions of the civil practice law and rules or any other law
      relative  to  limitations  of time for the enforcement of a civil remedy
      shall not apply to any proceeding or action taken by the city  to  levy,
      appraise,  assess,  determine  or  enforce  the collection of any tax or
      penalty provided by this chapter. However,  except  in  the  case  of  a
      wilfully  false  or  fraudulent  return with intent to evade the tax, no
      assessment of additional tax shall be made after the expiration of  more
      than  three  years  from  the  date of the filing of a return; provided,
      however, that where no return has been filed as provided by law the  tax
      may be assessed at any time.
        c.  Where,  before  the expiration of the period prescribed herein for
      the assessment of an additional tax, a taxpayer has consented in writing
      that such period be extended, the amount of such additional tax due  may
      be  determined  at  any  time within such extended period. The period so
      extended may be further extended by subsequent consents in writing  made
      before the expiration of the extended period.
        d.  Except  as  otherwise provided in this subdivision, if any return,
      claim, statement, notice, application, or other document required to  be
      filed, or any payment required to be made, within a prescribed period or
      on  or before a prescribed date under authority of any provision of this
      chapter is, after such period or such date, delivered by  United  States
      mail  to  the commissioner of finance, the tax appeals tribunal, bureau,
      office, officer or person with which  or  with  whom  such  document  is
      required to be filed, or to which or to whom such payment is required to
      be  made, the date of the United States postmark stamped on the envelope
      shall be deemed to be the date of delivery. This subdivision shall apply
      only if the postmark date falls within the prescribed period  or  on  or
      before  the  prescribed  date  for  the  filing of such document, or for
      making the payment, including any extension granted for such  filing  or
      payment, and only if such document or payment was deposited in the mail,
      postage  prepaid, properly addressed to the commissioner of finance, the
      tax appeals tribunal, bureau, office, officer or person  with  which  or
      with  whom  the  document is required to be filed or to which or to whom
      such payment is required to be made. If any document is sent  by  United
      States  registered mail, such registration shall be prima facie evidence
      that such document was delivered to the commissioner of finance, the tax
      appeals tribunal, bureau, office, officer or person to which or to  whom
      addressed,  and  the  date  of registration shall be deemed the postmark
      date. The commissioner of finance and, where relevant, the  tax  appeals
      tribunal are authorized to provide by regulation the extent to which the
      provisions  of  the  preceding  sentence  with  respect  to  prima facie
      evidence of delivery and the postmark  date  shall  apply  to  certified
      mail.  Except  as  provided  in  subdivision  f  of  this  section, this
      subdivision shall apply in the case of postmarks not made by the  United
      States  postal  service only if and to the extent provided by regulation
    
      of the commissioner of finance  or,  where  relevant,  the  tax  appeals
      tribunal. Any return filed electronically shall be deemed to be filed on
      the date of issuance by the commissioner of finance of a confirmation.
        e.  When  the  last  day  prescribed  under  authority of this chapter
      (including any extension of time) for performing  any  act  falls  on  a
      Saturday,  Sunday or legal holiday in the state, the performance of such
      act shall be considered timely if it is performed on the next succeeding
      day which is not a Saturday, Sunday or legal holiday.
        f. (1) Any reference in subdivision d of this section  to  the  United
      States  mail  shall  be treated as including a reference to any delivery
      service designated by the secretary of the treasury of the United States
      pursuant to section seventy-five hundred two  of  the  internal  revenue
      code  and  any  reference  in  subdivision d of this section to a United
      States postmark shall be treated as including a reference  to  any  date
      recorded  or  marked  in  the  manner  described in section seventy-five
      hundred two of the  internal  revenue  code  by  a  designated  delivery
      service.  If the commissioner of finance finds that any delivery service
      designated by such secretary is inadequate for the needs  of  the  city,
      the  commissioner  of finance may withdraw such designation for purposes
      of this title. The commissioner of finance may also designate additional
      delivery services meeting the criteria of section  seventy-five  hundred
      two  of  the  internal  revenue  code for purposes of this title, or may
      withdraw any such designation if the commissioner of finance finds  that
      a  delivery  service  so  designated  is inadequate for the needs of the
      city. Any reference in subdivision d  of  this  section  to  the  United
      States  mail  shall  be treated as including a reference to any delivery
      service designated by the commissioner of finance and any  reference  in
      subdivision  d  of  this  section  to  a United States postmark shall be
      treated as including a reference to any date recorded or marked  in  the
      manner  described  in  section  seventy-five hundred two of the internal
      revenue code by a delivery service designated  by  the  commissioner  of
      finance. Notwithstanding the foregoing, any withdrawal of designation or
      additional  designation  by  the  commissioner  of  finance shall not be
      effective for purposes of service upon the tax appeals tribunal,  unless
      and  until  such  withdrawal of designation or additional designation is
      ratified by the president of the tax appeals tribunal.
        (2) Any equivalent of registered or certified mail designated  by  the
      United  States secretary of the treasury, or as may be designated by the
      commissioner of finance pursuant to  the  same  criteria  used  by  such
      secretary for such designations pursuant to section seventy-five hundred
      two  of  the internal revenue code, shall be included within the meaning
      of registered or certified  mail  as  used  in  subdivision  d  of  this
      section.  If  the  commissioner  of finance finds that any equivalent of
      registered or  certified  mail  designated  by  such  secretary  or  the
      commissioner  of  finance  is  inadequate for the needs of the city, the
      commissioner of finance may withdraw such designation  for  purposes  of
      this title. Notwithstanding the foregoing, any withdrawal of designation
      or  additional  designation  by the commissioner of finance shall not be
      effective for purposes of service upon the tax appeals tribunal,  unless
      and  until  such  withdrawal of designation or additional designation is
