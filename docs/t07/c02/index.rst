        ยง  7-202  Power  of comptroller to extend the time for commencement of
      suit upon claims.  Notwithstanding  any  other  provision  of  law,  the
      comptroller  may,  by  stipulation  in  writing,  agree  with a claimant
      against the city, the board of education or any community college of the
      city university of New York, to extend the  time  of  such  claimant  to

      aggregating more than six  months  after  the  expiration  of  the  time
      otherwise limited by law for the commencement of a suit upon such claim.
    
    
    
    
    
    
    

Section 7-203
-------------

Section 7-203 ::    
        
     
        ยง  7-203  Settlement  of  claims.  a.  The comptroller may require any
      person presenting for settlement an account or  claim,  except  a  claim
      with  regard to excise and non-property taxes, for any cause against the
      city or the board of education, to be sworn before the comptroller,  any
      of   the  deputy  comptrollers,  or  any  officer  or  employee  of  the
      comptroller's office or of the law department designated  in  a  written
      instrument  by  the  comptroller  and filed in the comptroller's office,
      touching such account or claim, and when so sworn, to answer  orally  as
      to  any  facts relative to the justness of such account or claim. Wilful
      false swearing before the comptroller, deputy comptroller or officer  or
      employee  designated  to  conduct  such  oral examination is perjury and
      punishable  as  such.  In  adjusting  and  settling  such  claims,   the
      comptroller,  as  far  as practicable, shall be governed by the rules of
      law and principles of equity which prevail in courts of justice.  Claims
      against  the  city  or  against any of the counties contained within its
      territorial limits, or payable in the first instance from moneys in  the
      city  treasury  for  services  rendered  or  work  done  or materials or
      supplies furnished, except:
        1. claims reduced to judgment, or
        2. awards, costs, charges and expenses duly taxed or ordered  paid  in
      judicial proceedings, or
        3.  claims  arising  under  the provisions of contracts made at public
      letting in the manner provided by chapter thirteen of  the  charter  and
      chapter one of title six of the code, or
        4.  claims  settled  and  adjusted by the comptroller, pursuant to the
      authority of this section,
        shall not be paid unless an auditor of accounts shall certify that the
      charges therefor are just and reasonable.
        b. Except as hereinbefore otherwise provided, all contracts  with  the
      city or any of such counties or with any public officer acting in its or
      their  behalf,  shall  be subject to audit by the comptroller. The power
      hereby given to settle and adjust such claims shall not be construed  to
      authorize   the   comptroller  to  dispute  the  amount  of  any  salary
      established by or under the  authority  of  any  officer  or  department
      authorized to establish the same, nor to question the due performance of
      duties  by  such  officer, except when necessary to prevent fraud. If in
      any action at law against the city to recover upon a claim not  embraced
      within  the  exceptions specified in subdivision a the amount claimed by
      the plaintiff is in excess of the amount so audited and settled  by  the
      comptroller,  the plaintiff must establish a claim by competent evidence
      of value, and no testimony shall  be  admitted  to  show  a  promise  or
      agreement  by  any  officer  or  employee  of  the city or of any of the
      counties contained within its territorial limits to pay any  larger  sum
      than the amount so audited or allowed by the comptroller.
    
    
    
    
    
    
    

Section 7-204
-------------

Section 7-204 ::    
        
     
        ยง  7-204 Settlement of claims. The commissioner of finance may require
      any person presenting for settlement a claim in relation to  excise  and
      non-property  taxes against the city to be sworn before the commissioner
      of finance, any of the deputy commissioners of finance, or  any  officer
      or  employee  of  the  department  of  finance  or of the law department
      designated in a written instrument by the commissioner  of  finance  and
      filed  in  the office of the commissioner, touching such claim, and when
      so sworn, to answer orally as to any facts relative to the  justness  of
      such  claim.  Wilful  false swearing before the commissioner of finance,
      any deputy commissioner or officer or  employee  designated  to  conduct
      such  oral  examination  is perjury and punishable as such. In adjusting
      and settling such  claims,  the  commissioner  of  finance,  as  far  as
      practicable,  shall  be  governed  by the rules of law and principles of
      equity which prevail in courts of justice.

Section 7-205 ::    
        
     
        ยง  7-205 Comptroller to audit charges against city for costs, etc. The
      comptroller, with the approval of the mayor, is authorized to audit  and
      allow,  as  charges against the city, the reasonable costs, counsel fees
      and expenses paid or incurred, or  which  shall  hereafter  be  paid  or
      incurred  by  any  commissioner  or  any  judge of the civil or criminal
      courts of the city of New York who shall have been a successful party in
      any proceeding or trial to remove him or her from office, or  who  shall
      bring  or  defend any action or proceeding, in which the question of his
      or her title to office is in any way presented or involved, or in  which
      it  is  sought  to convict him or her, or to review or prohibit any such
      removal or to obtain  possession  of  his  or  her  office,  or  by  any
      commissioner for the proper presentation and justification of his or her
      official  conduct before any body or tribunal lawfully investigating the
      same, and not officially recommending his or her removal from office.
    
    
    
    
    
    
    

Section 7-206
-------------

Section 7-206 ::    
        
     
        ยง  7-206  Illegal  claims;  power  of  board  of  estimate  to  pay or
      compromise on equitable grounds. The board of estimate may inquire into,
      hear and determine any claim against the city or  any  agency  when  the
      comptroller,  or  in the case of a claim against the board of education,
      the comptroller and the board of education, certifies  in  writing  that
      such  claim  is  illegal or invalid, but that it is equitable and proper
      that such claim be paid in whole or in part. If, upon such inquiry,  the
      board  of  estimate,  by a unanimous vote, determines that benefits have
      been received by the city or any agency and that public  interests  will
      best  be  served  by  payment  or  compromise  thereof, it may authorize
      payment of such claim, and such claim shall thereupon be  paid  in  such
      amount  as  the  board  shall determine to be just, in full satisfaction
      thereof, provided that the claimant shall execute a  release,  upon  any
      such  payment,  in  such  form  as  shall be approved by the corporation
      counsel. The provisions of this section shall not authorize the audit or
      payment of any claim barred by the statute of limitations, nor any claim
      for  services  performed  under  an  appointment  in  violation  of  any
      provision of the civil service law.

-------------

Section 7-207 ::    
        
     
        ยง  7-207  Payment of bonds upon which suit is barred by lapse of time.
      Notwithstanding any other provision of law, the  comptroller  shall  pay
      the principal and interest upon bonds or other evidences of indebtedness
      issued  by  the  city  within  twenty  years after a cause of action has
      accrued on said bonds or other evidences of indebtedness issued  by  the
      city  or  interest thereon, suit upon which may be barred by the statute
      of limitations.
    
    
    
    
    
    
    

Section 7-208
-------------

Section 7-208 ::    
        
     
        ยง  7-208  Claims  for  injuries caused by police while executing legal
      process  or  sustained  by  persons  injured  while  assisting  in   the
      apprehension  of  a criminal. a. The board of estimate may inquire into,
      hear and determine any claim against the city  wherein  compensation  is
      sought for the death of or injury to any person or persons:
        1. which shall have been caused by a police officer of the city, while
      such officer is engaged in arresting or endeavoring to arrest any person
      or  in  retaking  any  person  who has escaped from legal custody, or in
      executing any legal process, or
        2. which shall have been caused by any person who is engaged in or who
      is in the act of leaving the scene of the commission of a felony or  who
      is endeavoring to escape from a police officer or from legal custody, if
      such  death  was caused or injury received in assisting a police officer
      in the performance of the officer's duties.
        b. The board, by a unanimous vote, as a matter of grace and not  as  a
      matter  of  right, may award an amount recommended by the comptroller to
      be paid to the person or persons injured, or in the case of death to the
      person or persons who  would  be  entitled  to  distribution  under  the
      provisions  of  EPTL  5-4.4  or  any  amendments thereto. As a condition
      precedent, however, to consideration by the board, such  claim  must  be
      certified  in  writing  to the board by the comptroller as an illegal or
      invalid claim against the city, but which in the comptroller's  judgment
      it  is  equitable  and  proper  to  pay  in  the amount certified by the
      comptroller; and provided, further, that a written petition stating  all
      the  essential  facts in relation to such injury or death, signed by the
      injured person or persons, or in case of death by a  person  or  persons
      entitled  to  receive  the award or any part thereof, or by the personal
      representatives of a decedent,  shall  be  filed  with  the  comptroller
      within  six  months of the date of the occurrence which resulted in such
      injury or death. The provisions of this section shall not authorize  the
      audit or payment of any claim barred by the statute of limitations.

        ยง 7-209 Issuance of execution. Before execution may be issued upon any

      recovery of such judgment shall be given to the comptroller.

        ยง  7-210  Liability  of  real  property  owner for failure to maintain
      sidewalk in a reasonably safe condition. a. It shall be the duty of  the
      owner of real property abutting any sidewalk, including, but not limited
      to,  the  intersection  quadrant  for  corner property, to maintain such
      sidewalk in a reasonably safe condition.
        b. Notwithstanding any other provision  of  law,  the  owner  of  real
      property  abutting  any  sidewalk,  including,  but  not limited to, the
      intersection quadrant for corner  property,  shall  be  liable  for  any
      injury  to  property  or  personal  injury, including death, proximately
      caused by the failure of such owner  to  maintain  such  sidewalk  in  a
      reasonably  safe  condition.  Failure  to  maintain  such  sidewalk in a
      reasonably safe condition shall include, but  not  be  limited  to,  the
      negligent  failure to install, construct, reconstruct, repave, repair or
      replace defective sidewalk flags and the  negligent  failure  to  remove
      snow,  ice,  dirt  or other material from the sidewalk. This subdivision
      shall not apply to one-, two- or three-family residential real  property
      that  is  (i)  in  whole  or  in  part,  owner  occupied,  and (ii) used
      exclusively for residential purposes.
        c. Notwithstanding any other provision of law, the city shall  not  be
      liable  for  any injury to property or personal injury, including death,
      proximately caused by the failure  to  maintain  sidewalks  (other  than
      sidewalks  abutting one-, two- or three-family residential real property
      that is (i)  in  whole  or  in  part,  owner  occupied,  and  (ii)  used
      exclusively  for  residential  purposes) in a reasonably safe condition.
      This subdivision shall not be construed to apply to the liability of the
      city as a property owner pursuant to subdivision b of this section.
        d. Nothing in this section shall in any way affect the  provisions  of
      this  chapter  or of any other law or rule governing the manner in which
      an action or proceeding against the city  is  commenced,  including  any
      provisions requiring prior notice to the city of defective conditions.

      section  sixty-six of the general construction law or a state or federal
      agency or instrumentality, to which subdivision b of  section  7-210  of
      this code applies, shall be required to have a policy of personal injury
      and  property damage liability insurance for such property for liability
      for  any  injury  to  property  or  personal  injury,  including  death,
      proximately caused by the failure of such owner to maintain the sidewalk
      abutting  such  property  in a reasonably safe condition. The city shall
      not be liable for any injury to property or personal  injury,  including
      death,  as  a  result  of  the  failure  of an owner to comply with this
      section.
    
    
    
    
    
    
    

Section 7-212
-------------

Section 7-212 ::    
        
     
        ยง  7-212  Authority  to  make  payments for personal injury, including
      death, where abutting property owner liable pursuant to section 7-210 is
      uninsured. a. Where a judgment for  personal  injury,  including  death,
      obtained against an abutting property owner pursuant to section 7-210 of
      this  code  is  unsatisfied  for a period of at least one year following
      entry of such judgment in the office of the county clerk of  the  county
      in  which  such  property  is  situated and the judgment debtor has been
      determined by the comptroller after investigation to have no  policy  of
      liability  insurance  or  other  assets  to  satisfy  such judgment, the
      comptroller, after consultation with the corporation counsel, is  hereby
      authorized  and  empowered  to  make a payment for such personal injury,
      including death.
        b. Any such payment shall be made in the discretion of the comptroller
      and shall not be made as a matter of right. The amount of  such  payment
      shall  not  exceed  uncompensated  medical expenses. Payment may be in a
      single payment, or may be made in periodic payments. No such payment  or
      periodic  payments  shall  exceed  fifty  thousand dollars in total with
      respect to any unsatisfied judgment and the total of all  such  payments
      for  all  judgments  in  any  fiscal  year shall not exceed four million
      dollars.
        c. Petitions for a payment under this section shall  be  presented  to
      the  comptroller  not  less  than one or more than three years following
      entry of such judgment in the office of the county clerk of  the  county
      in  which such property is located. Each petition shall include evidence
      demonstrating (i)  that  efforts  to  collect  the  judgment  have  been
      pursued,  and  (ii)  that the judgment debtor has no policy of liability
      insurance or other assets to satisfy the judgment.
        d. Before the comptroller shall make such payment,  he  or  she  shall
      require  the  petitioner to execute an assignment of the judgment to the
      city. After assignment  the  city  shall  be  entitled  to  enforce  the
      judgment.  To the extent that the city collects money on the judgment in
      excess of the payment or payments made to a petitioner pursuant to  this
      section,  such  excess  amount  shall  be  paid  to the petitioner after
      deducting the city's expenses.
        e. No payment shall be made under this section  if  it  is  determined
      that  the unsatisfied judgment was obtained by fraud, or by collusion of
      the plaintiff and of any defendant in the action.
        f. The comptroller  shall,  by  rule,  establish  procedures  for  the
      presentation  of  petitions  for  payment  pursuant to the provisions of
      subdivision c of this section, for the review of such petitions by  that
      office  and  with  respect  to  such  other  matters as are necessary to
      implement the provisions of this section.
