      completing the indexing belonging to the preceding  year.  A  new  block
      index  shall  thereupon be opened for every such altered or new block in

      entries  relating  to  land in such altered or new blocks. At the end of
      each block index so closed, a reference shall be made to the  new  block
      index.
        d.  Daily  block  indices.  On  and after July first, nineteen hundred

      respectively refer, and shall be  notice  to  subsequent  purchasers  or
      incumbrancers  to  the same extent and with like effect as the recording
