      receipt  requested,  to one of the owners of some part of or interest in

      the county clerk, as the case may be, shall be presumed to be the  owner
      thereof.
        (g)  Presumption  of  employment or agency. Whenever there is evidence
      that a person was the manager, operator, supervisor  or,  in  any  other
      way,  in charge of the premises, at the time a public nuisance was being
      conducted, maintained or permitted, such evidence shall  be  presumptive

      upon  a  motion  for summary judgment in an action under this chapter, a
      finding  is  made  that  the  defendant  has  intentionally   conducted,
      maintained  or  permitted  a  public nuisance defined in this chapter, a
      penalty, to be included in the judgment, may be awarded in an amount not
      to exceed one thousand dollars  for  each  day  it  is  found  that  the
      defendant  intentionally  conducted,  maintained or permitted the public
    
      nuisance.  Upon recovery, such penalty shall be paid  into  the  general
      fund of the city.

      council,  the  order  shall  be enforced by the agency designated by the
      mayor. The police department shall,  upon  the  request  of  the  agency
      involved  or  upon the direction of the mayor, assist in the enforcement

      without notice, pending order of the  court  granting  or  refusing  the

      safety or welfare immediately requires a  temporary  restraining  order,
      such   temporary   restraining  order  may  be  granted  without  notice
      restraining the defendants and all  persons  from  removing  or  in  any
      manner  interfering  with  the  furniture, fixtures and movable property
      used in conducting, maintaining or permitting the  public  nuisance  and

      orders.
        (b)  Enforcement of temporary closing orders and temporary restraining
      orders. Temporary closing orders shall be  enforced  by  the  agency  at

      closing  order  has  been  granted,  the  officers  shall  affix,  in  a
      conspicuous  place  or  upon  one  or  more  of  the  principal doors at
      entrances of such premises, a printed notice that the premises have been
      closed by court order, which notice shall contain the legend "closed  by

Section 7-714 ::    
        
     
        §  7-714  Permanent  injunction.  (a)  A judgment awarding a permanent
      injunction pursuant to this subchapter may direct the sheriff  to  seize
      and  remove from the building, erection or place all material, equipment
      and instrumentalities used in the creation and maintenance of the public
      nuisance and shall direct the sale by the sheriff of  such  property  in
      the  manner  provided  for the sale of personal property under execution
      pursuant to the provisions of the civil practice law and rules. The  net
      proceeds  of  any  such  sale,  after  deduction  of the lawful expenses
      involved, shall be paid into the general fund of the city.
        (b) A judgment  awarding  a  permanent  injunction  pursuant  to  this
      subchapter  may  authorize  agents  of  the city to forthwith remove and
      correct construction and structural alterations as provided  in  section
      26-246 of this code.
        (c)  A  judgment  awarding  a  permanent  injunction  pursuant to this
      subchapter may direct the closing of the building, erection or place  by
      the  sheriff,  to  the extent necessary to abate the nuisance, and shall
      direct the sheriff to post a copy of the judgment and a  printed  notice
      of  such  closing  conforming  to the requirements of subdivision (e) of
      section 7-711 of this subchapter. Mutilation or removal of such a posted
      judgment or notice while it remains in force, in addition to  any  other
      punishment  prescribed  by law, shall be punishable, on conviction, by a
      fine of not more than two hundred fifty dollars or by  imprisonment  not
      exceeding  fifteen  days,  or  by  both, provided such judgment contains
      therein a notice of such penalty. The closing directed by  the  judgment
      shall  be  for such period as the court may direct but in no event shall
      the closing be for a period of more than one year from  the  posting  of
      the judgment provided for in this subdivision. If the owner shall file a
      bond in the value of the property ordered to be closed and submits proof
      to  the court that the nuisance has been abated and will not be created,
      maintained or permitted  for  such  period  of  time  as  the  building,
      erection  or  place  has been directed to be closed in the judgment, the
      court may vacate the provisions of the judgment that direct the  closing
      of the building, erection or place. A closing by the sheriff pursuant to
