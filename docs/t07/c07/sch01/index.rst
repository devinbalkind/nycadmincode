Section 7-701 ::    
        
     
        ยง  7-701  Legislative declaration. The council of the city of New York
      finds that public nuisances exist  in  the  city  of  New  York  in  the
      operation of certain commercial establishments and the use or alteration
      of   property  in  flagrant  violation  of  the  building  code,  zoning
      resolution, health laws, multiple dwelling law,  penal  laws  regulating
      obscenity,   prostitution   and   related   conduct,   licensing   laws,
      environmental laws,  laws  relating  to  the  sale  and  consumption  of
      alcoholic  beverages,  laws  relating to gambling, controlled substances
      and dangerous drugs and penal laws relating to the possession of  stolen
      property,  all of which interfere with the interest of the public in the
      quality of life and total community environment, the tone of commerce in
      the city, property values and the public health,  safety,  and  welfare;
      the  council  further  finds  that  the  continued  occurrence  of  such
      activities and violations is detrimental  to  the  health,  safety,  and
      welfare  of  the  people  of  the city of New York and of the businesses
      thereof and visitors thereto. It is the purpose of the council to create
      one standardized procedure for securing  legal  and  equitable  remedies
      relating  to  the  subject  matter  encompassed  by  this  law,  without
      prejudice  to  the  use  of  procedures  available  under  existing  and
      subsequently  enacted  laws,  and  to  strengthen  existing  laws on the
      subject.
