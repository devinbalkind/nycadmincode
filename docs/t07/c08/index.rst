Section 7-804.
--------------

Section 7-804. ::    
        
     
        ยง 7-804. Civil actions for false claims. a. If the corporation counsel
      finds  that  a  person  has  violated  or is violating the provisions of
      section 7-803  of  this  chapter,  he  or  she  may  institute  a  civil
      enforcement  action  against  that  person  in  any  court  of competent
      jurisdiction.
        b. 1. Any person may submit a proposed civil  complaint  to  the  city
      alleging violations of section 7-803. Proposed civil complaints shall be
      signed  and  verified  and  shall  include  all  material  evidence  and
      information possessed by such person in support of  the  allegations  in
      such  proposed  civil  complaints. The city shall diligently investigate
      all such proposed civil complaints. The city may request such additional
      information as it deems necessary from the person submitting a  proposed
      civil complaint.
        2. The corporation counsel and the commissioner of investigation shall
      promulgate  rules  establishing  a  protocol detailing the procedures by
      which the city will address proposed civil complaints  after  they  have
      been submitted, which protocol shall include the requirement that within
      one  hundred  eighty  days of receipt of a proposed civil complaint, the
      city shall, in writing, notify the person  who  submitted  the  proposed
      civil complaint that the corporation counsel:
        (i)  intends to commence a civil enforcement action based on the facts
      alleged in the proposed civil complaint  against  one  or  more  of  the
      defendants  named  in  the proposed civil complaint, in which case he or
      she shall commence such action within ninety days of such  notification,
      provided  that  if  the  corporation  counsel determines that a delay in
      commencing  such  action  is  warranted,  he  or  she  may  delay   such
      commencement, upon notice to the person who submitted the proposed civil
      complaint,  for  an additional ninety days at which time he or she shall
      commence such action;
        (ii) designates the person or, if the person is not an  attorney,  the
      attorney  of such person, as a special assistant corporation counsel for
      purposes of filing a civil enforcement action against one or more of the
      defendants named in the proposed civil complaint; or
        (iii) declines to commence a civil  enforcement  action  or  designate
      such  person  to  commence  a civil enforcement action in which case the
      corporation counsel shall state in the notification its reason for doing
      so.
        3. The corporation counsel shall commence a civil  enforcement  action
      or  designate  the person who submitted the proposed civil complaint or,
      if the person is not an attorney, his or her  attorney,  to  commence  a
      civil enforcement action unless:
        (i)  the  proposed civil complaint is barred for the reasons set forth
      in subdivision d of this section;
        (ii) the corporation counsel has determined that  the  proposed  civil
      complaint  is based upon an interpretation of law or regulation which if
      adopted, would result in significant cost to the city;
        (iii) the corporation counsel has determined that commencing  a  civil
      enforcement  action  would  interfere  with  a  contractual relationship
      between the city and an entity providing goods or services  which  would
      significantly  interfere  with  the  provision  of  important  goods  or
      services, or would jeopardize the health and safety of the public; or
        (iv) the corporation counsel has determined  that  the  complaint,  if
      filed  in  a  court  of  competent  jurisdiction, would be dismissed for
      failure to state a claim upon which relief may be based.
        c. If the  commissioner  of  investigation  determines  that  a  civil
      enforcement  action may interfere with or jeopardize an investigation by
      a governmental agency, then  the  corporation  counsel  may  decline  to
      commence  a civil enforcement action based on a proposed civil complaint
    
      or to designate the person who submitted such proposed  civil  complaint
      to  commence such action, provided that the corporation counsel notifies
      the  person  who  submitted  the  proposed  civil  complaint   of   such
      determination within ninety days of receipt by the city of such proposed
      civil  complaint and every one hundred eighty days thereafter until such
      time as the commissioner of investigation  determines  that  such  civil
      enforcement  action  would  no  longer  interfere  with  or jeopardize a
      governmental investigation, at which time the corporation counsel  shall
      provide   to  the  person  who  submitted  the  proposed  complaint  the
      notification required in paragraph two of subdivision b of this section.
      The determination by the commissioner of investigation shall be final.
        d. Certain actions barred. This section shall  not  apply  to  claims,
      records,  or statements made pursuant to federal, state or local tax law
      nor to any proposed civil complaints:
        1. based upon one or more false claims with a cumulative value of less
      than twenty five thousand dollars;
        2. based upon allegations or transactions which are the subject of any
      pending criminal or  civil  action  or  proceeding,  including  a  civil
      enforcement  action,  or  an  administrative action in which the city is
      already a party;
        3. if substantially the same allegations or transactions as alleged in
      the proposed complaint were publicly disclosed
        (i) in a criminal, civil or administrative hearing;
        (ii) in a legislative or  administrative  report,  hearing,  audit  or
      investigation; or
        (iii)  by  the  news media and likely to be seen by the city officials
      responsible for addressing false claims;
      unless the person who submitted the proposed complaint  is  an  original
      source  of  the  information. The corporation counsel may, in his or her
      absolute discretion, waive the application of this paragraph.
        4. based upon information discovered by an employee of the city, state
      or federal government in the course of his or her employment unless: (i)
      such employee first reported  such  information  to  the  department  of
      investigation; and (ii) the city failed to act on the information within
      six months of its receipt by the department of investigation; or
        5.  against the federal government, the state of New York, the city or
      any  officer  or  employee  acting  within  the  scope  of  his  or  her
      employment.
        e.  Nothing herein shall be construed as authorizing anyone other than
      the corporation counsel and a person or attorney authorized pursuant  to
      this  chapter  to  commence  a civil enforcement action to represent the
      city of New York in legal proceedings.
        f.  Pending  and  related  actions.  1.  No  person,  other  than  the
      corporation  counsel, may intervene or bring a related action based upon
      the facts underlying a  civil  enforcement  action,  unless  such  other
      person  has  first obtained the permission of the corporation counsel to
      intervene or to bring such related action.
        2. Regardless of whether the corporation counsel has commenced a civil
      enforcement action or another party has been designated to  do  so,  the
      city  may  elect  to  pursue  any  alternate  action with respect to the
      presentation of false claims, provided that the person who submitted the
      proposed civil complaint upon which such alternate action is  based,  if
      any, shall be entitled to the same percentage share of any cash proceeds
      recovered by the city as such person would have been entitled to if such
      alternate action was a civil enforcement action.
        g.  Rights  of  the  parties.  1. If the corporation counsel elects to
      commence a civil enforcement action, then the city shall have  the  sole
      authority   for  prosecuting,  and,  subject  to  the  approval  of  the
    
      comptroller, settling the action and may move to dismiss the action,  or
      may  settle  the action notwithstanding the objections of the person who
      submitted the proposed civil complaint upon which such civil enforcement
      action is based.
        2.  If  a  person  who  submitted  a  proposed complaint or his or her
      attorney has been designated to commence  a  civil  enforcement  action,
      then  the  corporation  counsel  and  such authorized person or attorney
      shall share authority for prosecuting the case. However, the corporation
      counsel may move to dismiss the action notwithstanding the objection  of
      the  person  who  submitted  the  proposed civil complaint provided such
      person has been served with an appropriate  motion  and  the  court  has
      provided  such  person  with an opportunity to be heard. The corporation
      counsel may also, subject to the approval of the comptroller, settle the
      action notwithstanding the objection of the  person  who  submitted  the
      proposed  civil  complaint  if the court determines after providing such
      person with an opportunity to be heard, that the proposed settlement  is
      fair, adequate, and reasonable.
        3.  The  corporation  counsel may apply to the court for and the court
      may issue an order restricting the participation of a person  designated
      to   commence   a   civil   enforcement   action   in   such  litigation
      notwithstanding the objections of such person if the  court  determines,
      after  providing  such  person  an  opportunity  to  be heard, that such
      person's unrestricted participation during the course of the  litigation
      would  interfere  with  or  unduly delay the prosecution of the case, or
      would be repetitious or irrelevant, or upon a showing by  the  defendant
      that  such  person's unrestricted participation during the course of the
      litigation would be for  purposes  of  harassment  or  would  cause  the
      defendant  undue burden.  Such restrictions may include, but need not be
      limited to: (i) limiting the number of witnesses such person  may  call,
      (ii)  limiting  the  length  of  the  testimony of such witnesses, (iii)
      limiting such person's cross-examination of witnesses, or (iv) otherwise
      limiting such person's participation in the litigation.
        4. The corporation counsel may apply to the court for a  stay  of  any
      civil  enforcement action if it will interfere with any investigation or
      prosecution of a criminal matter arising out of the same facts.
        h. Under no circumstances shall the city be  bound  by  an  act  of  a
      person designated to commence a civil enforcement action.
        i.  Awards from proceeds. 1. If the corporation counsel has elected to
      commence a civil enforcement action based on a proposed civil complaint,
      then the person or persons who submitted such proposed  civil  complaint
      collectively   shall   be   entitled  to  receive  between  fifteen  and
      twenty-five percent of the proceeds recovered in such civil  enforcement
      action  or  in settlement of such action. Where the court finds that the
      action was based primarily on disclosures of specific information (other
      than information provided by the person bringing the action) relating to
      allegations or transactions  in  a  criminal,  civil  or  administrative
      hearing,  in  a  legislative or administrative report, hearing, audit or
      investigation, or from the news media, the court may award such sums  as
      it  considers  appropriate,  but in no case more than ten percent of the
      proceeds, taking into account the significance of  the  information  and
      the  role  of  the  person  or  persons who submitted the proposed civil
      complaint in advancing the case to litigation.
        2. If a person, or such  person's  attorney  has  been  designated  to
      commence  a  civil  enforcement  action  based on such person's proposed
      civil complaint, then such person shall be entitled to  receive  between
      twenty-five  and  thirty percent of the proceeds recovered in such civil
      enforcement action or in settlement of such action.
    
        3. The court shall determine the share of  the  proceeds  to  which  a
      person  submitting  a  proposed complaint is entitled, and may take into
      account the following factors:
        (i)  the  extent  to which the person who submitted the proposed civil
      complaint contributed to the prosecution of the action, either in  time,
      effort or finances;
        (ii)  whether  the  civil  enforcement  action  was based primarily on
      information provided by the person  who  submitted  the  proposed  civil
      complaint,  rather  than information derived from public sources such as
      allegations or transactions  in  a  criminal,  civil  or  administrative
      hearing,  in  a  legislative or administrative report, hearing, audit or
      investigation, or from the news media;
        (iii) any unreasonable delay by such person in submitting the proposed
      civil complaint;
        (iv) the extent to which the allegations involve a significant  safety
      issue;
        (v) whether the person who submitted the proposed civil complaint that
      formed the basis of the civil enforcement action initiated the violation
      of  section  7-803 of this chapter alleged in such action, in which case
      the percentage share of the proceeds of  the  action  that  such  person
      would  otherwise  receive  under  this  section may be reduced below the
      minimum percentages  set  forth  in  paragraphs  one  and  two  of  this
      subdivision,  taking  into  account the role of such person in advancing
      the case to litigation and any relevant  circumstances  including  those
      pertaining to the violation;
        (vi)  whether  the  person  who submitted the proposed civil complaint
      that formed the basis of the civil enforcement action has  been  charged
      with  criminal  conduct  arising  from  his  or  her role in the alleged
      violation of section 7-803 of this chapter, in which  case  such  person
      shall  not  receive any share of the proceeds of the action if convicted
      on such charges; and
        (vii) fundamental fairness  and  any  other  factors  the  corporation
      counsel and the court deem appropriate.
        j.  Costs,  expenses  and attorneys' fees. 1. In any civil enforcement
      action commenced pursuant to this chapter, the corporation counsel, or a
      person  designated  to  commence  such  civil  enforcement  action,   if
      applicable,  may  apply  for  an  amount  of  reasonable  expenses, plus
      reasonable attorneys' fees, plus costs. Costs and expenses shall include
      costs incurred by the department of investigation in  investigating  the
      false claim and prosecuting conduct relating thereto. All such expenses,
      attorneys'  fees  and  costs  shall  be  awarded  directly  against  the
      defendant and shall not be charged from the proceeds, but shall only  be
      awarded if the city prevails in the action
        2. In a civil enforcement action commenced by a designated person or a
      such  person's  attorney  the  defendant  may  apply  for  an  amount of
      reasonable expenses, plus reasonable attorneys' fees, plus costs and the
      court  may  award  such  expenses,  attorneys'  fees  and  costs  if  it
      determines  that  such  civil enforcement action was frivolous. All such
      expenses, attorneys' fees and costs shall be  awarded  directly  against
      the person or person's attorney that commenced the action.
        k.  The  city shall not be liable for any expenses, attorneys' fees or
      costs that a person or  a  person's  attorney  incurs  in  submitting  a
      proposed civil complaint or commencing or litigating a civil enforcement
      action pursuant to this section.
