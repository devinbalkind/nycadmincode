      to acquire by condemnation any real estate or any interest therein  that
      may  be necessary in order to acquire the sole and exclusive property in

      rights   that   at  the  time  of  the  initiation  of  proceedings  for
      condemnation are in actual use for the supply of the waterworks  of  the
      people  of  any  other  city,  town  or village of the state, or for the
      supply and distribution of waters to the people thereof, or which in the
      opinion of the court on such proceedings may reasonably become necessary
      for such supply, or to take or use the water from any of the  canals  of
      the  state,  any canal reservoirs, or waters used exclusively as feeders
      for canals, or from any  of  the  streams  acquired  by  the  state  for
      supplying the canals with water.

      in Putnam county which has been  used  for  twenty-five  years  for  the
      manufacture  of  food  products;  nor acquire by condemnation any lands,
      easements, streams or water, or water rights, on the east branch of  the
      Croton  river,  below  the village of Brewster in the town of Southeast,

Section 5-356

Section 5-356 ::    
        
     
        § 5-356 Acquisition of real estate used for railroad, highway or other
      public  purpose.  a.  The  persons  or  corporations owning real estate,
      heretofore or hereafter acquired or used for railroad, highway or  other
      public  purpose,  or  claiming  interest  therein  shall  be allowed the
      perpetual use, for such purposes, of the same  or  of  such  other  real
      estate  to  be  acquired for the purposes of this title as will afford a
      practicable route or location for such railroad, highway or other public
      purpose, and in the case of a railroad, commensurate with and adapted to
      its needs.
        b. Such persons or corporations shall not directly or  indirectly,  be
      subject  to  expense, loss or damage by reason of changing such route or
      location, but such expense, loss or damage shall be borne by the city.
        c. In case such real  estate  shall  be  taken  or  affected  for  the
      purposes  of  this  subchapter,  there shall be designated upon the maps
      referred to in this subchapter, and there  shall  be  described  in  the
      petition  referred  to,  such portion of the other real estate shown, on
      such maps and described in such petition, as it  shall  be  proposed  to
      substitute  in  place  of  the  real estate then used for such railroad,
      highway or other public purposes. The supreme court, at the special term
      to which the petition is presented, or at such other special term as the
      consideration thereof may be noticed for, or adjourned to, shall  either
      approve  the  substituted  route or place, or refer the same back to the
      commissioner for alteration or amendment. The court may refer  the  same
      back  with such directions, or suggestions as it may deem advisable, and
      as often as necessary, and until the commissioner shall  determine  such
      substituted  route  or place as may be approved by such court. An appeal
      from any order made by the court at special term, under  the  provisions
      of  this section may be taken by any person or corporation interested in
      and aggrieved  thereby,  to  the  appellate  division  of  the  judicial
      department in which the real estate is situated, and shall be heard as a
      non-enumerated motion.
        d.  A  justice  of  the  supreme court before whom the proceedings are
      brought, in determining the compensation to be made to  the  persons  or
      corporations  owning  such  real  estate,  or claiming interest therein,
      shall include in the amount of such compensation such sum  as  shall  be
      sufficient  to  defray  the  expenses of making such change of route and
      location and of building such railroad or highway. The court, subject to
      review by the appellate division, shall determine what  reasonable  time
      after  payment  of  the  awards  to the persons or corporations entitled
      thereto shall be sufficient within which to complete the work of  making
      such  change. The city or the commissioner shall not be entitled to take
      possession or interfere with the use  of  such  real  estate,  for  such
      purposes, before the expiration of such time. That time may subsequently
      be extended by the court (subject to such review), upon sufficient cause
      shown.  After  the  expiration of the time so determined or extended, no
      use shall be made of such real estate which shall cause pollution of the
      water in any reservoir, or interfere with its flow.

      of the real estate which in his  or  her  opinion  it  is  necessary  to
      acquire  for  such  purposes, and shall submit the same to the mayor for
      approval. The mayor may adopt, modify or reject such maps in whole or in
      part, and may require others to be made instead.
        b. A copy of the map or maps so prepared, with a  certificate  of  the
      adoption  thereof,  signed  by  the commissioner and the mayor, shall be
      filed in  the  office  of  such  commissioner  and  be  open  to  public
      inspection,  and  shall  be  the  map  or  maps of the real estate to be
      acquired, subject to such changes or modifications as  the  commissioner

      hearings, testimony may be produced by the parties appearing  before  it
      in  such  manner  as  the  mayor  may determine, and he or she is hereby
      authorized  to  administer  oaths  and  issue  subpoenas  in  any   such
      proceeding pending before him or her.

Section 5-359 ::    
        
     
        §  5-359  Entry  upon lands to make maps. The commissioner, his or her
      agents, engineers, surveyors, and such other persons as may be necessary

Section 5-360
-------------

Section 5-360 ::    
        
     
        §  5-360  Damage  maps;  preparation and filing of. a. After the final
      adoption of such map or maps, the commissioner shall prepare six similar
      maps or plans of the proposed site  of  any  dam,  reservoir,  aqueduct,
      sluice,  culvert,  canal,  pumping  works,  bridges, tunnels, blow-offs,
      ventilating shafts, and other necessary  appurtenances  for  the  proper
      completion  of  the work so proposed by the commissioner. Upon such maps
      there shall be:
        1. Laid out and numbered the various parcels of real estate, on,  over
      or through which the same are to be constructed and maintained, or which
      may  be  necessary  for  the  prosecution of the work authorized by this
      subchapter.

      the surface of the soil at the time of the survey.
        3.  Plainly  indicated  thereon,  of  which  parcels  the fee or other
      interest is to be acquired.
        b. Such maps may be made and filed in sections. One or  more  sections
      may  be  determined  before  the  maps  of  the  whole  construction are
      completed.  The proceedings herein authorized may,  in  like  manner  be
      taken  separately,  in reference to one or more of such sections, before
      the maps of the whole are filed. The work  upon  one  or  more  of  such
      sections  may  be  begun  before  the maps of the remaining sections are
      filed. The map or maps, when adopted  by  the  commissioner  and  mayor,
      shall  be  by  such commissioner transmitted to the corporation counsel,
      with a certificate  of  approval  written  thereon  and  signed  by  the
      commissioner and the mayor.
        c. The corporation counsel shall cause one of such maps to be filed in
      the office of the clerk of each county in which any real estate laid out
      on  such maps shall be located, except that in any county in which there
      may be a register's office, such map shall be filed therein, instead  of
      with  the  county  clerk.  The  fourth,  fifth  and  sixth maps shall be
      disposed of in the manner indicated in section 5-366 of this subchapter.
    
    
    
    
    
    
    

Section 5-361
-------------

Section 5-361 ::    
        
     
        § 5-361 Agreements with owners of real estate or other persons. a. The
      commissioner,  subject  to the approval of the mayor, may agree with the
      owners or persons interested in any real estate laid down on  such  maps
      upon  the  amount  of  compensation to be paid to such owners or persons
      interested for the taking or using and occupying such  real  estate.  In
      case  any  such  real  estate shall be owned, occupied or enjoyed by the
      people of this state, or by any county, town or school  district  within
      this state, such rights, titles, interests or properties may be paid for
      upon  agreement  respectively  with the New York State office of general
      services, who shall act for the people of the state, with a  chairperson
      and a majority in numbers of the board of supervisors of any county, who
      shall  act for such county, and with the supervisor and commissioners of
      highways in any town, who shall act for such town, and with the trustees
      of any school district, who shall act for such district,  and  with  the
      president  and  a  majority of the board of trustees of any incorporated
      village. The New York State office of general services shall have  power
      to  grant  to  the  city any real estate belonging to the people of this
      state  which  may  be  required  for  the  purposes  indicated  in  this
      subchapter,  on  such  terms  as  may be agreed on between them and such
      commissioners. If any real estate of any county, town or school district
      is required by the  city  for  the  purposes  of  this  subchapter,  the
      majority  of  the  board  of supervisors, acting for such county, or the
      supervisors of  any  such  town,  with  the  commissioners  of  highways
      therein,  acting  for such town, or the trustees of any school district,
      acting for such district, or the president and majority of  trustees  of
      any  incorporated  village,  may grant or surrender such real estate for
      the compensation agreed upon between such officers respectively and such
      commissioners.
        b. In case any real estate required by the city  for  the  purpose  of
      this  subchapter  shall be vested in any trustee not authorized to sell,
      release and convey the same, or in  any  infant,  idiot,  or  person  of
      unsound  mind,  the  supreme  court  shall  have  power,  by  a  summary
      proceeding, on petition,  to  authorize  and  empower  such  trustee  or
      general  guardian  or  committee  of  such  infant,  idiot, or person of
      unsound mind, to sell, convey, or surrender the same to the city on such
      terms as may be just. In case any  such  infant,  idiot,  or  person  of
      unsound mind has no general guardian or committee, the court may appoint
      a  special  guardian  or  committee for the purpose of making such sale,
      surrender, or conveyance,  and  may  require  such  security  from  such
      general  or special guardian or committee as such court may deem proper.
      Before any conveyance or release authorized by this subchapter shall  be
      executed,  the  terms  on  which  the  same  shall  be executed shall be
      reported to the court on oath, and if the court shall be satisfied  that
      such  terms  are  just  to  the party interested in such rights, titles,
      interests, or properties, the court shall confirm the report and  direct
      to  be  executed  the proper conveyance or release, which shall have the
      same effect as if executed by an owner of such rights, titles, interests
      or properties having legal power to  sell,  surrender,  and  convey  the
      same.
        c.  In  case  any person owning private property not actually taken or
      proposed to be taken, pursuant to the provisions of this subchapter, but
      which will  in  such  person's  opinion  be  damaged,  the  commissioner
      representing  the  city,  with the approval of the mayor, may agree with
      such person as to the amount of such  damages,  and  if  such  agreement
      cannot  be  made,  such damages, if any, shall be determined in the same
      manner provided for ascertaining  and  determining  the  value  of  real
      estate  taken  under such proceedings, and the amount of such damages so
      agreed upon or so determined shall be payable  and  collectible  in  the
    
      same  manner  as  is  provided  in  the  case  of  awards  made  in such
      proceedings.

        §  5-362  Institution  of proceedings. After such maps shall have been
      filed, as  provided  for  in  section  5-360  of  this  subchapter,  the
      corporation  counsel,  upon  first giving the notice required in section

      special term thereof to be held in the judicial district  in  which  the

      shall  in addition to the other requirements of section four hundred two
      of the eminent domain procedure law, present to the  court  a  petition,
      signed  and  verified  by  the  commissioner,  setting  forth the action
      theretofore taken by such commissioner and the mayor, and the filing  of
      such  maps. Such petition shall contain a general description of all the
      real estate to, in or over which any title, interest, right or  easement
      is  sought  to  be  acquired  for  the  city  for  the  purposes of this
      subchapter, each parcel being more particularly described by a reference
      to the number of such parcel, as given  on  such  map,  and  the  title,
      interest  or  easement sought to be acquired to, in or over such parcel,
      whether a fee or otherwise, shall be stated in the petition.

      addition to the notice required in  section  four  hundred  two  of  the
      eminent  domain  procedure law shall give notice in the City Record, and
      in two public newspapers published in  the  city.  A  statement  of  the
      boundaries  of the real estate to be acquired or affected, with separate
      enumerations of the numbers of the parcels to be taken in  fee,  and  of
      the  numbers  of  the parcels in which any interest or easement is to be
      acquired, with a reference to the date and place of filing  the  map  or
      maps  shall be sufficient description of the real estate sought to be so

      shall  adjourn  such application to a subsequent day, and in that event,
      at the time to which the same may be  adjourned,  the  court,  upon  due
      proof  to  its  satisfaction  of  such publication and posting, and upon

      compensation to be made to the owners and all persons interested in  the
      real  estate laid down on such maps, as proposed to be taken or affected

      to  the  same  judge,  at one time, however, only as many parcels as can
      reasonably be passed upon and an award  made  therefor,  by  the  court,
      within  the  limits  of  one  year  from entry of the order granting the

      map  hereinbefore  referred  to made by the commissioner of which it has
      been determined by the commissioner that the fee shall be acquired,  and
      shall  be entitled to take and hold such interest in the parcels of land
      in which it has been determined that the fee shall not be  acquired,  as
      has  been  shown on such map and described in the petition. The city may
      upon satisfaction of the requirements of the  eminent  domain  procedure
      law,  take  possession  of  the  lands shown on such map, or any part or
      parts thereof.
        b. The buildings  or  improvements  thereon,  however,  shall  not  be
      removed  or disturbed within one year from the date of the completion of
      notice of entry of the order as required by section five hundred two  of
      the eminent domain procedure law unless ten days' notice is given to the
      owner or to the owner's attorney, of the intention to make such removal,
      and  affording  the  owner an opportunity to examine the property with a
      justice of the court and such witnesses as the owner may desire. If  the
      owner  of  the property cannot be found with due diligence, and there is
      no attorney  representing  the  property  or  parcel,  before  removing,
      disturbing  or  destroying  any  of  the  buildings or improvements, the
      representatives of the city  or  the  corporation  counsel  shall  cause
      measurements  to be made of the buildings and photographs to be taken of
      the exterior views thereof, which measurements and photographs shall  be
      at  the  disposition,  thereafter,  of  the  claimant  or the claimant's
      attorney in case such claimant or attorney shall appear and  demand  the
      same before the claim shall have been tried.

Section 5-366 ::    
        
     
        §  5-366  Proceedings before the court. a. It shall be the duty of the
      corporation counsel to furnish copies of the maps provided for  in  this
      subchapter  to the court. The court shall view the real estate laid down
      on such maps, and shall hear the proofs and allegations  of  any  owner,
      lessee  or  other  person  in any way entitled to, or interested in such
      real estate, or any part or parcel thereof, and  also  such  proofs  and
      allegations as may be offered on behalf of the city.
        b.  After the testimony is closed, the court shall without unnecessary
      delay, ascertain and determine the just  compensation  which  should  be
      made by the city to the owners, or to the persons interested in the real
      estate sought to be acquired or affected by such proceedings.
        c.  In  the  ascertainment  of  the  compensation  for any property or
      property rights so acquired, such compensation shall be based  upon  the
      actual  values  of  the property or the interest acquired therein at the
      time of its taking, and there shall not be taken into consideration  any
      prospective  or  speculative value, based upon the possible, probable or
      actual future use of such property, or property rights, if the same  had
      not been acquired by the city for public use.
        d. The court shall determine:
        1. The height to which the waters of any lake, pond, or natural stream
      concerning  which such proceedings were instituted may be raised and the
      point to which  such  waters  may  be  drawn  down  by  the  city,  such
      determination  to  be  made before any award of damages shall be made on
      account of such proposed raising or depression of such waters.
        2. The sum to be paid to the general or special guardian or  committee
      of  an  infant,  idiot  or  person  of unsound mind, and to the attorney
      appointed by the court to attend to the interests of any  unknown  owner
      or  party  in  interest,  or to the attorney or guardian of any party in
      interest whose interests are unknown or the interest of  any  person  or
      persons not in being.
    
    
    
    
    
    
    

Section 5-367
-------------

Section 5-367 ::    
        
     
        §  5-367  Tentative decree. a. The tentative decree of the court shall
      generally contain, in addition to one  or  more  maps  involved  in  the
      proceedings, the following:
        1.  A brief description of the several parcels of real estate taken or
      affected, with a reference to  the  map  as  showing  the  location  and
      boundaries of each parcel.
        2.  A  statement of the sum estimated and determined upon by the court
      as a just compensation to be made by  the  city  to  the  owners  of  or
      persons entitled to or interested in each parcel so taken or affected.
        3.  A  statement  of  the  names  of  respective  owners of or persons
      entitled thereto or interested therein. In all cases  where  the  owners
      and  parties  interested,  or  their respective estates or interests are
      unknown, or not fully known to the court, it shall be sufficient for the
      court to set forth and state, in general terms, the respective  sums  to
      be allowed and paid to the owners thereof and parties interested therein
      generally,  without specifying the names or estates or interests of such
      owners or parties interested or any or either of them. The  court  shall
      also recommend such sums as shall seem to the court proper to be allowed
      to  the  parties  or  attorneys  appearing  before  the court, as costs,
      counsel  fees,  expenses   and   disbursements,   including   reasonable
      compensation for witnesses as provided in sections seven hundred one and
      seven hundred two of the eminent domain procedure law.
        b.  The  court,  in its discretion, may take up any specified claim or
      claims, and finally ascertain and determine the compensation to be  made
      thereon, and make a separate finding with reference thereto, annexing to
      such  finding  a  copy  of so much of the maps as displays the parcel or
      parcels  so  reported  on.  Such  finding,  as  to  the  claims  therein
      specified,  shall  be  the  finding required in this subchapter, and the
      subsequent action with reference thereto shall be had in the same manner
      as though no other claim was embraced in the proceeding, which, however,
      shall continue as to all claims upon which  no  such  determination  and
      finding shall have been made.
        c.  The tentative decree, shall be filed in the office of the clerk of
      the county in which the real estate shall be situated.

      do so within ten days after  receiving  notice  of  the  filing  of  the
      tentative  decree,  any person interested in the proceedings, shall give
      notice that such decree  will  be  presented  for  confirmation  to  the
      supreme  court,  at a time and place to be specified in such notice. The
      notice shall contain a statement of the time and place of the filing  of
      the decree, and shall be published in each of the newspapers referred to
      in  section  5-358  of  this subchapter, once in each week, for at least
      four weeks immediately prior to the  presentation  of  such  decree  for
      confirmation.
        b.  Upon  the hearing of the application for the confirmation thereof,
      such court shall confirm such decree in whole or in part  after  hearing
      any  objections  thereto  and  amending  the  same  if  proof  presented
      justifies such amendments. As to the whole or any portion of the  decree
      confirmed,  the  court  shall make an order, containing a recital of the
      substance of the proceedings in the  matter  of  the  appraisal  with  a
      general  description  of  the  real  estate  appraised,  and  for  which
      compensation shall be made. The court shall  also  direct  to  whom  the
      money  shall be paid, or in which trust company it shall be deposited by
      the comptroller. Such decree when so confirmed, except in the case of an
      appeal, as provided in section 5-369 of this subchapter, shall be  final
      and  conclusive as well upon the city as upon the owners and all persons
      interested in or entitled to such real estate, and also upon  all  other
      persons whomsoever.
    
    
    
    
    
    
    

Section 5-369

Section 5-369 ::    
        
     
        §  5-369  Appeals.  Within  twenty  days  after  the making, entry and
      service of the final decree, either  party  may  appeal  by  notice,  in
      writing,  to the appellate division of the supreme court of the judicial
      department in which the real estate described in the petition and  shown
      on  the  map  is  situated.  Such  appeal  shall be heard, on due notice
      thereof being given, according to the rules and practice of such  court,
      and  pending  such  appeal  the  comptroller shall deposit in such trust
      company as the court  shall  direct,  the  amount  of  the  award,  with
      interest  to  the  date of such deposit and the funds so deposited shall
      remain with the trust company, subject  to  the  further  order  of  the
      court. On the hearing of such appeal the court may direct a new trial by
      the  supreme  court  and  either  party if aggrieved, may take a further
      appeal, which shall be heard and determined by the court of appeals.  If
      the  amount of compensation to be made by the city shall be increased at
      the second trial, the difference shall be paid by the comptroller to the
      parties entitled to the same, or shall be deposited, as  the  court  may
      direct;  and  if the amount shall be diminished, the difference shall be
      refunded to the city by the trust company. The taking of  an  appeal  by
      any   person  or  persons,  however,  shall  not  operate  to  stay  the
      proceedings under this subchapter, providing  such  award  and  interest
      have been deposited.

      respective  owners  and  bodies,  politic  or  corporate,  mentioned  or
      referred to in such decree, in whose favor any  sum  or  sums  of  money
      shall  be  determined, the respective sum or sums so determined in their
      favor respectively, with lawful interest thereon, from the date title to

      of  the  same  within  such  time,  the respective person or persons, or
      bodies, politic or corporate, in  whose  favor  the  same  shall  be  so
      determined,   his,   her   or  their  executors,  administrators,  legal
      representatives or successors, at any time or times,  after  application
      first  made by him, her or them to the comptroller, for payment thereof,
      may sue for and recover the same, with  such  lawful  interest  and  the
      costs  of  suit,  in  any  proper form of action against the city in any
      court having cognizance thereof, and in which it shall be sufficient  to
      declare  generally  for so much money due to the plaintiff or plaintiffs
      therein by virtue of this subchapter, for real estate taken or  affected
      for  the  purposes herein mentioned. The final decree, with proof of the
      right and title of the plaintiff  or  plaintiffs  to  the  sum  or  sums
      demanded  shall  be  conclusive  evidence  in  such  suit or action, and
      entitle plaintiff to judgment therein.

      in favor of any person or persons,  or  party  or  parties,  whatsoever,
      whether  or  not  named  in  such report, shall be paid to any person or
      persons, or party or parties, when the same shall of  right  belong  and
      should  have  been  paid  to  some  other person or persons, or party or
      parties, it shall be lawful for the  person  or  persons,  or  party  or
      parties to whom the same ought to have been paid, to sue for and recover
      the  same, with lawful interest and costs of suits, as so much money had
      and received to his, her or their use, by the person or  persons,  party
      or parties respectively to whom the same shall have been so paid.

        1. To carry into effect any agreed plan for the disposal of the sewage
        Of the village of Brewster,
        Of  one  or  more  villages or sewer districts, in the town of Carmel,
      (and for such purpose, to  construct,  operate  and  maintain  a  sewage
      disposal   plant,   equipment  and  facilities,  or  the  extension  and
      improvement of existing plants, if any, therein),

      Ulster, Delaware, Schoharie and Greene, and the plans for such operating
      systems  and plants for the collection and disposal of sewage shall have

      through  its  commissioner  of environmental protection, notwithstanding
      the provisions of any special  or  general  act  to  the  contrary,  may
      present  a petition to the supreme court in the county involved, stating
      the proposed  location  of  such  operating  system  or  plant  for  the
      collection  and  disposal  of  sewage, that the plans therefor have been
      approved by the state department of health,  that  application  for  the
      location  thereof  in  accordance  with  such plans has been made to the
      municipal authorities or town board having  jurisdiction  thereover  and
      has  been  unreasonably denied, or withheld, and such other facts as the
      petitioner may deem pertinent, together  with  a  prayer  for  an  order

      the presiding justice shall hear the parties to such proceeding and also
      such  other  residents  of  the sewer district of the village or town as
      desire to be heard.
        If the justice presiding be satisfied that the  municipal  authorities
      of  the village or the town board of the town have unreasonably withheld
      the approval of the location of such operating system or sewage disposal
      plant, the justice may, by order, grant the petition. Upon the entry  of
      such  order,  the  city may acquire, by purchase or condemnation, in the
      manner provided by law, such real estate, rights of way and easements to
    
      and into such real estate as may be necessary for the  proper  erection,
      construction  and operation, of such operating system or sewage disposal
      plant, and may construct the same in accordance with the plans  approved
      by the state department of health.
