Section 5-431 ::    
        
     
        §  5-431  Effect  upon  prior street closings. This subchapter, or any
      part thereof, shall not apply to any street heretofore closed.
    
    
    
    
    
    
    

Section 5-432
-------------

Section 5-432 ::    
        
     
        §  5-432 Authority to close streets and to acquire any right, title or
      interest  therein.  a.  The  city   may   authorize   the   closing   or
      discontinuance of the surface, subsurface or air space over such streets
      therein,  in  whole  or  in  part,  upon the determination that (1) such
      closing or discontinuance will further the health, safety, pedestrian or
      vehicular circulation, housing, economic development or general  welfare
      of  the  city and (2) in the case of a partial closing or discontinuance
      of the subsurface or air space over such streets, will not substantially
      interfere  with  pedestrian  or  vehicular  use  of  such  streets.   In
      connection  with  the closing or discontinuance of the subsurface or air
      space  over  such  streets,  the  city  may  authorize  the  closing  or
      discontinuance  of  so  much  of  such streets, in whole or in part, for
      easements and such other rights as may  be  necessary  or  desirable  in
      order  to effect the construction and support of any improvements in the
      closed or discontinued air space over or the subsurface of such streets.
      Any such closing or  discontinuance  shall  be  effected  as  a  capital
      project. In connection with any such closing or discontinuance, the city
      may  acquire  any right, title or interest in the closed or discontinued
      streets or the closed or discontinued portions  thereof,  including  the
      surface or subsurface of or the air space over such streets as a capital
      project,   whenever   it  may  deem  that  such  acquisition  will  more
      effectually secure the actual discontinuance and closing of streets,  in
      whole  or in part, which may be legally discontinued and closed pursuant
      to this subchapter. The provisions of this  subchapter  which  refer  to
      land  or lands within or lying within a closed or discontinued street or
      within a street to be closed or discontinued shall be deemed to refer to
      the surface and subsurface of and air space over such street or any part
      of the surface or subsurface of or  air  space  over  such  street.  The
      provisions  of  this subchapter which refer to fee title shall be deemed
      to refer to any right, title or interest acquired or to be  acquired  by
      the city.
        b.  Compensation and recompense shall be made to the respective owners
      of the real property affected or damaged by reason of any  such  closing
      and  to  the  respective  owners of the fee title to the land within the
      closed street for the damages caused by the taking by the city  of  such
      fee title.
        c.  Notwithstanding  the  provisions  of any general, special or local
      law, the provisions of chapter one of title four and subchapter four  of
      chapter  three  of  this  title  shall  be  applicable  to the following
      sections of the state arterial highway system located within the city of
      New York provided that with regard to  such  sections  all  requirements
      imposed  by  federal  and  state  law  shall be complied with, including
      requirements relating to the construction and support of improvements in
      such sections: Franklin  D.  Roosevelt  drive  from  and  including  the
      Brooklyn  Battery crossing to the easterly prolongation of the northerly
      line of Robert F. Wagner, Senior place.
        d. Where the whole or a part of the subsurface of a  street  has  been
      closed   or  discontinued  pursuant  to  this  section,  public  utility
      facilities in such subsurface or  part  thereof  may  be  maintained  in
      place,  or,  if  the  proposed  use  of  such  subsurface  requires  the
      relocation of utility facilities,  the  owner  of  such  facilities  may
      relocate  such  facilities  elsewhere within or without such subsurface,
      provided, however, that any maintenance in place or relocation  of  such
      facilities shall be authorized by the city pursuant to subdivision one-a
      of  section  5-433 of this subchapter. Nothing in this section, however,
      shall be deemed to create any liability arising from the cost of  public
      utility  facility  relocation  not recognized at common law or otherwise
      created by statute.

      has been authorized as a capital project, the resolution of the board of

      or discontinuance of such street, shall:
        1. Specify and describe by courses and distances the part  or  section
      of  such  street  which  it is proposed to discontinue and close and the
      date upon which such street shall become and be closed, which date shall
      not be prior to the date upon which the map, showing the street or  such
      part  thereof  proposed  to  be  closed,  shall  be filed as provided in
      section 5-435 of this subchapter, nor subsequent  to  the  date  of  the
      entry of the final decree of the court.

      a  street,  in  whole  or  in part, specify if public utility facilities
      within the subsurface of such street shall be  maintained  in  place  or
      relocated  within  or without such subsurface so that the maintenance in
      place or proposed relocation of such facilities is consistent  with  the
      proposed   use  of  the  closed  portion  of  such  subsurface  and  the
      requirements of other facilities located therein.
        2. State whether the effectual closing of such street, or other public
      necessity, requires the acquisition of the fee title to the whole or any
      portion of the land within the street to be closed, and in case it shall
      state that such acquisition is  necessary,  shall  further  request  the
      mayor to provide for such acquisition simultaneously with the closing of
      such street, and shall specify and describe the part of the lands within
      the closed street, fee title to which should be acquired.
        3.  Adopt  three  similar  maps  or  plans,  prepared  by  the  agency
      requesting such closing and acquisition, showing the street discontinued
      and closed, the nature and extent of such discontinuance and closing and
      the location  of  the  immediately  adjacent  or  intersecting  open  or
      established   public   streets   of   the   city,   sufficient  for  the
      identification and location thereof.
        4. Authorize and direct the corporation counsel to make application to
      the supreme court to have  such  court  without  a  jury  ascertain  and
      determine the compensation which justly should be made to the respective
      owners of the real property affected, damaged, extinguished or destroyed
      by such closing.

      the closing or discontinuance of a street requires  the  acquisition  of
      the  fee title to the whole or any portion of the land within the street
      to be closed, the order of the mayor directing such acquisition shall:
        1. Approve three maps, prepared by the agency  requesting  the  street
      closing  and acquisition, showing the land in such closed street the fee
      title to which is to be acquired.
        2. Authorize and direct the corporation counsel to make application to
      the supreme court to have  such  court  without  a  jury  ascertain  and
      determine  the compensation which ought justly be made to the respective
      owners of the fee title to the land within such closed street.
        3. Specify the date upon which the city shall acquire fee title  which
      date  shall be the same as that specified in the resolution of the board
      of  estimate  as  the  date  upon  which  the  street  proposed  to   be
      discontinued or closed, shall become and be closed.

      why further proceedings under this subchapter on the part of such  owner
      or  owners  or  of the corporation counsel should not be expedited. Upon

        §  5-449 Amendment of street closing proceeding to include acquisition
      of fee title to closed street. Where a street has been  closed  pursuant
      to  the  provisions  of this subchapter, and the compensation to be made
      for the damages caused by the closing thereof is to be  ascertained  and
      determined  by the supreme court without a jury, and the city is not the
      owner of the fee title to the land within such  closed  street  and  the
      effectual  closing  of  such  street  or  part  thereof, or other public
      necessity, requires that such city should acquire the fee title  to  the
      whole  or  part  of the land within the closed street, the city shall be
      authorized to acquire the fee title thereto for the purposes provided by
      this subchapter. Such acquisition may be authorized before or after  the
      institution  of  a  proceeding  to have the supreme court without a jury
      ascertain and determine the compensation to  be  made  for  the  damages
      caused  by  the  closing  of  such  street,  but  the order of the mayor
      instituting the proceeding for the acquisition shall be  approved  prior
      to  the filing of the tentative decree in any street closing proceeding.
      The mayor, in issuing such order, shall comply with  the  provisions  of
      section  5-434 of this subchapter. Such order shall authorize and direct
      the corporation counsel to apply to the  supreme  court  in  the  proper
      judicial  district  to  have  such  court  without  a jury ascertain and
      determine the compensation which justly should be made to the respective
      owners of the fee title to the land within the  closed  street  for  the
      damages  sustained  by  such owners on account of the acquisition by the
      city of the fee title thereto. Such order shall specify  the  date  upon
      which  the  fee  title to the land within the closed street shall become
      and be vested  in  the  city,  in  accordance  with  the  provisions  of
      subdivision three of section 5-434, which date shall not be prior to the
      entry  of the order authorizing the court to ascertain and determine the
      compensation to be made therefor nor subsequent  to  the  entry  of  the
      final  decree  of  the court in such proceeding. Upon the date so fixed,
      the fee title to the land within the closed street shall become  and  be
      vested  in  the  city.  Upon  the issuance of such order the corporation
      counsel shall give notice by publication for ten days in the City Record
      that he or she will apply to the supreme court,  stating  the  time  and
      place  when  and where such application will be made, to have such court
      without a jury ascertain and determine  the  compensation  which  justly
      should  be  made  to  the respective owners of the fee title to the land
      within the closed street. Upon such application the corporation  counsel
      shall present to the court a petition signed and verified by him or her,
      setting  forth  the  action  had  by  the mayor, and indicating the land
      within the closed street, the fee title to which is to  be  acquired  by
      the  city,  by  a precise description with courses and distances, having
      reference to the city map, an extract from which shall be attached,  and
      praying  that  the compensation to be made therefor shall be ascertained
      and determined by such court without a  jury.  At  the  time  and  place
      specified   in   such  notice,  unless  the  court  shall  adjourn  such
      application to a subsequent day, and, in that event,  at  the  time  and
      place  to  which  the  same  may  be  adjourned,  upon  due proof to its
      satisfaction of the publication of such notice and upon  the  filing  of
      such  petition, the court shall enter an order granting the application,
      which order shall be filed in the office of the clerk of the  county  in
      which  the  closed  street  is  situated. Awards for damages, due to the
      acquisition of the fee title to the land within the closed street, shall
      be made as provided  in  any  proceeding  instituted  pursuant  to  this
      subchapter.

      board of estimate, with respect to a street closing, and the mayor, with
      respect to acquisition, either before of  after  the  institution  of  a
      proceeding  under  this subchapter, to agree with the owners of the real
      property that will be affected  by  such  closing,  for  and  about  the
      cession  to  the  city  of  other  real  property  included  within  the
      boundaries of any established street shown on the city map, in  lieu  of
      the real property comprised within the lines of the closed street, or to
      agree  for  and about the compensation to be made to such owners for the
      same or for and about the value of real property to be ceded in lieu  of
      such discontinued or closed portion or portions of such street.
        b.  In  case of any such agreement or agreements with part only of the
      owners entitled to and interested in the same real property so affected,
      for the purpose of making any such discontinuance or closing, or cession
      in lieu of such closing, the same shall be valid and  binding  upon  the
      parties thereto, and the court shall nevertheless enter upon and make or
      proceed  with  its  estimate,  and tentative and final decrees as to the
      residue of such real property affected by the closing, concerning  which
      the owners thereof shall not agree.
        c.  The final decree of the court shall be of like force and effect in
      regard to the matters comprised therein, as if no such agreement  as  to
      the part of the premises had been made.

      surveys, diagrams, maps or plans which shall be attached to such tabular
      abstracts.
        b. The court shall appraise and determine and separately set forth and
      state  in  the  tabular  abstract,  the  value  of  the right, title and
      interest of the city in and to the fee of the  land  within  the  closed
      street.
        c.  Such  tabular  abstracts shall be signed by the justice trying the
      proceedings and filed with the clerk of each county in which the  closed
      street  and the real property abutting thereon or any part of either may
      be situated and when so filed shall constitute the tentative  decree  of
      the  court  as  to  awards for damages and as to the value of the city's
      interest in the respective parcels of land within the closed street.

        3.  That the amounts set opposite the respective damage parcel numbers
      in the column headed "final awards for closing damages" in  the  tabular
      abstract  of  awards  constitute and are the just compensation which the
      respective owners are entitled to receive  from  the  city  for  damages

        2.  The  names of the respective owners of the several parcels damaged
      by the closing of such street, as  far  as  the  same  shall  have  been
      ascertained,  provided that in all cases where the owners are unknown or
      not fully known to the court, it shall be sufficient to  set  forth  and
      state  in  general terms in the decree the respective sums to be allowed
      and paid to or by the owners of  the  respective  parcels  for  loss  or

      city, or any party or person affected by the proceeding and aggrieved by
      the final decree of the court  therein,  may  appeal  to  the  appellate
      division of the court. An appeal from the final decree of the court must
      be  taken  within  thirty  days after notice of the filing of such final
      decree. Such appeal shall be taken and heard in the manner  provided  by
      the civil practice law and rules and the rules and practice of the court
      in  relation  to  appeals  in  special proceedings. Such appeal shall be
      heard and determined by the appellate division upon the merits, both  as
      to  the  questions  of  law and fact. The determination of the appellate
      division shall be in the form of an order. The taking of  an  appeal  by
      any  person  or  persons shall not operate to stay the proceedings under
      this subchapter, except as to the particular  parcel  of  real  property
      with  which the appeal is concerned. The final decree of the court shall
      be deemed to be final  and  conclusive  upon  all  parties  and  persons
      affected thereby, who have not appealed. Such appeal shall be heard upon
      the evidence taken before the court, or such part or portion thereof, as
      the  justice  at  special  term,  who made the decree appealed from, may
      certify, or the parties to such appeal may agree upon as  sufficient  to
      present  the  merits  of  the  questions in respect to which such appeal
      shall be had.
        b. The city, or any party or person affected  by  the  proceeding  and
      aggrieved  by  the  order  of the appellate division entered on any such
      appeal, may appeal to the court of appeals from such order. Such  appeal
      shall  be  taken  and heard in the manner provided by the civil practice
      law and rules and the rules and practice of  the  court  of  appeals  in
      relation  to  appeals  from  orders in special proceedings. The court of
      appeals may affirm or reverse the order appealed from and may make  such
      order or direction as shall be appropriate to the case.

      charges of any agency of the city, or others, which shall be required by
      law to be taxed, shall not be paid or allowed for any service  performed
      under  this  subchapter,  unless the same shall be taxed by the court. A
      bill of such costs, charges and expenses shall be filed in the office of
      the clerk of the court in the county in which the land  is  situated  at
      least  ten  days  before  the  same shall be presented for taxation, and
      there shall be annexed thereto a  statement  of  the  amounts,  if  any,
      previously  taxed,  to  whom  the same were payable and the date of such
      taxation. A notice shall be published in the City Record, for ten  days,
      of  the time and place of taxing such costs, charges and expenses, which
      shall be thereupon taxed by a justice of the  supreme  court,  or  by  a
      referee under his or her special order.
        b.  All  such  costs  and expenses or disbursements shall be stated in
      detail in the  bill  of  costs,  charges  and  expenses,  and  shall  be
      accompanied by such proof of the reasonableness and necessity thereof as
      is  now  required  by law and the practice of the court upon taxation of
      costs and disbursements in other special proceedings or actions in  such
      court.

      awarded by the court, and all costs and expenses which may be  taxed  in
      the  proceeding,  shall  be  paid  by the city to the respective persons
      mentioned or referred to in the final decree of the court  or  in  whose
      favor  such  costs  and  expenses  shall  be taxed. In a capital project
      proceeding, such costs and expenses shall be deemed part of the cost  of
      the  acquisition of land or permanent rights in land and may be financed
      in the same manner as the acquisition of land  or  permanent  rights  in
      land.
        b.  Whenever  the  amount  of  damages  awarded  in  any final decree,
      together with the costs which shall have been taxed in  the  proceeding,
      shall  exceed the balance remaining in the fund, from which such amounts
      are  payable,  after  deducting  all  outstanding  claims  against  such
      balance,  the court, upon proper application of an owner or other person
      entitled to such excess, shall require the city to issue and sell serial
      bonds the proceeds of which shall be paid into such fund  to  meet  such
      deficiency.
        c. In default of payment, in a capital project proceeding, the owners,
      or  other persons entitled to be paid, may at any time after application
      first made to the comptroller therefor, sue for and recover  the  amount
      due, with lawful interest and the costs of suit.
        d.  Except  when any sum or sums of money shall in the final decree be
      made to "unknown owners", the supreme court, upon the application of the
      city or of any person entitled to or claiming to be  interested  in  the
      lands,  tenements or hereditaments for which such awards have been made,
      or any part thereof, shall either direct the same to be retained by  the
      comptroller,  or  to  be  paid  into  the  supreme court until the title
      thereto or the respective interests and estates of all  parties  therein
      shall  be  determined  by the court. Upon such application the court may
      take the proofs and testimony of the claimant or  claimants  or  parties
      interested in the lands for which the awards have been made or refer the
      matter to a referee for such purpose.

      thereto. a. Whenever the owner, in whose favor any awards shall be made,
      shall be a minor or incompetent or absent from the city, and also in all
      cases where the name of the owner shall not be set forth or mentioned in
      the final decree, or where such owner, being named  therein,  cannot  be
      found,  or  where  there  are adverse or conflicting claims to the money
      awarded as compensation, it shall be lawful for the comptroller  to  pay
      such  awards  made  in  the  final  decree into the supreme court, to be
      invested, secured, disposed of and paid out as such court shall  direct.
      Such  payment shall be as valid and effectual in all respects as if made
      to such owners according to their just rights, if they  had  been  known
      and had all been present, of full age and competent.
        b. In all cases, however, where any such award, which shall be made in
      the  final  decree  in favor of any person whether named or not named in
      the final decree of the court, shall be paid to any  person  or  persons
      whomsoever,  when the same shall of right belong, and ought to have been
      paid to some other person or persons, it shall be lawful for the  person
      or  persons,  to  whom  the same ought to have been paid, to sue for and
      recover the same, with lawful interest  and  costs  of  suit,  from  the
      person  or  persons,  to  whom the same shall have been paid, as so much
      money had and received to the use of the plaintiff or plaintiffs, by the
      person or persons, respectively, to whom the same  shall  have  been  so
      paid, and the final decree of the court, with proof of payment, shall be
      conclusive evidence of such payment in such suit.
