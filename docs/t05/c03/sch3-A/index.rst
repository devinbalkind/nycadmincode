Section 5-376 ::    
        
     
        §  5-376  Determination of additional sources of water supply; reports
      to board of estimate. a. It shall be the duty  of  the  commissioner  of
      environmental  protection to proceed immediately and with all reasonable
      speed, to ascertain what sources exist and are most available, desirable
      and best for an additional supply of pure and wholesome  water  for  the
      city. The commissioner shall make such studies, investigations, surveys,
      maps,  plans,  profiles,  estimates  and reports as the commissioner may
      deem proper in order to ascertain the facts as to such sources and shall
      report to the board of estimate with recommendations as to  what  action
      should in the commissioner's opinion be taken with reference thereto. It
      shall be lawful for the board of estimate and the commissioner to report
      upon,  consider and determine the project in parts or sections from time
      to time as they may deem fit, so that the city may be able to obtain  an
      additional  supply  of  water  from one or more sources before the whole
      additional supply contemplated may be obtained.
        b. If at any time the board of  estimate  shall  determine  it  to  be
      advisable that the needs of the city with respect to its water supply or
      with  regard  to  the  delivery  of such supply to points convenient for
      distribution among the several boroughs shall be  made  the  subject  of
      study  and  investigation,  the commissioner of environmental protection
      shall forthwith  proceed  with  such  studies  and  investigations  and,
      together  with  his  or  her  recommendations,  report  to  the board of
      estimate. Upon receipt of any such report  the  board  of  estimate  may
      consider  and act upon it in the same manner and with the same authority
      as provided in this section and in any following sections.

Section 5-377 ::    
        
     
        § 5-377 Further reports to board of estimate; hearings; map or plan of
      whole  work  to be approved and filed. a. The board of estimate upon the
      receipt of such report or reports of the commissioner may adopt,  modify
      or reject the whole or any part of the same, and may cause such studies,
      investigations, surveys, maps, plans, profiles, estimates and reports to
      be made, and such further information to be obtained as the commissioner
      shall  deem  expedient  to enable him or her to act intelligently in the
      premises.  In  case  of   the   modification   or   rejection   of   the
      recommendations  in  such  report  or reports or any part thereof by the
      board of estimate, the commissioner in like manner  as  aforesaid  shall
      prepare   and   submit   to  the  board  of  estimate  further  studies,
      investigations, surveys, maps, plans, profiles,  estimates  and  reports
      and  make  such  changes  and  modifications as shall seem proper to the
      board of estimate, and shall continue so to do under  the  direction  of
      the  board  of  estimate, until a map, plan or plans covering the entire
      work contemplated by this subchapter shall be approved  and  adopted  by
      such  board.  The map, plan or plans may be made and adopted in parts or
      sections from time to time, and may be changed or modified either before
      or after adoption as the board of estimate may deem  necessary  for  the
      more efficient carrying out of the provisions of this subchapter.
        b.  The  board  of estimate prior to the adoption of such map, plan or
      plans, or  to  a  modification  thereof  shall  afford  to  all  persons
      interested a reasonable opportunity to be heard respecting the same, and
      shall  give reasonable public notice of such hearing, at which testimony
      may be produced by the parties appearing in such manner as the board  of
      estimate  may  determine,  and  each  member  of  the  board  is  hereby
      authorized to administer oaths and issue  subpoenas  in  any  proceeding
      pending  before them under this subchapter. Notice of such hearing shall
      be given, in  addition  to  the  above  provision,  by  mailing  to  the
      chairperson  and  clerk  of the board of supervisors of the county where
      the real estate to be acquired is situated a notice of such  hearing  at
      least eight days before the time named in the notice.
        c.  A  final  map,  plan or plans approved and adopted by the board of
      estimate shall be executed in quadruplicate, one of which  shall  remain
      on  file with the clerk of the board of estimate, one shall be placed on
      file in the office of the commissioner of environmental protection, one,
      or a certified copy thereof, shall be filed in the county clerk's office
      or register's office of each county in which any of  the  land  affected
      thereby is situated.
        d.  Provided,  however,  that  no reservoir or other structure for the
      storage or impounding of water,  shall  be  constructed,  at  any  time,
      within  the  drainage  area of the Esopus creek in the county of Ulster,
      other than that designated in the reports of William  H.  Burr,  Rudolph
      Hering  and John R. Freeman to the Honorable George B. McClellan, mayor,
      chairman, board of estimate of the city of New York, as to  the  Ashokan
      reservoir, the flow line of which shall not exceed elevation six hundred
      feet coast and geodetic survey datum.

Section 5-378 ::    
        
     
        §  5-378 Entry to prepare maps and to post notice. The commissioner of
      environmental  protection,   the   commissioner's   agents,   engineers,
      surveyors  and  such  other  persons  as  may be necessary to enable the
      commissioner to perform his or her  duties  under  this  subchapter  are
      hereby  authorized  to enter upon any land, or water, for the purpose of
      making surveys, examinations or investigations and preparing  the  maps,
      plans and reports contemplated by this subchapter and for the purpose of
      posting any notices that may be required to be published in like manner.
    
    
    
    
    
    
    

Section 5-379
-------------

Section 5-379 ::    
        
     
        §  5-379  Real  estate  maps;  preparation,  submission  and  adoption
      thereof.  After the approval, adoption and filing of a final  map,  plan
      or plans described in section 5-377 of this subchapter, the commissioner
      shall  prepare  and  submit to the board of estimate six similar maps of
      the real estate to be acquired or affected for the purpose  of  carrying
      out  the  said plan or plans, or any part thereof. Upon those maps there
      shall be laid out and separately numbered the various  parcels  of  real
      estate acquisition of which is made necessary for the prosecution of the
      work  authorized  by  this subchapter, including the lands adjoining the
      Esopus creek between the point on such creek, in the town of  Shandaken,
      Ulster  county,  where the Schoharie tunnel empties into such creek, and
      the Ashokan reservoir of the city, in such county, the owners  of  which
      lands  shall  be entitled to recover the decrease in value of such lands
      by reason of  any  acts  of  the  city  under  the  provisions  of  this
      subchapter  or  any  previous  act,  such  damages to be determined by a
      commission in the same manner as damages for the taking of real property
      are determined. On such maps, the property division  lines  existing  at
      the  time  of the survey shall be delineated, and there shall be plainly
      indicated those parcels of which the fee,  and  over  or  through  which
      parcels  the  right  to  use  and  occupy  the  same  temporarily  or in
      perpetuity, is to be acquired. The board of estimate may  adopt,  modify
      or  reject  such  maps in whole or in part and require others to be made
      instead  thereof.  In  case  of  such  rejection,  the  commissioner  of
      environmental protection shall in like manner, as aforesaid, prepare and
      submit  others,  until  maps  shall be approved by the board of estimate
      covering the entire area required for the purpose of  carrying  out  the
      said plan or plans, or any part thereof. Such maps may be made and filed
      in  sections.  One or more sections may be determined before the maps of
      the whole construction are completed. Such sections shall be  determined
      and  decided  upon  previous  to  the  appointment of the commissions as
      hereinafter provided for, and shall be so determined that one commission
      shall not be appointed for a section covering  more  property  than  can
      reasonably  be passed upon and awards made by such commission within the
      limits of a  year  from  the  time  of  the  filing  of  the  oaths,  as
      hereinafter  provided.  The  proceedings  hereinafter authorized may, in
      like manner, be taken separately in reference to one  or  more  of  such
      sections  before  the  maps of the whole are filed. The work upon one or
      more of such sections may be begun before  the  maps  of  the  remaining
      sections are filed. The maps when adopted by the board of estimate shall
      be  transmitted  by  such  board  to  the  corporation  counsel,  with a
      certificate of such adoption written thereon and signed by a majority of
      the board.

      which any real estate laid out on such map shall be located except  that
      in  any  county in which there is a register's office, such map shall be
      filed therein instead of in the office of the county  clerk.  The  other
      maps  described in section 5-379 of this subchapter shall be disposed of
      in the manner indicated in succeeding sections of this subchapter.

      parcel being more particularly described by a reference to the number of
      such  parcel  as given on such maps, and the title, interest or easement
      sought to be acquired to, in or over  such  parcel,  whether  a  fee  or
      otherwise, shall be stated in the petition.

      and in two public newspapers published in the city of New  York  and  in
      two  public  newspapers published in each other county in which any real
      estate laid out on such maps may be located, and which it is proposed to

      courses and distances and  of  the  greatest  and  least  width  of  its
      required  easement  or  parcel of land with a reference to the dates and
      places of filing such maps, shall be sufficient description of the  real
      estate  sought  to  be  so  taken  or  affected. Such notice shall be so
      published, once in each week, in each of such newspapers, for six  weeks
      immediately  previous  to  the  presentation  of  such petition; and the
      corporation counsel shall in addition to such advertisement cause copies
      of the same in hand bills to be posted up, for the same space of time in
      at least twenty conspicuous places on the line of the aqueduct or in the
      vicinity of the real estate so to be taken or affected and shall cause a

      provisions of this subchapter, the corporation counsel may  apply  at  a
      special  term  of  the supreme court in the same judicial district where

      a  successor  commission,  upon  first  giving  ten  days'   notice   by
      advertisement  in  the  newspapers  hereinabove  described of his or her

Section 5-386 ::    
        
     
        §  5-386  Vesting  of  title;  possession;  removal  of  buildings  or
      improvements. On filing such oaths, in the manner  provided  in  section
      5-384  of this subchapter, the city shall be and become seized in fee of
      all those parcels of real estate which are on the maps  referred  to  in
      section  5-379 of this subchapter delineated as parcels, of which it has
      been determined that the fee should be acquired, and shall also  be  and
      become  vested  of  the  easements,  in, over, upon or through all those
      other parcels of real estate  which  are  on  said  maps  delineated  as
      parcels  in,  over,  upon  or  through which it has been determined that
      easements should be acquired; and may immediately  or  at  any  time  or
      times  thereafter  take  possession  of  the  same  or any part or parts
      thereof without  any  suit  or  proceeding  at  law  for  that  purpose;
      provided,  however, that before the city takes possession of the same it
      shall pay to the respective owner or owners of each of such  parcels  of
      real  estate, which are upon such maps delineated as parcels of which it
      has been determined that the fee should  be  acquired,  (a)  if  located
      outside   the  counties  of  Ulster,  Greene,  Sullivan,  Schoharie  and
      Delaware, a sum of money equal to one-half  the  assessed  valuation  of
      such  real  property as the same appears upon the assessment roll of the
      town or tax district in which the same is  situate  for  the  year  next
      preceding  that  in which the city becomes seized in fee of each of such
      parcels of real estate, and (b) if located in the  counties  of  Ulster,
      Greene,  Sullivan,  Schoharie or Delaware, a sum of money equal to fifty
      per centum of the full valuation of such real estate. In the event  that
      a  parcel  so  delineated  on said map as a fee parcel is not separately
      assessed on the assessment roll of the town or tax district in which the
      same is situated but is assessed as a part of another  tract,  then  the
      amount  which  the  city  shall be required to pay or deposit under this
      section shall be (a) if the parcel be located outside  the  counties  of
      Ulster,  Greene,  Sullivan, Schoharie and Delaware, the proportion which
      the assessed valuation of the parcel  acquired  bears  to  the  assessed
      valuation  of  the  entire  property  as  a part of which said parcel is
      assessed, and (b) if the parcel be located in the  counties  of  Ulster,
      Greene,  Sullivan,  Schoharie or Delaware, the proportion which the full
      valuation of the parcel acquired bears to  the  full  valuation  of  the
      entire  property as a part of which said parcel is assessed. The supreme
      court in the judicial district in which the land is situated  is  hereby
      authorized  to  make  an order prorating such assessed valuation or full
      valuation, as the case may be, and to determine the proportion  of  such
      assessed valuation or full valuation, as the case may be, which the city
      of  New  York  shall be required to pay before taking possession of such
      parcel. The city, at its option and by agreement  with  such  respective
      owner or owners, may, instead of paying to him or her or them the amount
      or  amounts  hereinbefore  required,  pay to him or her or them a sum or
      sums of money greater than but not more than twice the amount or amounts
      hereinbefore required. For the purposes  of  this  section  only,  "full
      valuation"  of real estate shall mean the assessed valuation thereof, as
      the same appears on the assessment roll of the town or tax  district  in
      which  the  real  estate  is situate for the year next preceding that in
      which the city becomes seized in fee thereof, divided  by  the  rate  of
      assessment  of  real  property in such town or tax district for the same
      year as finally recommended for adoption by  the  state  tax  commission
      under  the provisions of the real property tax law formerly contained in
      sections fifty and one hundred seventy-four of the tax law.  Deposit  of
      all  moneys  hereunder  to the credit of, or payable to the order of the
      owner, pursuant to the direction of the court, shall be deemed a payment
      within the provisions of this section, and, thereupon, the  commissioner
      of environmental protection, or any person or persons acting under their
    
      or  its  authority may enter upon and use and occupy to the exclusion of
      any and all other persons all the parcels of real estate  delineated  on
      such  map for the purpose of carrying out the plan or plans, or any part
      thereof,  described  in  section  5-377  of  this  subchapter, provided,
      however, that no buildings or improvements shall be removed or disturbed
      within one year from the  date  of  the  filing  of  the  oaths  of  the
      commissioners  unless  thirty  days'  notice  in writing is given to the
      owner, or to his or her attorney, if any, by the corporation counsel  of
      the  intention  to  make  such  removal,  and  affording  the  owner  an
      opportunity to examine the property with the commissioners of  appraisal
      and such witnesses as he or she may desire. If the owner of the property
      can  not  be  found  with  due  diligence,  and  there  is  no  attorney
      representing such property or parcel, before  removing,  disturbing,  or
      destroying  any  of the buildings, or the improvements, a representative
      of the commissioner of environmental protection or  of  the  corporation
      counsel  shall  cause  measurements  to  be  made  of  the buildings and
      photographs of  the  exterior  views  thereof,  which  measurements  and
      photographs  shall be at the disposition thereafter of the claimants, or
      their attorneys, in case such claimants or their attorneys should appear
      and demand the same before the case is tried.

      they  or  any one of them, in the absence of the others, may adjourn the
      proceedings from time to  time  in  their  discretion;  but  they  shall

      authority  to prepare a calendar of all such claims and to determine the
      order and priority of the hearing  of  such  claims;  to  set  down  the
      hearing  of any such claim for a day certain; and to order an inquest in
      or a dismissal of any claim for failure of a party to appear at the time
      designated for  the  hearing  thereof  unless  the  commissioners  shall
      determine  that  a reasonable excuse for such failure exists. They shall
      view the real estate laid down on the maps and shall hear the proofs and
      allegations of any owner, lessee, or other person in any way entitled to
      or interested in such real estate or any part  or  parcel  thereof,  and
      also  such  proofs  and  allegations  as may be offered on behalf of the
      city. They shall rule upon motions and  objections  made  in  connection
      with  the admission or exculsion of testimony or evidence in any hearing
      before the commissioners and shall make findings upon which their awards
      are made and separate findings upon which the fees  and  allowances  are
      based. They shall reduce the testimony taken before them to writing, and
      after  the  testimony  is closed, they or a majority of them, all having
      considered the same, and having an  opportunity  to  be  present,  shall
      without   unnecessary  delay,  ascertain  and  determine  the  just  and
      equitable compensation which ought justly to be made by the city to  the
      owners  or  the  persons  interested  in  the  real  estate sought to be
      acquired or affected by such proceedings, including just  and  equitable
      compensation  to  the  owner  of  any leasehold taken or affected in the
      proceeding. Such commissioners of appraisal shall make reports of  their
      proceedings  to  the supreme court as in the next section provided, with
      the minutes of the testimony taken by them and the findings of fact made
      by them, and they shall be entitled to the payments hereinafter provided
      for their services and expenses to be paid  from  the  fund  hereinafter
      provided.
        b.  In  case of the death, resignation, refusal or neglect to serve of
      any or all of such commissioners of appraisal, the  corporation  counsel
      shall  upon  ten  days'  notice  to  be  given  by  advertisement in the
      newspapers designated as hereinbefore provided,  apply  to  the  supreme
      court  at a special term thereof, to be held in the judicial district in
      which the land or any part  thereof  affected  by  the  proceedings,  is
      situated,  for  the appointment of one or more commissioners to fill the
      vacancy or vacancies so occasioned.
        c. In the event that the corporation counsel shall  fail,  neglect  or
      refuse  to  make  such  application  within  thirty  days after any such
      vacancy  shall  have  occurred  as  hereinabove  provided,  any   person
      interested   in   the   proceeding   may   similarly  apply  after  such
      advertisement for the filling of any vacancy. The city of New York shall
      be liable for the reasonable expenses  of  such  advertisement  together
      with ten dollars costs of motion in the event of any such application by
      any such interested person.

Section 5-388 ::    
        
     
        §  5-388 Report of commissioners; compensation for loss to railroad or
      electric  corporation  or  owner  of  water  power;  expenses.  a.   The
      commissioners  of  appraisal  shall  prepare  a  report, and such copies
      thereof as may be required. Such report or reports shall contain a brief
      description of the several parcels of real estate so acquired, taken  or
      affected,  with  a  reference  to  the  map or maps as showing the exact
      location and boundaries of each parcel; a statement of the sum estimated
      and determined upon by them as a just and equitable compensation  to  be
      made  by  the city to the owners or persons entitled to or interested in
      each parcel so taken,  or  as  to  which  any  right,  title,  interest,
      privilege  or  easement  is  taken,  acquired  or  extinguished;  and  a
      statement of the respective  owners  or  persons  entitled  thereto,  or
      interested   therein.  In  every  case  where  the  owners  and  parties
      interested, or their respective estates or interests are unknown, or not
      fully known to the commissioners of appraisal, it  shall  be  sufficient
      for  them to set forth and state in general terms the respective sums to
      be allowed and paid to the owners of,  and  parties  interested  therein
      generally,  without  specifying the name of estates or interests of such
      owners, or parties interested, or any or either of them.
        b. Where  loss,  damage  or  expense,  direct  or  consequential,  has
      resulted  to  any  duly  incorporated  railroad corporation, operating a
      steam railroad in  any  county  in  which  land  shall  be  acquired  in
      pursuance  of  the provisions of this subchapter, or by reason of any of
      the matters in this subchapter involved, or any electric corporation, or
      the owner of any water power on any of the streams or waters affected by
      the provisions of this subchapter,  the  board  of  estimate  is  hereby
      authorized and empowered to agree with such railroad corporation, or any
      such  electric  corporation,  or the owner of any such water power, upon
      the compensation which shall be made to it  for  such  loss,  damage  or
      expense.  In  the event of no agreement being reached between such board
      and such railroad corporation, or any such electric corporation, or  the
      owner  of any such water power, the commissioners of appraisal appointed
      to estimate damages  for  lands  acquired  in  such  county  are  hereby
      authorized  and  directed  to  pass  upon  such claim and to make awards
      therefor as provided in this subchapter.
        c. Subject to  review  by  the  court  as  hereinafter  provided,  the
      commissioners  may  also  recommend  such sums, if any, as shall seem to
      them proper to be allowed, to parties appearing in  the  proceeding,  as
      expenses   and   disbursements  including  reasonable  compensation  for
      witnesses and what sums, if any, ought to be  paid  to  the  general  or
      special  guardian  of an infant, idiot, or person of unsound mind, or to
      an attorney appointed by the court to attend to  the  interests  of  any
      known owner or party in interest who has not appeared in the proceedings
      for expenses or counsel fees.

      one  year after the date of the filing of the oaths of the commissioners
      in the office of a clerk of a county in which real estate sought  to  be
      acquired  may  be  situated  and in case a part of the real estate is in
      another county a duplicate report or certified copy shall  be  filed  in
      the  office  of  the clerk of such other county, provided, however, that
      the supreme court upon application and good reasons shown  therefor  may
      extend  the  time for the taking of testimony or for the preparation and
      filing of such report, or  both,  beyond  one  year  for  a  period  not
      exceeding  eight months. The commissioners of appraisal shall notify the

      receiving  notice  of  such  filing,  any  person  interested   in   the
      proceeding,  shall  give  notice  that such report will be presented for
      confirmation,  modification  (specifying   the   particulars   of   such
      modification  in  respect  to  the  amount of the award, witness fees or

      district  in  which the land or a part thereof is situated at a time and
      place to be specified in such notice, and the objections, if any, to the
      confirmation, modification or rejection  of  such  report  or  any  part
      thereof, shall be heard at such special term. The notice shall contain a
      statement  of  the time and place of the filing of the report and of the
      copy or copies thereof, and shall be published once in each week in each
      of the newspapers referred to previously  in  this  subchapter,  for  at
      least  three  weeks immediately prior to the presentation of such report
      to the supreme court. As used in this section, section 5-391 and section
      5-399 of this subchapter, the terms "modify" and "modification" shall be
      construed to include an increase, a decrease or any other change  in  an

      modification or rejection of the report shall be  made  to  the  supreme
      court  at  a special term thereof held in the judicial district in which
      the land or some part thereof is  situated.  Upon  the  hearing  of  the
      application  such  court may confirm or modify such report or may in its
      discretion order that the report or any portion thereof affecting one or
      more parcels be referred to the same commission, or a new commission for
      a new hearing, and make an order containing a recital of  the  substance
      of  the  proceedings  in  the  matter  of  the  appraisal with a general
      description of the real estate appraised and for which  compensation  is
      to  be made; and shall also direct to whom the money is to be paid or in
      what bank or trust company and in what manner it shall be  deposited  by
      the  comptroller.  Such  order  confirming or modifying the report shall
      (except in case of an appeal, as provided in this subchapter)  be  final
      and  conclusive  as  well  upon  the city as upon owners and all persons
      interested in or entitled to such real estate; and also upon  all  other
      persons whomsoever.

      months after the confirmation of the  report  of  the  commissioners  of
      appraisal, pay to the respective owners and bodies politic or corporate,
      mentioned or referred to in such report, in whose favor, any sum or sums
      of  money  shall  be  estimated  and reported by such commissioners, the
      respective sum  or  sums  so  estimated  and  reported  in  their  favor
      respectively,  with lawful interest thereon, from the date of filing the
      oath and certified  copies  thereof  as  by  this  subchapter  required,
      deducting  therefrom  all  sums  of  money  paid  on  account thereof as
      provided in section 5-386 of this subchapter.  In  case  of  neglect  or
      default  in  the  payment  of  the  same  within the time aforesaid, the
      respective person or persons or bodies politic  or  corporate  in  whose
      favor  the  same  shall  be  so  reported, his, her, or their executors,
      administrators or successors, at any time or  times,  after  application
      first made by him, her, or them, to the comptroller for payment thereof,
      may sue for and recover the same, with lawful interest as aforesaid, and
      the  costs  of suit in any proper form of action against the city in any
      court having cognizance thereof, and it shall be sufficient  to  declare
      generally  for  so much money due to the plaintiff or plaintiffs therein
      by virtue of this subchapter for real estate taken or affected  for  the
      purpose  herein  mentioned,  and  the report of such commissioners, with
      proof of the right and title of the plaintiff or plaintiffs to  the  sum
      or sums demanded shall be conclusive evidence in such suit or action.

      name and nature under this subchapter, except claims provided for  under
      section  5-398,  must be exhibited and presented to the commissioners of
      appraisal having jurisdiction of the same within the  following  periods
      of time:

      acquisition  of  which  is claimed to be the direct or indirect cause of
      damage, or within three years from the execution of the  plan  or  work,
      the  execution of which is claimed to be the direct or indirect cause of

      acquired,  every person neglecting or refusing to present a claim within
      such time shall be deemed to have surrendered his  or  her  interest  in
      such real estate or his or her claims for damages thereto, except so far
      as  such  person may be entitled as an owner of, or person interested in
      the award, if any, made by the commissioners  of  appraisal.  All  other
      claims not exhibited and presented within the time above specified shall
      be forever barred.

Section 5-394 ::    
        
     
        §  5-394  Calendar  call after eighteen months; cessation of interest.
      Not less than eighteen months after the date of the filing of the  oaths
      of  any original commission appointed pursuant to the provisions of this
      subchapter, the corporation counsel may call a session of the commission
      appointed and acting as successor to such original  commission  for  the
      purpose  of  having  such successor commission fix dates for the hearing
      and presentation of any and all claims not theretofore disposed  of  and
      heard; such session shall be known as the calendar call.
        At  least ten days prior to such calendar call the corporation counsel
      shall give personal notice in writing to any or all  persons  interested
      in the proceeding and their attorneys, if any, that such a calendar call
      will  be  held  and  that  dates  will  be  fixed  for  the  hearing and
      presentation of claims. All persons  so  notified  may  appear  at  such
      calendar  call for the purpose of having dates fixed for the hearing and
      presentation of their claims. In the event that persons so notified fail
      to appear at such calendar call, the commission at the  request  of  the
      corporation  counsel shall fix dates for the hearing and presentation of
      their claims, which dates shall be not less than twenty days after  such
      calendar call. The corporation counsel shall further notify such persons
      in  writing of the dates thus fixed, which notice shall be so served not
      less than five days before the date so fixed.  All  persons  failing  to
      appear  on  the  dates fixed by the commission at such calendar call, or
      failing to give legal excuse for so failing to appear to the  commission
      at  or  before the time of such calendar call, shall forfeit their right
      to interest from and after the date  fixed  by  the  commission  at  the
      calendar call on any award made to them.

Section 5-395 ::    
        
     
        §  5-395  Payment  by city as termination of liability. Payment of the
      compensation awarded by the commissioners of appraisal  to  the  persons
      named in their report (if not infants or persons of unsound mind) shall,
      in  the  absence of notice to the city of other claimants to such award,

Section 5-396 ::    
        
     
        §  5-396  Payment to trust company to the credit of the owner; suit to
      determine the rightful owner. Whenever the owner or  owners,  person  or
      persons  interested  in  any  real  estate  taken  or  affected  in such
      proceedings, or in whose favor any such  sum  or  sums  or  compensation
      shall  be  so  reported  shall  be under the age of twenty-one years, of
      unsound mind, or absent from the state of New  York,  and  also  in  all
      cases  where the name or names of the owner or owners, person or persons
      interested in any such real estate shall not be set forth  or  mentioned
      in  such  report,  or where the owner or owners, person or persons being
      named therein, can not upon diligent inquiry be found,  or  where  there
      are adverse or conflicting claims to the moneys awarded as compensation,
      it shall be lawful for the city to pay the sum or sums mentioned in such
      report,  payable,  or  that  would  be  coming  to such owner or owners,
      persons or persons respectively,  with  interest  aforesaid,  into  such
      trust  company  as the court may in the order of confirmation direct, to
      the credit of such owner or owners, person or persons, and such  payment
      shall  be  as  valid  and  effectual, in all respects as if made to such
      owner or owners, person  or  persons  interested  therein  respectively,
      themselves, according to their just rights. In all cases, however, where
      any  such  sum or sums or compensation, reported by the commissioners in
      favor of any person or persons or party or parties, whatsoever,  whether
      named or not named in such report shall be paid to any person or persons
      or party or parties, whomsoever, when the same shall of right belong and
      ought  to  have  been  paid to some other person or persons, or party or
      parties, it shall be lawful for  the  person  or  persons  or  party  or
      parties to whom the same ought to have been paid, to sue for and recover
      the same with lawful interest and costs of suit as so much money had and
      received  to  his,  her  or their use by the person or persons, party or
      parties, respectively, to whom the same shall have been so paid.
    
    
    
    
    
    
    

Section 5-397
-------------

Section 5-397 ::    
        
     
        §  5-397  Separate  reports by the commissioners. The commissioners of
      appraisal may, in their discretion,  take  up  any  specified  claim  or
      claims  and  finally ascertain and determine the compensation to be made
      thereon, and make a separate report with reference thereto, annexing  to
      such  report  a  copy  of  so much of the maps as displays the parcel or
      parcels so reported on. Such report as to the claims  therein  specified
      shall  be  the  report  required  in this subchapter, and the subsequent
      action with reference thereto shall be had in the same manner as  though
      no  other  claim were embraced in such proceeding, which, however, shall
      continue as to all claims upon which no such determination and report is
      made.
    
    
    
    
    
    
    

Section 5-398
-------------

Section 5-398 ::    
        
     
        §  5-398  Unforeseeable  damages; settlement or determination thereof.
      Whenever the owner of any private property any part of  or  interest  in
      which  shall  have  been taken under any proceeding had pursuant to this
      subchapter shall claim that the prosecution of any work done pursuant to
      such proceeding has been the proximate  cause  of  actual  and  material
      damage  to any part of such property and that commissioners of appraisal
      could not have taken cognizance of such damage pursuant to section 5-387
      of this subchapter, until the actual happening thereof  because  of  its
      unforeseeable   or  speculative  nature,  the  proper  person  or  board
      representing the city may agree with such owner as to the amount of such
      damages. If such agreement cannot be made, such owner may present to the
      commissioners of appraisal his or her claim in writing duly verified  on
      oath.  It shall be the duty of the commissioners to hear allegations and
      proofs and to proceed in like manner as  is  provided  in  the  case  of
      property  taken  pursuant  to  such  proceedings  as  aforesaid  and  to
      determine such actual damages,  if  any,  which  were  unforeseeable  or
      speculative  until  the  actual  happening  thereof.  The amount of such
      damages so agreed upon, if any, or so determined, shall be  payable  and
      collectible in the same manner as is provided in the case of awards made
      through  the  confirmation  of a report of commissioners of appraisal in
      such proceedings. In case at the time of making  any  such  claim  there
      shall  be  no  commissioners  authorized to take cognizance thereof, the
      corporation counsel, for and on  behalf  of  the  city,  shall  make  an
      application  for  the  appointment  of commissioners of appraisal in the
      manner prescribed by this subchapter, to take cognizance of such claims.
      Provided, however, that such claims shall be  presented  in  the  manner
      above  specified  within  two years from and after the completion of the
      work, the prosecution of which is claimed to  have  been  the  proximate
      cause  of such damage and that such claim shall be supported by proof of
      interest in the property alleged to have been damaged and of such damage
      and that it resulted proximately from the prosecution of such  work,  as
      aforesaid,   and  that  it  was  so  unforeseeable  or  speculative,  as
      aforesaid; and that the claim could not, with due diligence,  have  been
      presented  to  prior  commissioners  of  appraisal  subsequently  to the
      happening of the damage. In every case the payment of the amount  agreed
      upon  or determined or adjudged under and pursuant to this section shall
      be a continuing, complete, and conclusive bar to all claim of damage  by
      anyone  whomsoever  to the property concerned or any part thereof due to
      the prosecution of the work.
    
    
    
    
    
    
    

Section 5-399
-------------

Section 5-399 ::    
        
     
        §  5-399  Appeal  from  the report of the commissioners. Within twenty
      days after notice of the confirmation, modification or rejection of  the
      report  of  the  commissioners, as provided for in section 5-391 of this
      subchapter, either party may appeal, by notice in writing to  the  other
      party,  to  the  appellate division of the supreme court, from the order
      confirming, modifying or rejecting the report of the commissioners. Such
      appeal shall be heard on due notice thereof being  given,  according  to
      the rules and practice of such court. On the hearing of such appeal, the
      court  may affirm, modify or reverse the order of special term or it may
      direct a new appraisal and determination of any question passed upon, by
      the  same  or  new  commissioners,  in  its  discretion,  but  from  any
      determination of the appellate division, either party, if aggrieved, may
      take  an  appeal  which  shall  be  heard and determined by the court of
      appeals. If the amount of  compensation  to  be  made  by  the  city  is
      increased  after  a  new  trial,  the  difference  shall  be paid by the
      comptroller to the parties entitled to the same, or shall be  deposited,
      as the court may direct; and if the amount is diminished, the difference
      shall  be  refunded  to such city by the party to whom the same may have
      been paid, the judgment therefor may be rendered by the  court,  on  the
      filing  of  a  subsequent  decision, against the party liable to pay the
      same. But the taking of an appeal by any person  or  persons  shall  not
      operate  to stay the proceedings under this subchapter, except as to the
      particular parcel of real estate with which such  appeal  is  concerned.
      Such  appeal  shall  be  heard  upon  the  evidence  taken  before  such
      commissioners, and any affidavits as to irregularities submitted to  the
      court  at  special  term,  and three typewritten copies of such evidence
      shall be furnished by the city to the party taking the appeal within ten
      days after the appeal is perfected, and such appeals may be heard on the
      evidence so furnished, and such appeals may be  taken  without  security
      thereon.

Section 5-401 ::    
        
     
        § 5-401 Powers of the supreme court. The supreme court of the judicial
      district  in  which  the  real estate, or any part thereof, is situated,
      shall have power at any time to amend any defect or informality  in  any
      of  the  special  proceedings  authorized  by  this subchapter as may be
      necessary, or to cause other property to  be  included  therein  and  to
      direct  such  further  notice to be given to any party in interest as it
      deems proper, and also to appoint other commissioners in  place  of  any
      who shall die, or refuse or neglect to serve, or be incapable of serving
      or  be  removed.  Such  court  may  at  any  time  remove  any  of  such
      commissioners of appraisal who, in its judgment, shall be  incapable  of
      serving  or  who shall for any reason in its judgment be an unfit person
      to serve as such commissioner.  The  cause  of  such  removal  shall  be
      specified in the order making the same. If, in any particular, it shall,
      at  any time, be found necessary to amend any pleading or proceeding, or
      to supply any defect therein, arising  in  the  course  of  any  special
      proceeding  authorized  by this subchapter, the same may be corrected or
      supplied in such manner as may be directed by the supreme  court,  which
      is hereby authorized to make such amendment or correction.

-------------

Section 5-402 ::    
        
     
        §   5-402   Agreements   as   to  compensation.  The  commissioner  of
      environmental protection, subject  to  the  approval  of  the  board  of
      estimate,  may  agree with the owners and persons interested in any real
      estate laid down on such maps as to the amount  of  compensation  to  be
      paid  to  such  owners or persons interested for the taking or using and
      occupying such real estate. In case any such real estate shall be owned,
      occupied or enjoyed by the people of this state or by any  county,  town
      or  school district within this state, such rights, titles, interests or
      properties may be paid for upon agreement respectively with  the  office
      of  general  services, who shall act for the people of the state, with a
      chairman and a majority in numbers of the board of  supervisors  of  any
      county  who  shall  act  for  such  county, and with the supervisors and
      commissioner of highways, of any town who shall all act for  such  town,
      and  with  the  trustees  of  any school district who shall act for such
      district. The office of general services shall have power  to  grant  to
      the  city  any  real estate belonging to the people of this state, which
      may be required for the purposes indicated in this subchapter,  on  such
      terms   as  may  be  agreed  on  between  it  and  the  commissioner  of
      environmental protection, always, however, reserving and maintaining the
      rights of the people and riparian owners to go to the water at any point
      to which the same may be drawn. If any real estate of any  county,  town
      or  school  district  is  required  by the city for the purposes of this
      subchapter the majority of the board  of  supervisors  acting  for  such
      county,  or  the supervisors of any such town, with the commissioners of
      highway therein acting for such town, or  the  trustees  of  any  school
      district  acting  for  such  district,  may grant or surrender such real
      estate for such compensation as may be agreed upon between such officers
      respectively and the commissioner of environmental protection.

Section 5-403 ::    
        
     
        §  5-403 Definitions; special provision concerning acquisition of real
      estate used for public purposes. The term real estate as  used  in  this
      subchapter  shall be construed to signify and embrace all uplands, lands
      under water, the waters of any lake, pond or stream, all water rights or
      privileges, and any and all easements and incorporated hereditaments and
      every estate, interest and right, legal and equitable, in land or water,
      including terms for  years,  and  liens  thereon  by  way  of  judgment,
      mortgages  or  otherwise,  and  also  all claims for damage to such real
      estate. It shall also be construed to include all real  estate  (as  the
      term  is  above  defined)  heretofore  or hereafter required or used for
      railroad, highway or other public purposes,  providing  the  persons  or
      corporations owning such real estate or claiming interest therein, shall
      be  allowed  the  perpetual use for such purposes of the same or of such
      other real estate to be acquired for the purposes of this subchapter  as
      will  afford practicable route or location for such railroad, highway or
      other public purpose, and in the case of a railroad,  commensurate  with
      and  adapted  to  its  needs;  and  provided  also  that such persons or
      corporations shall not directly or indirectly  be  subject  to  expense,
      loss  or  damage  by reason of changing such route or location, but that
      such expense, loss or damage shall be borne by the  city.  In  case  any
      real  estate  so  acquired, or used for public purposes, is sought to be
      taken or affected for the purposes of this  subchapter  there  shall  be
      designated  upon  the  maps referred to in the previous sections of this
      subchapter, and there shall be described in the  petition,  hereinbefore
      referred  to,  such  portion of the other real estate shown on such maps
      and described in such petition, as it is proposed to substitute in place
      of the real estate then used for such railroad, highway or other  public
      purposes.  Provided,  that  wherever  the  commissioner of environmental
      protection has heretofore located on any map filed in the office of  the
      commissioners  of  appraisal,  a substituted route for any railroad, the
      same shall not be  subsequently  changed  without  the  assent  of  such
      company.  The supreme court at the special term to which the petition is
      presented or at such other special term as the consideration thereof may
      be adjourned to, shall either approve the substituted route or refer the
      same back to the commissioner of environmental protection for alteration
      or amendment and may refer  the  same  back,  with  such  directions  or
      suggestions  as such court may deem advisable, and as often as necessary
      and until such commissioners shall determine such substituted  route  as
      may  be  approved  by  the  court. An appeal from any order made by such
      court at special term, under the provisions  of  this  section,  may  be
      taken  by  any person or corporation interested in and aggrieved thereby
      to the appellate division and court of appeals, and shall be heard as  a
      non-enumerated  motion.  The  commissioners  of  appraisal, hereinbefore
      referred to, in determining the compensation to be made to  the  persons
      or  corporations  owning such real estate, or claiming interest therein,
      shall include in the amount of such compensation such sum  as  shall  be
      sufficient  to  defray  the  expenses of making such change of route and
      location and of building such railroad or highway. Such commissioners of
      appraisal shall suggest in their report, and  the  court  in  the  order
      confirming  such  report  shall  determine,  subject  to  review  by the
      appellate division, what reasonable time after payment of the awards  to
      such  persons  or  corporations  shall  be  sufficient  within  which to
      complete the work of making such  change.  Neither  the  city,  nor  the
      commissioner  of  environmental  protection  shall  be  entitled to take
      possession or interfere with  the  use  of  such  real  estate  for  the
      enumerated  purposes,  before the expiration of such time. Such time may
      be subsequently extended by the court (subject to review  as  aforesaid)
      upon  a  sufficient  cause  shown.  After the expiration of this time so
    
      determined or extended no use shall be made of such  real  estate  which
      shall  cause  pollution to the water in such reservoir or interfere with
      its flow.

      of  appraisal appointed in pursuance of this subchapter shall receive as
      compensation such fees and expenses as may be taxed by  the  court  upon
      notice  to  the corporation counsel who shall also furnish them with the
      necessary clerks, stenographers,  surveyors  and  other  employees.  The
      corporation  counsel  shall,  either in person, or by such assistants or
      other counsel as he or she shall designate for the purpose,  appear  for
      and  protect the interests of the city in all proceedings in court under
      this  subchapter  including  the  taxation  of  fees,  compensation  and
      expenses  and  proceedings  before  the  commissioners.  The fees of the
      commissioners and the salaries and compensation of their employees,  and
      their necessary traveling expenses, and all other necessary expenses, in
      and  about the special proceedings provided by this subchapter to be had
      for acquiring title or extinguishing claims for damages to real  estate,
      and  such  allowances  for  counsel  fees as may be made by order of the
      court shall be paid  by  the  comptroller  out  of  the  funds  provided
      therefor.  Such fees and expenses shall not be paid until they have been
      taxed before a justice of the supreme court in the judicial district  in
      which  the  lands  or  some  part  thereof are situated upon eight days'
      notice to the corporation counsel. Such  allowances  shall  in  no  case
      exceed  the  limits  prescribed  by section eight thousand three hundred
      three of the civil practice law and rules. The salaries and compensation
      of the persons employed, as provided for in this subchapter, to  prepare
      the necessary surveys, plans and estimates and for other purposes and to
      direct,  supervise  and  inspect  the work required to be done under the
      provisions of this subchapter, and such other expenses in and about  the
      same  as  are  not  herein  required  to  be  under  contracts let after
      completion, shall be paid by the comptroller on the certification of the
      commissioner of environmental protection or of such person or persons as
      the commissioner may designate. The compensation and expenses of such of
      the corporation counsel's assistants or other counsel as the corporation
      counsel may designate to represent  and  aid  the  commissioner  in  the
      performance  of  his  or  her duties under this subchapter shall also be
      paid out of the funds provided therefor, and upon the certificate of the
      corporation counsel who shall have power to appoint such  assistants  or
      other  counsel, and to fix their compensation. The various sums of money
      growing due from time to time, under the terms of the several contracts,
      made for the doing of the work and furnishing the material  required  by
      this  subchapter,  shall be paid by the comptroller on the certification
      of the commissioner  of  environmental  protection  or  such  person  or
      persons as the commissioner may from time to time designate.

        §  5-423  Damage  to value of real property; businesses, and employees
      thereof. a. The owner of any real estate not taken  by  virtue  of  this
      subchapter  and article fifteen of the environmental conservation law or
      of any established business on the first day of June,  nineteen  hundred
      five,  except  as  hereinafter  provided, and situate in the counties of
      Ulster, Albany or Greene, directly or indirectly decreased in  value  by
      reason  of  the  acquiring  of  land by the city for an additional water
      supply or by reason of the execution of any plans  for  such  additional
      water  supply  by  the  city under the provisions of this subchapter and
      article fifteen of the environmental conservation law, his or her heirs,
      assigns or personal representatives shall have a right  to  damages  for
      such decrease in value. The owner of any real estate not taken by virtue
      of  this  subchapter  or of any established business on the first day of
      December, nineteen hundred fourteen,  except  as  hereinafter  provided,
      situate  in  the  counties  of  Ulster,  Greene,  Delaware or Schoharie,
      directly or indirectly decreased in value by reason of the  acquisition,
      after  the  passage  of  this  subchapter  of  land  by  the city for an
      additional water supply from the Schoharie watershed, or  by  reason  of
      the  execution  of  any plans for such additional water supply from such
      watershed, under the provisions of this subchapter, his or  her  assigns
      or  personal  representatives,  shall  have  a right to damages for such
      decrease in value. The owner of any real estate, not taken,  situate  in
      any one or more of the counties of Ulster, Delaware, Orange or Sullivan,
      or  of  any  established  business,  directly or indirectly decreased in
      value by reason of the execution of any plans for or by the  acquisition
      of  land  by  the  city for a water supply from the Rondout and Delaware
      watersheds except that portion of the Delaware  watershed  of  the  west
      branch  of  the Delaware river within such counties, or any of them, and
      the owner of any real estate, not taken, situate in any one or  more  of
      such  counties  or  situate  in  the  corporate limits of the village of
      Deposit in the county of Broome existing on  the  first  day  of  April,
      nineteen  hundred  fifty-nine,  or  of  any  established business, which
      business was established on or prior to the first day of April, nineteen
      hundred fifty-nine which is directly or indirectly decreased in value by
      reason of the execution of any plans for or by the acquistion of land by
      the city for a water supply from the watershed of the west branch of the
      Delaware river, pursuant to law, his or her or its assigns, or  personal
      representatives  in any such case shall have a right to damages for such
      decrease in value, from the time of the beginning of  such  decrease  in
      value,  provided,  however, that in the case of an established business,
      the recovery of or award made to any  claimant  shall  not  include  any
      business  that may have resulted by reason of the execution of any plans
      for such water supply. The commissioner of environmental protection  may
      agree  with  such  person  as to the amount of such damages, and if such
      agreement can not be made such damages, if any, shall be  determined  in
      the  manner  herein  provided  for  the ascertaining and determining the
      value of real estate taken under the provisions of this subchapter,  and
      the  commissioners  shall not be limited in the reception of evidence to
      the rules  regulating  the  proof  of  direct  damages.  They  may  also
      recommend  such sums, if any, as shall seem to them proper to be allowed
      to parties appearing in the proceeding, as expenses  and  disbursements,
      including  reasonable  compensation  for  witnesses.  The amount of such
      damages so agreed upon as aforesaid or determined as aforesaid shall  be
      payable  and collectible in the same manner as is herein provided in the
      case  of  awards  made  through  the  confirmation  of   a   report   of
      commissioners of appraisal.
        b.  A  person  employed  in  a  manufacturing  establishment, or in an
      established business, or upon any lands, and who is not an owner or part
    
      owner thereof or of any interest therein, in  the  counties  of  Ulster,
      Delaware,   Orange  and  Sullivan,  which  manufacturing  establishment,
      established business or lands is injured or  destroyed  because  of  the
      acquisition by the city of an additional water supply from any watershed
      within  such counties, except the watershed tributary to the west branch
      of the Delaware river, or which lands are taken  or  acquired  for  like
      purpose  by  the  city  and a person who was employed in a manufacturing
      establishment or in an established business or  upon  any  lands  within
      such  counties  or  in the corporate limits of the village of Deposit in
      the county of Broome and who is not an owner or part owner thereof or of
      any interest therein, which manufacturing establishment  or  established
      business  or  lands is injured or destroyed because of an acquisition by
      the city of an additional water supply from the watershed  of  the  west
      branch  of  the Delaware river, or which lands are taken or acquired for
      like purpose by the city, and who in any such case has been so  employed
      continuously  for  six  months  prior  to,  and  who  continues  in such
      employment up to  the  time  of  such  injury,  destruction,  taking  or
      acquisition,  shall  have  a claim for damages against the city equal to
      the salary paid such employee for the six months  immediately  preceding
      such  injury,  destruction,  taking  or acquisition. Such damages may be
      determined  by  agreement  with  the   commissioner   of   environmental
      protection.  In  case  such  agreement can not be made such employee may
      maintain an action against the city in the supreme court to recover such
      damages, not, however, to exceed the sum of wages paid the employee  for
      the   six   months   preceding   such  injury,  destruction,  taking  or
      acquisition.
