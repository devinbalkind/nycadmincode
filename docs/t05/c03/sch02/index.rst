Section 5-342
-------------

Section 5-342 ::    
        
     
        §  5-342  Construction.  The  provisions  of  this subchapter shall be
      construed as supplementing and extending the effect of the provisions of
      subchapter one of this chapter so as to provide for the  acquisition  of
      title  to additional lands in connection with an improvement and nothing
      in this subchapter contained shall be construed as limiting  the  effect
      of  the  provisions  of  such subchapter one in their application to the
      acquisition of title to real property required for an  improvement  when
      acquired in a proceeding in which additional lands shall or shall not be
      acquired,  except  as  the provisions of such subchapter one are in this
      subchapter expressly so limited in their application.
    
    
    
    
    
    
    

Section 5-343
-------------

Section 5-343 ::    
        
     
        §  5-343  Power  to  condemn excess lands. The city, in acquiring real
      property for any improvement, may acquire more  real  property  than  is
      needed  for  the  actual  construction of the improvement. The mayor may
      authorize the city to acquire additional  real  property  in  connection
      with any improvement, and direct that the same be acquired with the real
      property  to  be  acquired  for  the  improvement.  Such additional real
      property, however, shall be not more than sufficient  to  form  suitable
      building  sites  abutting  on  the improvement. The title which the city
      shall acquire to additional real property shall in every case be  a  fee
      simple  absolute. Additional real property shall be acquired by the city
      in connection with a street improvement only when the title acquired for
      the improvement shall be in fee. When the mayor  shall  have  authorized
      the  acquisition of title to additional real property in connection with
      an improvement, title to such additional real property shall be acquired
      by the city in the manner and according to the procedure, except in such
      respects as in this subchapter set forth, provided for  the  acquisition
      of  title  to  the real property required for the improvement and in the
      same proceeding in which title to the real  property  required  for  the
      improvement  shall  be  acquired;  except  further that such acquisition
      shall be made in compliance  with  the  appropriate  provisions  of  the
      eminent domain procedure law.
    
    
    
    
    
    
    

Section 5-344
-------------

Section 5-344 ::    
        
     
        §  5-344  Amendment  of  improvement  proceeding to include or exclude
      excess lands. After the institution of a proceeding for an  improvement,
      the  mayor  may  amend  the proceeding by authorizing the acquisition of
      lands additional to those required for the  improvement,  provided  that
      title  shall  not have vested in the city to any parcel of real property
      to be acquired for the improvement within  the  block,  between  legally
      existing  public  streets,  embracing  the additional lands sought to be
      acquired.  The mayor may also amend any proceeding so as to exclude  any
      or all additional lands being acquired in the proceeding, provided title
      to  such  additional lands shall not have vested in the city. Thereafter
      the proceeding  shall  be  conducted  in  the  same  manner  as  if  the
      additional lands included or excluded by the amendment had been included
      or  had  not  been  included  in  the  proceeding  at  the  time  of the
      institution thereof.
    
    
    
    
    
    
    

Section 5-345
-------------

Section 5-345 ::    
        
     
        § 5-345 Damage maps to be prepared. When the mayor shall authorize the
      acquisition   of   additional  real  property  in  connection  with  any
      improvement, the mayor shall cause to be prepared and  shall  approve  a
      map  showing  the  real  property to be acquired for the improvement and
      such additional real property in connection with the real property to be
      acquired for the improvement, and such map shall be filed, prior to  the
      application  to  condemn  the  same, as follows: One copy thereof in the
      office in which conveyances of real property are required by law  to  be
      recorded  in  each county in which the real property or any part thereof
      shown on such map is situated; one copy thereof in  the  office  of  the
      corporation  counsel; one copy thereof in the office of the president of
      each borough in which the real property or any  part  thereof  shown  on
      such map is situated; and one copy thereof in the office of the mayor.
    
    
    
    
    
    
    

Section 5-346
-------------

Section 5-346 ::    
        
     
        §  5-346 Petition and notice. When the mayor shall have authorized the
      acquisition  of  additional  real  property  in  connection   with   any
      improvement, such additional real property shall be separately described
      in  the notice of application to condemn by the supreme court and in the
      petition presented on any such application, and separately shown on  the
      rule  map  attached  to  the  petition  and  on  the  damage  map in the
      proceeding, and such notice and petition shall state what  part  of  the
      real  property to be condemned is required for the improvement, and what
      part thereof  is  to  be  acquired  as  additional  real  property.  The
      acquisition  of  such  additional  real property, when authorized by the
      mayor, shall be deemed to be for a public purpose.
    
    
    
    
    
    
    

Section 5-347
-------------

Section 5-347 ::    
        
     
        §  5-347  Vesting  of title; seizin; possession. a. In a proceeding in
      which additional real property shall be acquired, the mayor shall direct
      that on the date of entry of  the  order  granting  the  application  to
      acquire  by  the  supreme court the title to the whole but not less than
      the whole of such  additional  real  property  to  be  acquired  in  the
      proceeding  shall  vest  in  the  city. Such order shall also direct the
      vesting in such city, simultaneously, of the title to all  of  the  real
      property  being  acquired  in  the  proceeding for the improvement. In a
      proceeding  involving  the  acquisition  of  title  to  additional  real
      property  required  for  a street, highway or public place, however, the
      mayor shall not be required to vest, at one time, the title to  all  the
      additional real property to be acquired, provided that:
        1.  In  vesting  title to parts of such additional real property every
      such part shall be of at least a block length along the improvement, and
      no fractional portion of a block shall be contained in  any  such  part,
      and
        2. The mayor shall also direct that all the real property required for
      the  street,  highway or public place in such block or blocks shall vest
      in the city simultaneously.
        b. Upon the date of the entry of the order granting the application to
      acquire, the city shall be and become seized in fee simple  absolute  to
      such  additional  real  property.  The  reversal  on appeal of the final
      decree, or of any part thereof, shall not operate to divest the city  of
      title  to any of the real property so acquired. In a proceeding in which
      excess lands shall be acquired, the mayor shall not have power to direct
      the vesting of title in the city to the real property required  for  the
      improvement  without  also  directing  the vesting of title in the city,
      simultaneously, to the excess lands being acquired in the proceeding  in
      connection  with  the  improvement, except that the mayor may direct, in
      the manner provided in subdivision a of this section, that title to  the
      real  property required for a street, highway or public place shall vest
      in the city in any  block  of  such  street,  highway  or  public  place
      abutting which no excess lands are taken.
        c.  In  any  proceeding  in which excess lands shall be acquired, when
      title to any part less than the whole of the real property required  for
      the  street,  highway  or public place in any one block thereof, between
      legally existing public streets, shall vest in the city,  title  to  the
      remainder  of  the  real  property  required  for the street, highway or
      public place in the same block and title to the additional lands  to  be
      acquired  in  the  proceeding  abutting on the street, highway or public
      place in the same block, shall vest  in  the  city  simultaneously.  The
      reversal  on  appeal  of  the  final decree of the court, or of any part
      thereof, shall not operate to divest the city of title  to  any  of  the
      real property so acquired for the street, highway or public place in the
      same block or to the additional lands abutting thereon.
        d. Upon the vesting of title, as in this section provided, to any such
      additional lands and to lands required for the improvement, the city, or
      any  person  acting under its authority, may immediately, or at any time
      thereafter, take possession of the additional lands so vested and of the
      real property required for the improvement so vested,  or  any  part  or
      parts  thereof,  in accordance with the provisions of the eminent domain
      procedure law pertaining to possession.
    
    
    
    
    
    
    

Section 5-348
-------------

Section 5-348 ::    
        
     
        §  5-348 Ascertainment of damages where part of parcel is taken for an
      improvement and remainder as excess lands. a. Where part of a parcel  of
      real property shall be acquired for an improvement, and the remainder or
      a portion of the remainder of such parcel in the same ownership shall be
      acquired  in  the  same  proceeding  as excess lands, the portion of the
      damages due to the acquisition of the real  property  required  for  the
      improvement  shall  be  determined and stated separately from the entire
      damage due to each such owner. In determining the  damages  due  to  the
      acquisition  of  so  much  of  such  parcel  as  may be required for the
      improvement, the  same  rule  shall  be  applied  as  would  govern  the
      determination  of  damages  for the taking of the real property required
      for the improvement in case no excess lands were acquired. Where part of
      a parcel of real property shall be acquired for the improvement, and the
      remainder or a portion of the remainder thereof in  the  same  ownership
      shall  be  acquired  in the same proceeding as excess lands, the damages
      due to the acquisition of title to the real property  required  for  the
      improvement,  shall,  in  every  case,  equal  the amount which would be
      awarded to such owner in  case  only  that  part  of  his  or  her  real
      property, which shall be required for the improvement, were acquired.
        b.  Nothing  in this section contained shall be construed to authorize
      the award to an owner, part of whose real  property  is  taken  for  the
      improvement,  and  the  remainder or a portion of the remainder of whose
      property  is  taken  as  additional  lands,  any   greater   amount   of
      compensation than such owner shall be entiled to by reason of the taking
      of his or her real property for the improvement and as additional lands,
      considered together as one parcel.
    
    
    
    
    
    
    

Section 5-349
-------------

Section 5-349 ::    
        
     
        §  5-349 Payments of awards and interest. The provisions of subchapter
      one of this chapter relative to the payment by the comptroller  of  sums
      awarded  as  damages and interest thereon, and to the advance payment on
      account of such damages, and relative to the  assignment  or  pledge  of
      awards,  shall  apply  to awards or damages for the taking of additional
      lands. Interest on the entire amount due  to  the  owner  for  the  real
      property  acquired  for the improvement, or for the excess lands, or for
      both, from the date of the vesting of title thereto to the date  of  the
      final decree shall be awarded as a part of such owner's compensation.
    
    
    
    
    
    
    

Section 5-350
-------------

Section 5-350 ::    
        
     
        § 5-350 Sale and lease of acquired excess lands. a. After title to the
      real property required for the improvement, and to the additional lands,
      shall  have  vested in the city, the additional lands may be either held
      and used by the city, or sold or leased in the manner  provided  by  the
      charter  as  long  as  consistent  with  the  provisions of section four
      hundred six of the eminent domain procedure law. The board  of  estimate
      may  provide  that such additional lands shall be sold or leased subject
      to  such  restrictions,  covenants  or  conditions  as  to  location  of
      buildings   with  reference  to  the  real  property  acquired  for  the
      improvement, or the height of buildings or structures, or the  character
      of  construction  and  architecture  thereof,  or  such other covenants,
      conditions or restrictions as it may deem proper. Such additional  lands
      shall  be  sold  or  leased  subject  to such restrictions, covenants or
      conditions, if any, as the board of estimate may have prescribed,  which
      shall be set forth in the instrument of conveyance or lease.
        b.  Nothing  in  subdivision b of section three hundred eighty-four of
      the charter limiting the term of leases  by  the  city  to  a  different
      period  shall  apply to a lease by the city, acting through the board of
      estimate,  of  such  additional  real  property  for  housing  purposes,
      including stores on the street level.
