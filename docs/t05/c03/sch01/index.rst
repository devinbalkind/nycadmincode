      notice  to  all owners or their attorneys who have duly filed and served
      on the corporation counsel copies of  their  verified  claims.  For  the

      the  corporation  counsel shall designate, the corporation counsel shall
      at the expense of the city provide proper stenographic service and shall
      furnish to the  owner  bringing  on  such  examination  a  copy  of  the
      typewritten  transcript  of  such  examination,  duly  certified  by the

      provide proper stenographic service and shall furnish to the corporation
      counsel two copies of the typewritten  transcript  of  such  examination

      of  a  witness  need  not  be  subscribed  by  such  witness,  if   such
      subscription  shall be waived by the parties appearing upon the witness'
      examination. The corporation counsel, at the office  address  subscribed
      by  him  or  her upon the papers in the proceeding, shall from and after

      have  proved their title or have failed to do so after being notified by
      the corporation counsel of the time and place when and where such  proof
      of  title would be received by him or her, the corporation counsel shall
      serve upon all parties or their  attorneys  who  have  appeared  in  the
      proceeding  a  note  of issue as provided in section five hundred six of
      the eminent domain procedure law. The clerk of the court must  thereupon

      law.  Where  title to real property being acquired in a proceeding shall
      have been vested in the city, and  buildings  or  improvements  situated
      thereon  shall have been removed or destroyed by the city or pursuant to
      its authority prior to the trial of  the  proceeding,  and  whereby  the
      justice  trying the proceeding is deprived of a view of the buildings or
      improvements so removed or destroyed, the fact that the justice has  not
      had  a  view  thereof shall not preclude the court from receiving on the
      trial of the  proceeding  testimony  and  evidence,  as  to  the  damage
      sustained  by the claimant by reason of the taking thereof, when offered
      on behalf of either the claimant or the city.

      other  terms upon any lease, relating to any of the property taken or to
      be taken or to any other property in  the  vicinity  thereof,  shall  be
      relevant,  material and competent, upon the issue of value or damage and
      shall be admissible on direct examination if the court  shall  find  the
      following:
        1.  That  such  sale or lease was made within a reasonable time of the

      that it relates to property which is similar to the property taken or to
      be taken.
        No such evidence, however, shall be  admissible  as  to  any  sale  or
      lease,  which  shall  not have been the subject of an examination before
      trial either at the instance of the city or of an owner, unless at least
      twenty days before the trial the attorney for  the  party  proposing  to
      offer  such  evidence  shall  have served a written notice in respect of
      such sale or lease, which notice shall specify the names  and  addresses

      the proceeding; or if served on behalf of an owner, shall be served upon
      the corporation counsel and upon all other owners or their attorneys who
      have appeared in the proceeding. The testimony of a witness as to his or
      her opinion or estimate of value or damage shall be incompetent,  if  it
      shall appear that such opinion or estimate is based upon a sale or lease
      of any of the property taken or to be taken or of any of the property in
      the  vicinity  thereof,  which  shall  not  have  been the subject of an
      examination before trial, unless it  shall  have  been  specified  in  a
      notice  served  as  aforesaid  or shall have occurred within twenty days
      before the trial.
        b. Upon the trial, no map or  plan  of  proposed  streets,  drains  or

      any  other  structure or improvement not existing on the property on the
      date that title thereto may vest in the city, nor any  oral  or  written
      estimate  or  cost  or  expense  of  constructing the streets, drains or
      sewers in conformity with such map or plan,  nor  any  oral  or  written
      estimate  of  the cost of making such excavation or filling or piling or
      of constructing any such other  proposed  structure  or  improvement  in
      conformity  with  such  drawing  or other specification thereof, nor any
      evidence of value of damage based upon any of the  foregoing,  shall  be
      received  in  evidence,  unless  the party offering the same in evidence
      shall have served upon the adverse party, at least thirty days prior  to
      the trial, a notice of intention to offer such evidence on the trial and
      of  the particulars thereof, including a true copy of the map or plan or
      drawing and other specifications and estimate of cost or expense  to  be
      so  offered  in  evidence,  provided,  however,  that  when offered such
      evidence shall be subject to objection upon any legal ground.
        c. Upon the trial, no evidence shall be admitted, as against an  owner
      of  real  property  being  acquired, of an offer made by or on behalf of
    
      such owner for the sale of his or her property or any  part  thereof  to
      the  city,  or  for the sale or assignment of any right and title to the
      award or awards, or any part thereof, to be made for  such  property  or
      any part thereof, in the proceeding; nor shall any evidence be received,
      as  against  the  city,  of  any  offer made to such owner, by or on its

      sets of the tax maps of the city in duplicate for filing therein and for
      convenience of reference thereto in the tabular  abstract  of  estimated
      damage.  The  surveyor  of the finance department shall make and furnish
      all necessary surveys and corrections of the section maps, necessary  to
      keep  the  maps  furnished  to  the  corporation  counsel as accurate as
      practicable.
        d. Such tabular abstract or abstracts shall be signed by  the  justice
      trying  the  proceeding  and  filed  with  the clerk of the court in the
      county in which the order granting the application to condemn was  filed
      and  when  so  filed  such  abstract  or  abstracts shall constitute the
      tentative decree of the court as to awards for damages.

        §  5-318  Agreements for compensation to be awarded for the removal of
      structures from premises being acquired. a.  The  mayor,  prior  to  the
      purchase  of  the premises being acquired, upon which buildings or parts
      of buildings or other structures are erected, or prior to the signing of
      the final decree of the court,  may  agree  with  the  owner  or  owners
      thereof,  or  any  person  having a beneficial interest therein, in case
      title thereto has not vested in the city:
        1. As to the cost and compensation to be allowed and paid to  them  to
      remove such buildings or parts of buildings or other structures, and
        2.  That  such  sum or sums shall be the compensation to be awarded by
      the court, or allowed for the damage done such  buildings  or  parts  of
      buildings or other structures by virtue of such proceeding.
        Such  agreement  may  also  be  made as a condition of the sale by the
      city, at private sale, of its interest in such  buildings  or  parts  of
      buildings  or  other  structures, after vesting of title thereto, to the
      owner or owners of the award or awards therefor or other persons  having
      an interest therein.
        b. Such buildings or parts of buildings or other structures shall not,
      in any case, be relocated or re-erected within the lines of any proposed
      street  or  other  public  improvement.  The  mayor shall prescribe such
      conditions in the terms of sale, which, if  broken,  shall  entitle  the
      city  to  a resale of such property and which shall revest title thereto
      in the city.
        c. The court shall accept such agreed amounts of compensation for  the
      removal  of  buildings  or parts of buildings or other structures as the
      amounts to be awarded as such compensation and include the same  in  the
      tentative and final decrees.

Section 5-319 ::    
        
     
        § 5-319 Separate and partial tentative and final decrees. a. The court
      upon  the  authorization  of  the mayor, may make a separate and partial
      tentative decree and a separate and partial final decree  embracing  the
      entire  real  property being acquired therein, or successive sections or
      parcels thereof.
        b. Whenever a separate and  partial  tentative  and  final  decree  or
      decrees  shall have been authorized, the corporation counsel may file in
      the office of the county clerk and in the office  in  which  instruments
      affecting  real  property  are  required to be recorded in the county in
      which the order granting the application to condemn is filed,  a  survey
      or  map showing the part of the real property being acquired as to which
      a separate and partial tentative and final decree has  been  authorized,
      subdivided  into parcels corresponding with separate ownerships thereof,
      as far as ascertained, and the corporation counsel and the  court  shall
      proceed  with  the  ascertainment  and determination of the damages with
      relation to the real property shown on such partial damage  map  in  the
      same  manner  as  provided  for  the  ascertainment and determination of
      damages with relation to  the  entire  real  property  embraced  in  the
      proceeding.
        c.  In  case  a  separate  and  partial  final decree or decrees as to
      damage, including part of  the  real  property  being  acquired  in  the
      proceeding,  shall  have  been made or filed therein and the justice who
      made and filed the separate and partial final decree or  decrees  as  to
      damage   shall   have   died  or  retired  from  the  bench,  or  become
      incapacitated for any reason, the  corporation  counsel  and  the  court
      shall  proceed  with  the ascertainment and determination of damage with
      relation to the remaining real property damaged in the  same  manner  as
      provided for the ascertainment and determination of damage with relation
      to the entire real property being acquired and shall make a separate and
      partial  tentative  and  final  decree  as  to damage as to all the real
      property being acquired in the proceeding, which  shall  not  have  been
      included  in  prior separate and partial final decrees as to damage. All
      provisions of this subchapter relating to tentative  and  final  decrees
      shall  apply  to  the separate and partial final decrees as to damage so
      made, provided, however, that the provision making it the  duty  of  the
      justice  to view the property being acquired shall not apply in case the
      buildings or improvements on the property  or  the  part  thereof  being
      acquired shall have been removed or destroyed by the city or pursuant to
      its  authority  prior to the time the matter shall have been assigned to
      such justice for trial.

Section 5-320 ::    
        
     
        §  5-320  Notice to file objections; objections; hearings. a. Upon the
      filing of the  tentative  decree  the  corporation  counsel  shall  give
      notice,  by  advertisement  in  the  City  Record, of the filing of such
      tentative decree and that the city and all other parties  interested  in
      such  proceedings,  or  in  any  of  the real property affected thereby,
      having an objection thereto, shall file  such  objections,  in  writing,
      duly  verified  in  the  manner  required by law for the verification of
      pleadings in an action, setting forth the real  property  owned  by  the
      objector,  and  such  objector's  post  office address, in the office in
      which the tentative decree was filed  within  fifteen  days  after  such
      publication  in  a  capital  project proceeding. Such notice shall be so
      published for a period of ten days  in  a  captial  project  proceeding.
      Similar  notice shall be given of the filing of any new, supplemental or
      amended tentative decree, and for the filing of objections thereto.  The
      notice  shall  further  state  that  the  corporation  counsel on a date
      specified in the notice will apply to the justice who made the tentative
      decree to fix a time when he or she  will  hear  the  parties  objecting
      thereto.
        b.  After  the  filing  of  the  tentative  decree  or  of any new, or
      supplemental, or amended tentative decree, no award for damages shall be
      diminished without notice to the owner of the real property affected  or
      the  owner's  attorney  appearing  in  the proceeding and an opportunity
      given for a hearing in regard thereto before signing the final decree.
        c. Every party objecting  to  the  tentative  decree  or  to  the  new
      supplemental  or  amended  tentative  decree  or  such party's attorney,
      within the time specified in the notice to file objections, shall  serve
      on the corporation counsel a copy of such verified objections.
        d.  Upon the application of the corporation counsel, the justice shall
      fix the time when he or she will  hear  the  parties  so  objecting  and
      desiring  to  be  heard. At the time so fixed the justice shall hear the
      person or persons who have objected to the tentative decree, or  to  the
      new,  supplemental  or  amended  tentative  decree, and who may then and
      there appear, and shall have the power to  adjourn  from  time  to  time
      until  all  parties who have filed objections and who desire to be heard
      shall have been fully heard.

Section 5-321 ::    
        
     
        §  5-321  Final decree; preparation thereof; what to contain. a. After
      considering the objections,  if  any,  and  making  any  corrections  or
      alterations in the tentative decree as to awards for damage, the justice
      trying the proceeding shall give instructions to the corporation counsel
      as  to the preparation of the final decree. Such decree shall consist of
      the tentative decree, altered  and  corrected  in  accordance  with  the
      instructions  of  the justice; of the final awards, as determined by the
      court, set opposite the respective damage parcel  numbers  in  a  column
      headed  "final award" in the tabular abstract of awards for damage; of a
      statement of the facts conferring upon the  court  jurisdiction  of  the
      proceeding;  and  of such other matters as the court shall require to be
      set forth. The final decree shall also  contain  a  statement  that  the
      amounts  set opposite the respective damage parcel numbers in the column
      headed "final awards" in the  tabular  abstract  of  awards  for  damage
      constitute and are the just compensation which the respective owners are
      entitled to receive from the city. The final decree shall also set forth
      the  names of the respective owners of the several parcels acquired, but
      in all cases where the owners are unknown or  not  fully  known  to  the
      court, it shall be sufficient to set forth and state in general terms in
      the  decree  the respective sums to be allowed and paid to the owners of
      the respective parcels for loss  and  damage  without  specifying  their
      names or their estates or interests therein, and in such case the owners
      may be specified as unknown.
        b.  To  the final decree shall be attached the surveys, diagrams, maps
      or plans  referred  to  in  subdivision  a  of  section  5-315  of  this
      subchapter,  duly corrected, when necessary. Such decree shall set forth
      the several parcels taken by reference to the numbers of such parcels on
      the respective surveys, diagrams, maps or plans, and  it  shall  not  be
      necessary to describe any parcels acquired by metes and bounds.
        c. Should any errors exist in the tentative decree, or in the surveys,
      diagrams, maps or plans attached thereto, or should there occur, between
      the  date  of  the  tentative  decree and the time of the signing by the
      court of the final decree, any changes in ownership resulting in changes
      in the size of area, by subdivision or otherwise, of any of the  parcels
      of any real property to be acquired, the court may alter and correct the
      respective surveys, diagrams, maps or plans to show such changes in such
      final  decree.  At  the time of the entry of the final decree, the court
      shall direct that the maps furnished to the corporation counsel  in  the
      proceeding  shall  be revised and altered in agreement with the tax maps
      as of the date of the entry of such decree.
    
    
    
    
    
    
    

Section 5-322

Section 5-322 ::    
        
     
        §  5-322  Filing of final decree as to damage where objections and the
      filing of a tentative decree are waived. a.  Notwithstanding  any  other
      provision  of  this  subchapter, in any case where the owner of any real
      property affected by any proceeding under this subchapter or the owner's
      attorney and the corporation counsel enter into an agreement in  writing
      whereby  it  is  agreed  that  with  respect  to the award of damages in
      relation to such property, the filing of a tentative decree, the  giving
      of  notice  to  file objections and the filing and hearing of objections
      are waived, the filing of a tentative decree, the giving of such  notice
      and  the  hearing  of  objections in relation to such award shall not be
      required.
        b. In a capital project proceeding, the court may make a separate  and
      partial  final  decree  or  decrees  determining the final awards to any
      owners of real property affected by the proceeding who have entered into
      such waiver agreements or in whose behalf such agreements have been made
      by their attorneys, or where such agreements have been so  entered  into
      by  or  in  behalf  of  all  owners  of  real  property affected by such
      proceeding, the court may make a  final  decree  determining  the  final
      awards  to  such  owners.  In  accordance  with  the procedure regularly
      governing where the provisions of subdivision a of this section are  not
      applicable,  the  court  may make such separate and partial tentative or
      final or other decrees as may be appropriate for  the  determination  of
      awards  to  owners  of real property affected by the proceeding who have
      not entered into such agreements and in  whose  behalf  such  agreements
      have not been made by their attorneys.
        c.   1.  Any  separate  and  partial  final  decree  or  final  decree
      determining final awards to owners of real property by whom or in  whose
      behalf  such  waiver  agreements  have  been  so  entered  into shall be
      prepared by the corporation counsel in accordance with the  instructions
      of the justice trying the proceeding, and shall set forth the following:
        (a)  such  awards,  as  determined  by  the  court,  set  opposite the
      respective damage parcel numbers;
        (b) the facts conferring jurisdiction over  the  proceeding  upon  the
      court and such other matters as the court shall require to be included;
        (c)  a  statement  that the amounts set opposite the respective damage
      parcel numbers constitute and are just compensation which the respective
      owners are entitled to receive from the city; and
        (d) the  names  of  the  respective  owners  of  the  several  parcels
      acquired,  as  far  as  the same shall have been ascertained, but in all
      cases where the owners are unknown or not fully known to the  court,  it
      shall  be  sufficient  to  set  forth  and state in general terms in the
      decree the respective sums to be allowed and paid to the owners  of  the
      respective  parcels  for loss and damage, without specifying their names
      or their estates or interests therein, and in such case the  owners  may
      be specified as unknown.
        2.  If  any such decree is the first separate and partial final decree
      or final decree filed  in  such  proceeding,  there  shall  be  attached
      thereto  the surveys, diagrams, maps or plans referred to in subdivision
      a of section 5-315 of this subchapter, duly corrected,  when  necessary.
      Any  such  decree  referred  to  in this subdivision shall set forth the
      several parcels taken by reference to the numbers of such parcels on the
      respective surveys, diagrams, maps,  or  plans,  and  it  shall  not  be
      necessary to describe any parcels acquired by metes and bounds.

        § 5-323 Final decree; how filed; effect. a. The final decree, together
      with  all  affidavits  and proofs upon which the same is based, shall be
      filed in the office of the clerk  of  the  county  in  which  the  order
      granting  the  application to condemn was filed, and a certified copy of
      such decree shall be filed in the office in which instruments  affecting
      real  property are required to be recorded, in every county in which any
      part of the real property affected is situated and shall be filed in the
      department of citywide administrative services of the city of New York.
        b. The final decree, unless set aside or reversed on appeal, shall  be
      final  and  conclusive  as  well upon the city as upon the owners of the
      real property  mentioned  therein,  and  also  upon  all  other  persons
      whomsoever.

        §  5-324 Appeal to appellate division. The city or any party or person
      affected by the proceeding and aggrieved by  the  final  decree  of  the
      court  therein  as to awards may appeal to the appellate division of the
      court. An appeal from the final decree of the court must be taken within
      thirty days after notice of the filing of such final decree.  Except  as
      herein  otherwise  provided, such appeal shall be taken and heard in the
      manner provided by the civil practice law and rules and  the  rules  and
      practice  of  the  court  in  relation to appeals from orders in special
      proceedings, and such appeal shall  be  heard  and  determined  by  such
      appellate  division  upon the merits both as to matters of law and fact.
      The determination of the appellate division shall be in the form  of  an
      order.  The  taking  of  an  appeal  by  any person or persons shall not
      operate to stay the proceedings under this subchapter except as  to  the
      particular  parcel  of real property with which the appeal is concerned.
      The final decree of the court shall be deemed to be final and conclusive
      upon all parties and persons affected thereby, who  have  not  appealed.
      Such  appeal shall be heard upon the evidence taken by the court or such
      part or portion thereof as the justice who made the decree may  certify,
      or  the  parties  to such appeal may agree upon as sufficient to present
      the merits of the questions in respect to which  such  appeal  shall  be
      had.  An  appeal  taken  but  not prosecuted within six months after the
      filing of the  notice  of  appeal,  unless  the  time  within  which  to
      prosecute  the  same  shall have been extended by an order of the court,
      shall be deemed to have been abandoned  and  no  agreement  between  the
      parties  extending  the  time within which such appeal may be prosecuted
      shall vary the provisions hereof. When a final decree of the court shall
      be reversed on appeal, such reversal shall not divest the city of  title
      to the real property affected by the appeal.
    
    
    
    
    
    
    

Section 5-325

Section 5-325 ::    
        
     
        §  5-325 Appeal to court of appeals. An appeal to the court of appeals
      may be taken by the city or  any  person  or  party  interested  in  the
      proceeding  and  aggrieved  by the order of the appellate division. Such
      appeal shall be taken and heard in the  manner  provided  by  the  civil
      practice  law  and  rules  and  the  rules  and practice of the court of
      appeals in relation to appeals from orders in  special  proceedings.  An
      appeal  taken  but  not prosecuted within six months after the filing of
      the notice of appeal, unless the time within which to prosecute the same
      shall have been extended by an order of the court, shall be deemed to be
      abandoned, and no agreement between the parties to the appeal  extending
      the  time  to  prosecute  the same shall vary the provisions hereof. The
      court of appeals may affirm or reverse the order appealed from, and  may
      make such order or direction as shall be appropriate to the case. If the
      final  decree  or decrees of the court shall be reversed by the court of
      appeals, such reversal shall not divest the city of title  to  the  real
      property affected by the appeal.

Section 5-326 ::    
        
     
        §  5-326  Taxation  of costs, charges and expenses. a. The bill of the
      reasonable and necessary costs, charges and expenses which  by  law  are
      required  to be taxed shall not be paid or allowed until they shall have
      been taxed by the court after notice given as in this section  provided.
      Upon  such  taxation, due proof of the nature and extent of the services
      rendered and the  disbursements  charged  shall  be  furnished,  and  no
      unnecessary  costs  or  charges  shall be allowed. All items in the bill
      shall be stated in detail and shall be accompanied by such proof of  the
      reasonableness thereof and the necessity therefor, as is now required by
      law   and  the  practice  of  the  court  upon  taxation  of  costs  and
      disbursements in other special proceedings or  actions  in  such  court.
      Proof  by  affidavit  shall  also  be  given  of  the dates of rendering
      services.  No  such  claim  for  compensation,  in  a  capital   project
      proceeding,  shall  be  allowed  or  paid  unless it be accompanied by a
      certificate of the comptroller setting forth  that  the  same  has  been
      audited  and  examined,  and further certifying the result of such audit
      and examination. Such certificate shall be presumptive evidence  of  the
      correctness, reasonableness and necessity of such bill.
        b.  In  a capital project proceeding, the corporation counsel shall be
      given five days' notice of the taxation of the bill  of  costs,  charges
      and expenses.
        c.  Property owners appearing in the proceedings shall not be entitled
      to recover counsel fees, costs, disbursements or allowances,  except  as
      provided  in  sections  seven  hundred  one and seven hundred two of the
      eminent domain procedure law.

Section 5-327 ::    
        
     
        § 5-327 Damages; when, how and to whom paid. a. All damages awarded by
      the  court,  with  interest  thereon  from  the  date  title to the real
      property acquired shall have vested in the city and all  costs,  charges
      and  expenses which may have been taxed shall be paid by the city to the
      respective owners mentioned or referred to in the final decree or to the
      persons in whose favor such costs, charges and expenses were  taxed,  as
      hereinafter provided.
        b.  In  a capital project proceeding, payment shall be made within two
      calendar months after the entry of the final decree. In default of  such
      payment,  the  owners  or  other  persons  entitled  to  be  paid in the
      proceeding  may  at  any  time  after  application  first  made  to  the
      comptroller  therefor,  sue  for and recover the amount due, with lawful
      interest, and the costs of  such  suit.  Upon  the  application  to  the
      comptroller  for  payment,  the applicant may state that any outstanding
      taxes, assessments or other  liens  may  be  deducted  from  the  amount
      otherwise   payable,  and  in  that  event,  the  fact  that  there  are
      outstanding taxes, assessments  or  other  liens  shall  not  impair  or
      invalidate  such  application  nor operate as a bar to the collection of
      interest upon the amount awarded less the  amount  of  such  outstanding
      taxes, assessments or other liens.
        c.  Payment  of  an award to a person named in the final decree as the
      owner thereof, if not under legal disability, shall in  the  absence  of
      notice  in writing to the comptroller of adverse claims thereto, protect
      the city.
        d. Where an award shall be paid to a person not entitled thereto,  the
      person  to  whom it ought to have been paid may sue for and recover such
      award, with lawful interest and costs of suit, as so much money had  and
      received  to  his  or  her use by the person to whom the same shall have
      been paid.
        e. 1. When an owner in whose favor an award shall have been made in  a
      final  decree,  shall be under legal disability or absent from the city,
      and when the name of the owner shall not be set forth  or  mentioned  in
      the  final  decree  or  when  the  owner, although named in such decree,
      cannot, upon diligent inquiry, be found, or where there are  adverse  or
      conflicting  claims to the money awarded as compensation, the city shall
      pay such award into the supreme  court,  to  be  secured,  disposed  of,
      invested  or paid out as such court shall direct, and such payment shall
      be as valid and effectual in all respects as if made  to  the  owner  or
      other person entitled thereto.
        2. In default of such payment into court, the city shall be and remain
      liable  for  such award, with lawful interest thereon from the date upon
      which title to the real property for which said award was made vested in
      the city, in a capital project proceeding.

Section 5-328 ::    
        
     
        §  5-328  Advance payments. The mayor may authorize the comptroller to
      pay to the person entitled to an award for real property acquired  in  a
      proceeding,  in  advance  of  the  final  determination of such person's
      damages pursuant to the requirements of article  three  of  the  eminent
      domain procedure law, a sum to be determined by the corporation counsel,
      after an appraisal of the damages sustained by such person by the expert
      or  experts  employed  by  the  corporation  counsel  less  any liens or
      encumbrances of  record  upon  such  property,  which  amount  shall  be
      certified to the comptroller by the corporation counsel. The mayor shall
      authorize  the  comptroller  to cause to be published in the City Record
      for ten consecutive days a notice stating that the comptroller is  ready
      to  pay  such  persons  entitled to awards for real property acquired in
      such proceeding, in advance of the final determination of their  damage.
      Such  notice  shall describe the property for which such advance payment
      may be made by tax block and lot numbers or the damage parcel numbers of
      the real property involved. Before any such  advance  payment  shall  be
      made,  the  comptroller shall procure the certificate of the corporation
      counsel showing the amount to be paid to the claimant, that said  amount
      does represent one hundred percent of the city's appraised valuation and
      that  the  person  to  whom  payment is to be made is the person legally
      entitled to receive the same. In case the person entitled to an award at
      the date of the vesting of title to the real property in the city  shall
      have  transferred  or  assigned  his  or  her  claim,  such  transfer or
      assignment made by such person, or by his or her successor  in  interest
      or  legal  representative, shall not become binding upon the city unless
      the instrument or instruments evidencing  such  transfer  or  assignment
      shall  have  been  executed  and  filed in the office of the comptroller
      prior to any such advance payment. When any such advance  payment  shall
      have  been made, the comptroller, on paying the awards made for the real
      property acquired,  shall  deduct  from  the  total  amount  allowed  as
      compensation the sum advanced plus interest thereon from the date of the
      payment  of such advance to the date of the final decree and the balance
      shall be paid as provided in section 5-327 of this subchapter.

-------------

Section 5-329 ::    
        
     
        §  5-329  Purchase  of  awards  by  the  city.  a.  In any proceedings
      instituted pursuant to any of the  provisions  of  this  subchapter,  or
      pursuant  to  the  provisions  of  any  other  statute providing for the
      acquisition of title to real  property  by  the  city,  in  which  title
      thereto  shall have become vested in such city prior to the entry of the
      final decree of the court, the mayor shall  have  power  and  is  hereby
      authorized  to purchase or to approve the purchase on behalf of the city
      from the individuals or corporations who were the owners  of  such  real
      property  at  the  date  of  the  vesting  of  title  thereto,  or their
      successors in interest or legal representatives, their right  and  title
      to  the  award  or  awards,  or  any  part  thereof,  to be made in such
      proceeding and to take an assignment thereof to the city. If such  owner
      or owners or their successors in interest or legal representatives shall
      have  transferred  or  assigned  such claim, such transfer or assignment
      made by such owner or owners or by their successors in interest or legal
      representatives shall not  become  binding  upon  the  city  unless  the
      instrument  or  instruments evidencing such transfer or assignment shall
      have been executed and  filed  in  the  office  of  the  comptroller  as
      provided in section 5-330 of this subchapter, prior to the completion of
      such purchase by the city.
        b.  An option granted to the city to purchase such award or awards for
      a period not to exceed six months shall not be  withdrawn  or  cancelled
      during the period named therein.

-------------

Section 5-330 ::    
        
     
        §  5-330  Instruments  assigning  or  pledging  awards. In case of the
      pledge, sale, transfer or assignment of an award by the person  entitled
      to  receive  the  same by virtue of the final decree of the court, or by
      other order of the court, the instrument evidencing such  pledge,  sale,
      transfer  or  assignment,  acknowledged  or  proved  as  instruments are
      required to be acknowledged or proved for the recording of transfers  of
      real  property,  shall  be  filed  in the office of the comptroller, who
      shall endorse on such instrument its number and the hour, day, month and
      year of its receipt. If an assignment of an award  be  contained  in  an
      instrument  recorded  in  an  office in which instruments affecting real
      property are by law required to be recorded, a  certified  copy  thereof
      may  be filed in the office of the comptroller in place of the original.
      An alphabetical index shall be kept under the names of  the  pledgor  or
      assignor,  and  of  the  pledgee  or  assignee, stating the title of the
      proceeding, the time of the filing of the instrument,  the  file  number
      thereof, and what part of the award is assigned thereby. A memorandum of
      the  file  number  of the instrument shall be made by the comptroller on
      the duplicate decree of the court opposite the place where the amount of
      the award so assigned is set forth. Every such instrument not  so  filed
      shall  be  void  as  against  any subsequent pledgee or assignee in good
      faith and  for  a  valuable  consideration  from  the  same  pledgor  or
      assignor, his or her heirs, administrators or assigns, of the same award
      or  any  portion thereof, the assignment of which is first duly filed in
      the office of the comptroller. Payment to the assignee or pledgee  shown
      to  be  entitled  to  the  award  by  such  record  in the office of the
      comptroller shall protect the city from liability to any other person or
      persons.

Section 5-331 ::    
        
     
        §  5-331  Correction of defects. The court at any time may correct any
      defect or informality in any notice, petition, pleading, order or decree
      in the proceeding, or cause  real  property  affected  by  such  defect,
      informality  or  lack of jurisdiction to be excluded therefrom, or other
      real  property  affected  by  such  defect,  informality  or   lack   of
      jurisdiction to be included therein by amendment, upon ten days' notice,
      published  and posted as provided for the institution of the proceeding,
      and may direct such further notices to be given to any party in interest
      as it shall deem proper.
    
    
    
    
    
    
    

Section 5-332
-------------

Section 5-332 ::    
        
     
        §  5-332  Order  to expedite proceeding. At any time after the date of
      entry of the order granting the application to condemn, the  corporation
      counsel,  or any owner may apply to the court for an order directing any
      owner or owners, or the corporation counsel, as the case may be, to show
      cause why further proceedings under this subchapter on the part of  such
      owner  or  owners or of the corporation counsel should not be expedited.
      Upon the hearing directed by such order to show cause, the court in  its
      discretion  may  make  an  order  directing  that  such  proceedings  be
      expedited in the manner stated therein  and  also  making  such  further
      directions with respect to the particulars shown upon the application as
      shall be just and proper in the premises.

-------------

Section 5-333 ::    
        
     
        §  5-333  Discontinuance  of  proceedings  by the mayor. The mayor may
      effect a discontinuance of any proceeding as to the whole or a  part  of
      the lands to be acquired in such proceeding, at any time before title to
      the  real property to be thereby acquired shall have vested in the city,
      and may cause new proceedings to be taken for the condemnation  of  such
      real  property.  In case of such discontinuance, however, the city shall
      adhere to the provisions of section seven hundred  two  of  the  eminent
      domain  procedure  law  and  the  reasonable  actual cash disbursements,
      necessarily incurred and made in good faith  by  any  party  interested,
      shall  be  paid  by  the city, after the same shall have been taxed by a
      justice of the supreme court, upon ten days'  notice  of  such  taxation
      being   previously  given  to  the  corporation  counsel,  provided  the
      application to have such disbursements taxed shall be made and presented
      to the court within one year after the action  of  the  mayor.  For  the
      purposes  of this section, the fair and reasonable value of the services
      of an attorney retained  by  any  interested  party  to  represent  such
      party's  interests  in  said  condemnation  proceedings,  whether  on  a
      contingent fee basis or otherwise, if such  retainer  be  made  in  good
      faith,  shall  be  deemed to be an actual cash disbursement, necessarily
      incurred by such interested party and  shall  be  taxable  in  the  same
      manner as other disbursements.  The amounts taxed as disbursements shall
      be  due and payable thirty days after written demand for payment thereof
      shall have been filed with the comptroller.

      project  proceeding  shall  become  and  be  seized  in  fee of or of an
      easement in, over, upon, or under such real property as  the  mayor  may
      have  determined,  the same to be held, appropriated, converted and used
      for the purposes for which the proceeding was instituted.
        c. The city or any person acting under its authority,  or  the  agency
      which  upon  the  acquisition  of  title to such real property will have
      jurisdiction thereof, shall immediately  or  any  time  thereafter  take
      possession  of  such property without suit or other judicial proceedings
      in accordance with the provisions of the eminent  domain  procedure  law
      pertaining to possession.

        § 5-335  Vesting of title; effect of, upon real property contracts. a.
      Where  the  whole  of any lot or parcel of real property, under lease or
      other contract,  shall  be  taken,  all  the  covenants,  contracts  and
      engagements between landlord and tenant or any other contracting parties
      touching the same, or any part thereof, upon the vesting of title in the
      city, shall cease and determine and be absolutely discharged. Where part
      only  of  any  lot  or  parcel  of real property so under lease or other
      contract shall be so taken, all contracts and engagements respecting the
      same, upon such vesting of title,  shall  cease  and  determine  and  be
      absolutely discharged, as to the part thereof so taken, but shall remain
      valid and obligatory as to the residue thereof.
        b.  All  persons  in  possession  of  such premises at the time of the
      vesting of title thereto in the city, shall at the option  of  the  city
      become  tenants  at  will  of  such  city  and shall, unless the parties
      otherwise agree in writing, pay the  same  rent  in  effect  immediately
      prior to vesting of title or unless within ten days after the vesting of
      title they shall elect to vacate and give up their respective holdings.
        c. Where a person or persons in possession of the premises at the time
      of  vesting  of  title  thereto  are  the owners thereof, such person or
      persons shall at the option of the city become tenants at will  of  such
      city, unless within ten days after the vesting of title they shall elect
      to  vacate and give up their holdings. Where such person or persons fail
      to vacate and give up their holdings, and become tenants at will of  the
      city as herein provided, such person or persons shall pay the reasonable
      value for the use and occupancy of the premises.
        d.  Where  a  person  in  possession  is  entitled to an award in such
      proceeding the rental as provided in subdivision b and the sum fixed for
      use and occupation as provided  in  subdivision  c  herein,  during  the
      period  between the date of vesting of title in the city and the date of
      the actual payment of the award, shall be a  lien  against  such  award,
      subject  only  to liens of record at the time of the vesting of title in
      the city.

      where rent is paid for the use of land on which  a  one  or  two  family
      dwelling  has  been constructed, in the event of condemnation for public
      use a separate award shall be made to  the  owner  of  the  land  and  a
      separate  award  shall be made to the owner of the dwelling except where
      there is a written agreement to the contrary.

      of what a single award would have been.

-------------

Section 5-337 ::    
        
     
        §  5-337  Title  acquired  for  streets  and  courtyards. a. The title
      acquired in real property required for any  streets  shall  be  kept  in
      trust,  that the same be appropriated and kept open for, or as part of a
      public street, forever, in like manner as the other streets in the  city
      are and of right ought to be.
        b.  The  mayor,  at  the  time of authorizing the proceedings in which
      lands are to be acquired for courtyard purposes, may  determine  whether
      the fee or an easement shall be acquired in lands required therefor, and
      the  mayor may prescribe such conditions and limitations on the title so
      to be acquired and as to the temporary or permanent use of the  land  so
      to  be  acquired  as he or she may deem proper. The title which the city
      shall acquire to the lands required for courtyard purposes shall be such
      as the mayor shall determine. Such title  shall  be  held  by  the  city
      subject to such limitations and conditions as to title thereto, or as to
      the  use thereof, as the mayor shall prescribe. If not inconsistent with
      such limitations and conditions as to title  or  as  to  the  use,  land
      acquired  for  courtyard  purposes may be devoted to general street uses
      whenever the board of estimate shall determine that the public  interest
      requires such use.
        c.  The title in fee acquired by the city to real property, except for
      street and courtyard purposes, shall be a fee simple absolute.

      laying  or  maintaining  in  the real property to be acquired for street
      purposes in a proceeding pursuant to this subchapter, underground  pipes
      or conduits for the distribution of water, gas, steam or electricity, or
      for  pneumatic service, such easement shall not be extinguished, but the
      title to the real property so to be acquired for the purposes authorized
      shall be taken subject to such easement; provided, however, that nothing
      herein contained shall be so construed as to limit the power of the city
      to acquire by purchase or by condemnation proceedings the  entire  plant
      or  service  of  such  individual  or  corporation,  or  to acquire such
      easement in such street in any other appropriate proceedings.

      as may be determined by  the  mayor  to  any  real  property  heretofore
      acquired through purchase or condemnation by any railroad corporation in
      the boroughs of Brooklyn and Queens for its corporate purposes and which
      real  property  lies  within  the  lines  of, is adjacent to, adjoins or
      separates any street or any part or parts thereof, now or hereafter laid
      out upon the city map, where the state  commissioner  of  transportation
      certifies  that  the ownership or exclusive use of such real property or
      easement thereover is no longer necessary to the carrying  out  of  such
      corporate  purposes.  Such title or easement, however, shall be acquired
      by the city subject to the right of the corporation to continue  to  use
      such  real  property  during the term of its corporate existence and for
      its corporate purposes, or in lieu thereof to use for a  like  term  and
      like  purposes  such other portion of the streets within which such real
      property shall lie, as the public service commission shall designate.
