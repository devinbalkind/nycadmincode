Section 15-301 ::    
        
     
        ยง 15-301 Declaration of policy. The council finds that within the past
      several  years there have been increasing incidences of arson which have
      endangered life and property in some areas of the city; that deaths  and
      serious  injuries  to  many  persons  have  resulted  therefrom and much
      property  has  been  destroyed;  that  extensive  areas  of   burned-out
      buildings  now  blight  parts  of  the  city;  that  arson  hastens  the
      deterioration of communities; that residents are compelled  to  flee  to
      other areas; that businesses and commercial enterprises are compelled to
      close,  many never to open again; that fire insurance premiums increase;
      and that drastic steps are necessary  to  prevent  the  spread  of  this
      problem  to other areas of the city. The council hereby declares that it
      is imperative that a permanent arson strike force  be  established  that
      will foster greater cooperation between the various city agencies in the
      battle to control the arson problem that confronts the city.
