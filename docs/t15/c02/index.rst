      a witness before such fire marshal, to testify in relation to any matter
      enumerated in section 15-218 of this title.

      commissioner shall be addressed to  the  owner  or  owners,  lessees  or
      occupants  of  the  building,  structure,  enclosure,  vessel,  place or

      or vessel, or to supply any structural deficiency  in  the  fire  alarm,
      fire   extinguishing,  or  fire  escape  equipment  thereof.  The  party
      offending shall pay the expense of enforcing such order and, in addition
      thereto, shall forfeit and pay  to  the  department  the  sum  of  fifty
      dollars.  Where  the  order  relates  to  the  storage  of  explosive or

---------------

Section 15-227. ::    
        
     
        §  15-227.  Violations;  order  to  vacate  building. a. Any building,
      structure, enclosure, vessel, place or  premises  perilous  to  life  or
      property  in  case of fire therein or adjacent thereto, by reason of the
      nature or condition of  its  contents,  its  use,  the  overcrowding  of
      persons  therein,  defects  in its construction, or deficiencies in fire
      alarm, fire extinguishing or fire escape equipment, or by reason of  any
      condition in violation of law, or order of the commissioner, is a public
      nuisance  within  the  meaning  of  the  code  and  the  penal  law. The
      commissioner is empowered to abate any such public nuisance.
        b. In case any order to remedy a condition eminently perilous to  life
      or property issued by the commissioner or the department is not complied
      with,  or the commissioner certifies in writing that an emergency exists
      requiring such action, he or she may order  and  immediately  cause  any
      building  or  structure or part thereof (i) to be vacated; and, also, if
      the commissioner determines such action is necessary to the preservation
      of life and safety, (ii) to be sealed,  secured  and  closed;  provided,
      however,  that  the  commissioner  shall  not order sealed, secured, and
      closed any dwelling unit or other space lawfully  used  for  residential
      purposes.  Upon  the  issuance of an order to seal, secure and close, no
      person shall have access to such premises except as  authorized  by  the
      commissioner.  For  the  purpose  of  this section, "sealed, secured and
      closed" shall mean  the  use  of  any  means  available  to  render  the
      building,  structure  or  part  thereof  inaccessible, including but not
      limited to the use of a padlock or cinder blocks.
        c. All orders issued pursuant to this section shall be posted upon the
      premises. Immediately upon the posting of an order  upon  the  premises,
      officers  and  employees  of  the police department, the department, and
      other authorized officers and employees of the  city  shall  immediately
      act upon and enforce such order. The police department shall provide all
      reasonable  assistance  to  the department and other authorized officers
      and employees necessary to carry out the provisions of this section.  If
      an order issued pursuant to this section is not complied with within the
      time  designated therein, the commissioner, in addition to or in lieu of
      any other remedy or power, may apply to the supreme court, at a  special
      term  thereof,  without  notice,  for  an  order directing him or her to
      vacate and/or seal, secure and close such building  or  premises  or  so
      much  thereof  as  he  or  she  may  deem necessary, and prohibiting and
      enjoining all persons from using or occupying the same for  any  purpose
      until such measures are taken as may be required by such order.
        d.  (i)  Any  order  to seal, secure and close issued pursuant to item
      (ii) of subdivision b of  this  section  shall  contain  notice  of  the
      opportunity  for  a  hearing with respect to such order, to determine if
      the order was properly issued in accordance with the provisions of  this
      section.  Such hearing shall be conducted by the commissioner, or in the
      commissioner's discretion, by the office of  administrative  trials  and
      hearings  or  the environmental control board. If the matter is referred
      to such office or board, the hearing officer shall  submit  his  or  her
      findings  of  fact  and  a recommended decision to the commissioner. The
      hearing shall be held within three business days after  the  receipt  of
      the  written  request  of an owner, lessor, lessee or mortgagee for such
      hearing and the  commissioner  shall  render  a  decision  within  three
      business days after such hearing is concluded.
        (ii)  Any  order  issued  pursuant  to this section shall be served in
      accordance with section 15-224 of the code and, in  addition,  shall  be
      mailed  to the record owner of such premises and any record mortgagee of
      such premises at the address  for  such  person  as  set  forth  in  the
      recorded  instrument  and  to the person designated as owner or agent of
      the building or designated to receive real property tax or  water  bills
    
      for  the building at the address for such person contained in one of the
      files compiled by the department of  finance  for  the  purpose  of  the
      assessment  or collection of real property taxes and water charges or in
      the  file  compiled  by  the  department  of  finance from real property
      transfer forms filed with the city register upon the sale or transfer of
      real property. A copy shall also be filed with the county clerk  of  the
      county  in  which such premises are located. Such filing shall be notice
      of the order to any subsequent owner and such owner shall be subject  to
      such order.
        e.  An  order  issued  pursuant to this section shall not be rescinded
      unless the owner, lessor, lessee or mortgagee  seeking  such  rescission
      provides assurance, in a form satisfactory to the commissioner, that the
      conditions  which  caused the issuance of such order have been corrected
      and will not reoccur. If such order is rescinded, upon  the  request  of
      the owner, lessor, lessee or mortgagee, the commissioner shall provide a
      certified  copy  of  such rescission, which may be filed with the county
      clerk of the county in which such premises are located.
        f. The commissioner shall give written notice of the  closing  of  any
      building  or structure or part thereof pursuant to this section, and any
      subsequent actions taken with respect thereto, as soon  as  practicable,
      to (i) the borough president of the borough within which the closing has
      occurred; (ii) the council member representing the district within which
      the  closing  has  occurred;  and  (iii)  the  local community board. On
      January first of each year, the commissioner shall submit  a  report  to
      the  council,  setting forth the number of closings made in the previous
      year, the locations of such closings, and the  nature  and  use  of  the
      premises  closed.  The  commissioner  shall,  in  addition,  as  soon as
      practicable after a building, structure or part thereof has been closed,
      make and publish a report of said closing  in  a  manner  calculated  to
      quickly  notify  the local community in which such closing occurred. The
      commissioner shall also make  and  publish  a  report  of  any  premises
      reopened  pursuant  to his or her permission under this section. Failure
      to comply with this subdivision shall not invalidate any action taken by
      the commissioner pursuant to this section.

        §  15-227.1  Penalties  for  violation of order to vacate and order to
      seal, secure and close; access to premises. a. Any person  who  violates
      the  provisions  of an order to vacate issued pursuant to section 15-227
      of this code shall be liable for  a  civil  penalty  of  not  more  than
      twenty-five thousand dollars and an additional civil penalty of not more
      than one thousand dollars for each day the violation continues.
        b. Except as authorized by the commissioner, any person who removes or
      causes  to  be  removed  the seal from any premises sealed in accordance
      with an order of the commissioner or his or her designee shall be guilty
      of a misdemeanor punishable by imprisonment for no more than one year or
      a fine not to exceed fifty thousand  dollars,  or  both  such  fine  and
      imprisonment.  Such  person shall also be subject to a civil penalty not
      to exceed fifty thousand dollars.
        c. The commissioner shall allow access to the premises to an owner, or
      a lessor, lessee or mortgagee, in  accordance  with  the  terms  of  the
      parties' lease or mortgage agreement, upon the following conditions: (i)
      the   submission   of   a   written  affirmation,  satisfactory  to  the
      commissioner, that such person or persons will commence or cause  to  be
      commenced  without  delay  all  work necessary to correct the conditions
      stated in the vacate order or otherwise to make  the  premises  suitable
      for a lawful use and will complete such work within a period of time and
      in  a  manner to be approved by the commissioner; (ii) the submission of
      an  affirmation  or  other  proof  satisfactory  to   the   commissioner
      describing  the  steps  that  have  been  taken and will be taken in the
      future to ensure that the premises will be used or operated in a  lawful
      manner  and  specifying  such  lawful use; (iii) if a license, permit or
      certificate  of  occupancy  is  necessary  for  such  lawful  use,   the
      submission  of a written affirmation or other proof, satisfactory to the
      commissioner, describing the steps that have  been  taken  and  will  be
      taken  in  the  future  to  ensure  that  such  premises will be used or
      operated in compliance with any law requiring such  license,  permit  or
      certificate  of  occupancy;  and (iv) if the premises are leased and the
      person making the affirmations described in items (i), (ii) and (iii) is
      not such lessee, the commissioner may also require any authorized person
      seeking access pursuant to this subdivision to submit an affirmation  or
      other  proof  that  proceedings  to  enable  such person to take actions
      necessary to ensure compliance with the affirmations submitted  by  such
      authorized  person  pursuant  to  items  (i),  (ii)  and (iii) have been
      commenced.
        d. Any person who makes a material false  statement  in  any  document
      submitted  pursuant  to subdivision c of this section which statement he
      or she knows  or  has  reason  to  know  will  be  relied  upon  by  the
      commissioner  in  determining whether he or she will allow access to the
      premises shall be liable for a civil penalty  of  not  more  than  fifty
      thousand dollars.
        e.  Notwithstanding  any  other  law, rule, or regulation, any person,
      corporation, partnership, association or  any  other  legal  entity  who
      permits  a building, structure or part thereof to be unlawfully occupied
      or used in contravention of an order of  the  commissioner  pursuant  to
      section  15-227,  or  who  negligently fails to prevent or prohibit such
      unlawful occupancy or use, shall be liable for a civil  penalty  of  not
      more  than  one  million  dollars,  if  any other person suffers serious
      physical injury, as defined in section ten of the penal law, or death in
      the building, structure or part thereof subject  to  such  order,  as  a
      result  of  such  unlawful  occupancy  or  use.  If more than one person
      suffers  serious  physical  injury  or  death,  such  penalty  shall  be
      recoverable  for  each  person  suffering  injury or death. Such penalty
      shall be recovered in a civil action brought by the corporation  counsel
    
      in  the  name  of  the  city  in any court of competent jurisdiction. In
      determining the amount of the civil penalty  to  be  imposed  the  court
      shall consider:
        (i)  the  extent and severity of injury to persons and property caused
      by the violation;
        (ii) the history of violations by the defendant at such  premises,  or
      any  other  premises,  of  laws,  rules  or  regulations enforced by the
      department;
        (iii) the degree of willfulness, recklessness, or negligence displayed
      by the defendant in committing the subject violation;
        (iv) the defendant's financial resources; and
        (v) the defendant's good faith efforts to cure the subject  violation,
      including  efforts  to  obtain entry to or possession of the premises in
      order to do so.
        In the event that any person seriously injured or the  family  of  any
      person  who  has  died  as  the  result of any unlawful occupancy or use
      described in this subdivision is unable to collect a judgment  recovered
      in  a  civil  action  for  personal  injury  or wrongful death against a
      defendant who has violated this subdivision because of the insolvency of
      such defendant, the city may, in its discretion,  pay  to  such  injured
      person  or  the family of such deceased person an amount, as hereinafter
      provided, collected from such defendant in an  action  relating  to  the
      same  injury  or death commenced by the corporation counsel against such
      defendant pursuant  to  this  subdivision.  Payments  pursuant  to  this
      subdivision  shall  be  made  as  a matter of grace and shall be in such
      amounts and in accordance with such standards and procedures as shall be
      established by the mayor,  provided,  however,  that  any  payment  made
      pursuant  to  this  subdivision  shall  be  in  an  amount not exceeding
      out-of-pocket expenses, including indebtedness reasonably  incurred  for
      medical or other services necessary as a result of the injury upon which
      such  action  is  based; loss of earnings or support resulting from such
      injury; burial expenses not exceeding two thousand five hundred  dollars
      of  a  person  who  died  as  a result of such unlawful occupancy or use
      described in this subdivision; and the unreimbursed cost  of  repair  or
      replacement  of articles of essential personal property lost, damaged or
      destroyed as a direct result of such unlawful occupancy or  use.  In  no
      event  shall  the  payment  made to any person exceed the amount of such
      person's uncollected judgment for personal injury or wrongful death  and
      in  no  event  shall the total amount paid to any number of persons with
      such uncollected judgments against a single defendent exceed the  actual
      amount collected by the city from such defendant in an action under this
      subdivision.

      to or as an alternative to any of the remedies and penalties provided in
      any  laws,  rules,  or  regulations  enforceable  by the department, any
      person who shall violate or fail to comply with any such laws, rules, or
      regulations  shall,  except  as  otherwise  specifically   provided   in
      subdivision c of section 15-230, be liable for a civil penalty which may
      be  recovered  in  a  proceeding before the environmental control board.
      Such proceeding shall be  commenced  by  the  service  of  a  notice  of
      violation  returnable before the board. Except as otherwise specifically
      provided, such civil penalty shall be determined  as  follows:  (1)  The
      maximum  penalty  for  the first violation shall be one thousand dollars
      ($1,000); (2) the maximum penalty for  the  second  and  any  subsequent
      violation of the same provision of law, rule or regulation shall be five
      thousand  dollars  ($5,000),  provided the violation is committed by the
      same respondent, is for the same provision of law, rule  or  regulation,
      and  occurs  within  eighteen  months  of first violation, and provided,
      further, that if the respondent is the owner,  agent,  lessee  or  other
      person  in  control  of the premises with respect to which the violation
      occurred, the violation occurred at the same premises.
        * b. For the  purposes  of  the  multiple  offense  schedule,  if  the
      respondent  is  the  owner  or  agent  of the building or structure with
      respect to which the violation  occurred  or  a  lessee  of  the  entire
      building  or structure, the term premises shall mean the entire building
      or structure. If the respondent is the lessee or person in control of  a
      part  of  such  building or structure, the term premises shall mean that
      part of such building or structure leased to or under the control of the
      respondent.

      respondent  is  the  owner  or  agent  of the building or structure with
      respect to which the violation  occurred  or  a  lessee  of  the  entire
      building  or  structure,  a prior violation by the same respondent shall
      not serve as a predicate for purposes of the multiple  offense  schedule
      set  forth  in  this section if the prior violation or the violation for
      which penalties are to  be  imposed  occurred  within  an  area  of  the
      building or structure which, at the time of the violation, was leased to
      and  under the control of a person other than the respondent except that
      this provision shall not apply if  both  the  prior  violation  and  the
      violation  for  which  penalties are to be imposed occurred within areas
      leased to and under the control of the same lessee.  In  any  proceeding
      before  the  board,  the  burden of proof with respect to this exception
      shall be upon the respondent.

      separate provision of law, rule or regulation based  on  the  degree  of
      seriousness  of  the  violation. Such maximum penalties shall not exceed
      the maximum penalties for such violation set forth in this section.

        * §  15-230  Environmental control board proceedings; order to certify
      correction. a. Except as otherwise provided in  subdivision  e  of  this
      section,  whenever  the  commissioner  serves a notice of violation such
      notice shall include an order which requires the respondent  to  correct
      the  condition  constituting  the  violation and to file a certification
      with the department that the condition has been  corrected.  Such  order
      shall  require  that  the condition be corrected within thirty days from
      the date that  the  order  is  issued  and  that  certification  of  the
      correction  of  the  condition  shall  be filed with the department in a
      manner and form and within such further  period  of  time  as  shall  be
      established by rule or regulation of the department.
        b.  If  the  board  finds,  upon good cause shown, that the respondent
      cannot correct the violation within the period specified in  subdivision
      a, it may, with the concurrence of the commissioner, postpone the period
      for  compliance  with  such order upon such terms and conditions and for
      such period of time as shall be appropriate under the circumstances.
        c. For violations which are subject  to  the  penalties  for  a  first
      violation  as  set  forth  in section 15-229, if the respondent complies
      with the order issued pursuant to subdivision a of this  section  within
      the  time  set forth in such subdivision there shall be no civil penalty
      for such  first  violation.  Such  violation  may  however  serve  as  a
      predicate  for  purposes  of  the multiple offense schedule set forth in
